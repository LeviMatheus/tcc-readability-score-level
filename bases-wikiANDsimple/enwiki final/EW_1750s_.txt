The 1750's decade ran from January 1, 1750, to December 31, 1759. The 1750s was a pioneering decade. Waves of settlers flooded the New World (specifically the Americas) in hopes of re-establishing new life away from European control, and electricity was a field of novelty that have yet to be merged with the studies of chemistry and engineering. Much of the modern scientific studies today, are the products of this era, â€“ many of the discoveries of the 1750s, forged the basis of contemporary scientific consensus. As the Baroque era comes into an end, the world enters an age of enlightenment following the conclusion of this decade.
