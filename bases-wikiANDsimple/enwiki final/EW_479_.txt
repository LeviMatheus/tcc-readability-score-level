Year 479 (CDLXXIX) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Zeno without colleague (or, less frequently, year 1232 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 479 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
