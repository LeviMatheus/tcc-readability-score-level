This is a list of stars down to magnitude +2.50, as determined by their "maximum", "total", or "combined" visual magnitudes as viewed from Earth. Although several of the brightest stars are known binary or multiple star systems and are relatively close to Earth, they appear to the naked eye as single stars. The list below combines/adds the magnitudes of bright individual components. Most of the proper names in this list are those approved by the Working Group on Star Names. Popular star names that have not been approved by the IAU may appear here with a short note.
Measurement.
The Sun is the brightest star as viewed from Earth. The apparent visual magnitudes of the brightest stars can also be compared to non-stellar objects in our Solar System. Here the maximum visible magnitudes above the second brightest star, Sirius (−1.46), are as follows. Excluding the Sun, the brightest objects are the Moon (−12.7), Venus (−4.89), Jupiter (−2.94), Mars (−2.91), Mercury (−2.45), and Saturn (−0.49).
Any exact order of the visual brightness of stars is not perfectly defined for four reasons:
