After registering a steady increase during Soviet period, the population of Armenia declined from peak value 3.633 million in 1992 to 2.986 million in 2017.
The country's population has declined due to increased emigration since the break-up of the Soviet Union. The rates of emigration and population decline, however, have decreased in recent years, and there has been a moderate influx of Armenians returning to Armenia.
Human development.
According to 2018 HDI statistical update (with data for 2017) compared to all its neighboring countries Armenia has:
Since 1990 Armenia recorded steady growth of average annual HDI scores in every reported period (1990–2000, 2000–2010, 2010–2017).
According to 2016 Sustainable Society Index Armenia has higher rank of Human Wellbeing than all its neighbours. At the same time its Economic Wellbeing rank is below neighbouring countries.

Vital statistics.
Life expectancy.
According to 2018 HDI statistical update compared to all its neighboring countries Armenia has highest health expenditures as percentage of GDP and highest healthy life expectancy at birth.
In 2016 the average life expectancy at birth for males was 71.6 years and for females was 78.3 years, with the average at 75.0 years.
After a setback during 1986–1996 mostly due to the Spitak Earthquake and the First Nagorno-Karabakh War, Armenia regained its position and was consistently among the top three former Soviet republics during 1997–2016, topping the list in 2007.
During the Soviet period, life expectancy was traditionally high in Armenia and topped all other republics of USSR and most of countries in Eastern Europe in 1978–1980.

Vital statistics summary data.
1 The numbers of life births and deaths until 1959 were calculated from the birth rate and death rate, respectively
2 The high number of deaths in 1988 is related to the Spitak earthquake While in the rest of the 20th century the death rate was equal to the rate of other European countries (excluding England). 
3 The population estimate for 2012 has been recalculated on the basis of the 2011 Census.

Armenia is considered the first nation to adopt Christianity, which was first preached in Armenia by two Apostles of Jesus, St. Bartholomew and St. Thaddeus in the 1st century. The Armenian Apostolic Church can trace its roots back to the 3rd and 4th centuries. The country formally adopted the Christian faith in 301 A.D. Over 90% of Armenians belong to the Armenian Apostolic Church. It is a very ritualistic, conservative church, roughly comparable to the Coptic and Syrian churches. Armenia also has a population of Catholics and evangelical Protestants.

Migration.
Compared to its neighbouring countries Armenia has the highest share of immigrants (6.5% of total population, 2017 data).
The estimated number of population net migration is −24.8 thousand persons, according to the Integrated living conditions survey of households of 2016; for urban population −13.8 thousand and for rural population −11.0 thousand persons.
24.9% of households were involved in external and internal migration processes over the period of 2013– 2016. Migration directions were distributed as follows: 12% – internal, 10.5% – Republic of Artsakh, rest (76.4%) – international (of which 89.8% – Russia). Among household members of age 15 and above, who left the place of their permanent residence in 2013–2016 for 3 months and longer and had not returned as of 2016, 11.9% were in Armenia, 13.0% in Artsakh, and 75.1% in other countries, predominantly in the Russian Federation. More than 54% of migrant household members of the age 15 years and above sent money and/ or goods to their families/relatives/friends within the 12 months preceding the survey.
According to 2019 UN data, emigration rate averaged to annually 1.7 per 1000 inhabitants in years 2015–2020 and is expected to remain same until year 2045. These are below average emigration rate of 11.5 per 1000 in years 2000–2010 and even below the emigration rate of 3.2 per 1000 in years 1980–1985.
Wealth and poverty.
Inequality.
Out of 41 emerging economies Armenia was among only 4, which recorded rising inequality (measured by Gini coefficient) in years 2007–2015.
Wealth.
According to Global Wealth Report prepared by Credit Suisse mean wealth per adult in Armenia in 2019 is estimated at $19,517 rising 9 times from estimated $2,177 in year 2000. Mean wealth per adult in Armenia surpasses corresponding values for neighboring countries Georgia and Azerbaijan by over 50%, all CIS countries except Russia and Kazakhstan, and neighboring Iran. Growth rate of mean wealth per adult between 2000 and 2019 with the value of 9 times beats all neighboring countries, most of CIS countries and even all Baltic countries (Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia).
Median wealth per adult is reported at $8,309 in 2019, above the world average, rising 9.6 times from $862 in year 2000.
Between 2000 and 2019 average debts per adult grew 28.7 times to $1,261, or 6.5% of wealth per adult (below 11.9% world average).
55% of adults own less than $10,000, 42.7% — $10,000–$100,000, 2.2% — $100,000–$1 million and 0.1% — over $1 million. The share of adults owning less than $10,000 with the value of 55% is less than corresponding value in each of CIS countries, neighboring Iran and Turkey, as well as the world average. Gini coefficient for wealth is reported at 66.3%, less than 82.4% European average and 88.5% world average.
Poverty.
As much as 53.5 % of the country’s population was officially considered poor in 2004. Poverty fell significantly in the following years amid double-digit economic growth that came to an end with the onset of the global financial crisis in late 2008. It soared to almost 36 % in 2010, one year after Armenia’s Gross Domestic Product shrunk by over 14 %. Afterward, there was a decreasing trend throughout the last years reaching 23.5 % in 2018, down from 25.7 percent in 2017.
The poverty indicators in Shirak, Lori, Kotayk, Tavush and Armavir provinces are higher than the country average. The highest poverty rate in the country has been recorded in Shirak province, where 46% of the population is below the poverty line. To overcome poverty, Armenia would need AMD 63.2 billion, or an amount equal to 1.2% of GDP, in addition to the resources already allocated for social assistance, assuming that such assistance would be efficiently targeted to the poor only.
In terms of the international poverty line corresponding to US$1.25 in 2005 PPP poverty in Armenia went down from 19.3% in the year 2001 to 1.5% in the year 2008 and remained nearly unchanged until the year 2015 moving in the range of 1.5% – 2.7%.
