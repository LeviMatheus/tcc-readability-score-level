Sigismund (variants: Sigmund, ) is a German proper name, meaning "protection through victory", from Old High German "sigu" "victory" + "munt" "hand, protection". Tacitus latinises it "Segimundus". There appears to be an older form of the High German word "Sieg" (victory): "sigis", obviously Gothic and an inferred Germanic form, and there is a younger form: "sigi", which is Old Saxon or Old High German "sigu" (both from about 9th century). A 5th century Prince of Burgundy was known both as "Sigismund" and "Sigimund" (see Ernst Förstemann, "Altdeutsche Personennamen", 1906; Henning Kaufmann, "Altdeutsche Personennamen", Ergänzungsband,1968).
Its Hungarian equivalent is Zsigmond.
A Lithuanian name Žygimantas, meaning "wealth of (military) campaign", from Lithuanian "žygis" "campaign, march" + "manta" "goods, wealth" has been a substitution of the name "Sigismund" in the Lithuanian language, from which it was adopted by the Ruthenian language as Жыгімонт (such are the cases of Sigismund Kestutaitis, Sigismund Korybut, Sigismund I the Old, Sigismund II Augustus). The Polish spelling is Zygmunt, and the Croatian variant is Žigmund.
