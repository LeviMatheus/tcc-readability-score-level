China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a country in East Asia. It is the world's most populous country, with a population of around 1.4 billion. China covers an area of approximately 9.6 million square kilometers (3.7 million mi2), it is the world's third or fourth-largest country. 
The country is officially divided into 23 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.
China emerged as one of the world's first civilizations, in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the North China Plain. China was one of the world's foremost economic powers for most of the two millennia from the 1st until the 19th century. For millennia, China's political system was based on absolute hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, beginning with the Xia dynasty in 21st century BCE. Since then, China has expanded, fractured, and re-unified numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, the Qin reunited core China and established the first Chinese empire. The succeeding Han dynasty (206 BCE–220 CE) saw some of the most advanced technology at that time, including papermaking and the compass, along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of gunpowder and movable type in the Tang dynasty (618–907) and Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127) completed the Four Great Inventions. Tang culture spread widely in Asia, as the new Silk Route brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa. The Qing Empire, China's last dynasty, which formed the territorial basis for modern China suffered heavy losses to foreign imperialism. The Chinese monarchy collapsed in 1912 with the 1911 Revolution, when the Republic of China (ROC) replaced the Qing dynasty. China was invaded by the Empire of Japan during World War II. The Chinese Civil War resulted in a division of territory in 1949 when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China on mainland China while the Kuomintang-led ROC government retreated to the island of Taiwan. Both the PRC and the ROC currently claim to be the sole legitimate government of China, resulting in an ongoing dispute even after the United Nations recognized the PRC as the government to represent China at all UN conferences in 1971.
China is nominally a unitary one-party socialist republic. The country is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a founding member of several multilateral and regional cooperation organizations such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and is a member of the BRICS, the G8+5, the G20, the APEC, and the East Asia Summit. Chinese authorities have been criticized by political dissidents and human rights activists for widespread human rights abuses, including political repression, mass censorship, mass surveillance of their citizens and violent suppression of protests.
After economic reforms in 1978, and its entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, China's economy became the second-largest country by nominal GDP in 2010 and grew to the largest in the world by PPP in 2014. China is the world's fastest-growing major economy, the second-wealthiest nation in the world, and the world's largest manufacturer and exporter. The nation has the world's largest standing army — the People's Liberation Army — the second-largest defense budget, and is a recognized nuclear-weapons state. China has been characterized as a potential superpower due to its large economy and powerful military.
Etymology.
The word "China" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not a word used by the Chinese themselves during this period in time. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word "Chīna", used in ancient India.
"China" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa. Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian "Chīn" (), which was in turn derived from Sanskrit "Cīna" (). "Cīna" was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the "Mahābhārata" (5th century BCE) and the "Laws of Manu" (2nd century BCE). In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE). Although this derivation is still given in various sources, the origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate, according to the "Oxford English Dictionary". Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.
The official name of the modern state is the "People's Republic of China" (). The shorter form is "China" ' () from ' ("central") and "" ("state"), a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne. It was then applied to the area around Luoyi (present-day Luoyang) during the Eastern Zhou and then to China's Central Plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the Qing. It was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the Huaxia people from perceived "barbarians". The name "Zhongguo" is also translated as in English. China (PRC) is sometimes referred to as the Mainland when distinguishing the ROC from the PRC.
History.
Prehistory.
Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago. The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a "Homo erectus" who used fire, were discovered in a cave at Zhoukoudian near Beijing; they have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago. The fossilized teeth of "Homo sapiens" (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave in Dao County, Hunan. Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 7000 BCE, at Damaidi around 6000 BCE, Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.
Early dynastic rule.
According to Chinese tradition, the first dynasty was the Xia, which emerged around 2100 BCE. The Xia dynasty marked the beginning of China's political system based on hereditary monarchies, or dynasties, which lasted for a millennium. The dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early Bronze Age sites at Erlitou, Henan in 1959. It remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the Xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period. The succeeding Shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records. The Shang ruled the plain of the Yellow River in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BCE. Their oracle bone script (from BCE) represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found and is a direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.
The Shang was conquered by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king, and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were only seven powerful states left.
Imperial China.
The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six kingdoms, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths (i.e., cart axles' length), and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Vietnam. The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death, as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.
Following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at Xianyang was burned, the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and CE 220, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the Han Chinese. The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, South Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world. Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.
After the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the Four Classics of Chinese literature. At its end, Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then invaded and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects, largely integrating them into Chinese culture. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581. The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.
Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age. The Tang Empire retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road, which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa, and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan Rebellion in the 8th century. In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and Khitan Liao. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.
Between the 10th and 11th centuries, the population of China doubled in size to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang, and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity. However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jurchen Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Huizong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song Wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China.
The 13th century brought the Mongol conquest of China. In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty; the Yuan conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300. A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.
In the early years of the Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations. The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury.
In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.
Late imperial.
The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. Its conquest of the Ming (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives and the economy of China shrank drastically. After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire. The centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, the "Haijin" ("sea ban"), and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing social and technological stagnation. In the mid-19th century, the dynasty experienced Western imperialism in the Opium Wars with Britain and France. China was forced to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of the Unequal Treaties. The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.
The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest. The initial success of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.
In the 19th century, the great [[Chinese emigration|Chinese diaspora]] began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879]], in which between 9 and 13 million people died. The [[Guangxu Emperor]] drafted a [[Hundred Days' Reform|reform plan]] in 1898 to establish a modern [[constitutional monarchy]], but these plans were thwarted by the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]]. The ill-fated anti-foreign [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms, the [[Xinhai Revolution]] of 1911–1912 brought an end to the Qing dynasty and established the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. [[Puyi]], the last Emperor of China, abdicated in 1912.
Republic (1912–1949).
[[File:Republic of China proclaimtion.png|thumb|upright=1.0|left|Sun Yat-sen proclaiming the establishment of the ROC in 1912]]
On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and [[Sun Yat-sen]] of the [[Kuomintang]] (the KMT or Nationalist Party) was proclaimed provisional president. However, the presidency was later given to [[Yuan Shikai]], a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Emperor of China]]. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own [[Beiyang Army]], he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic.
After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory. In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang, under [[Chiang Kai-shek]], the then Principal of the [[Republic of China Military Academy]], was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings, known collectively as the [[Northern Expedition]]. The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to [[Nanjing]] and implemented "political tutelage", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's [[San-min Doctrine|San-min]] program for transforming China into a modern democratic state. The [[List of warlords and military cliques in the Warlord Era|political division]] in China made it difficult for Chiang to battle the [[Chinese Communists|communist]] [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), against whom the Kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. This war continued successfully for the Kuomintang, especially after the PLA retreated in the [[Long March]], until Japanese aggression and the 1936 [[Xi'an Incident]] forced Chiang to confront [[Imperial Japan]].

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), a [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of [[World War II]], forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the PLA. Japanese forces committed numerous [[Japanese war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died. An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese [[Nanking Massacre|were massacred]] in the city of Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation. During the war, China, along with the UK, the United States, and the [[Soviet Union]], were referred to as "trusteeship of the powerful" and were recognized as the Allied "[[Four Policemen|Big Four]]" in the [[Declaration by United Nations]]. Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major [[Allies of World War II]], and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war. After the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, Taiwan, including the [[Pescadores]], was [[Retrocession Day|returned to Chinese control]]. China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China|ROC constitution]] were never implemented in mainland China.
People's Republic (1949–present).

Major combat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of most of [[mainland China]], and the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Kuomintang retreating offshore]], reducing its territory to only [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]], [[Hainan]], and their surrounding islands. On 21 September 1949, [[Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] [[Proclamation of the People's Republic of China|proclaimed]] the establishment of the People's Republic of China with a speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference followed by a public proclamation and celebration in [[Tiananmen Square]]. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army [[Landing Operation on Hainan Island|captured Hainan]] from the ROC and [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|incorporated Tibet]]. However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage [[Kuomintang Islamic insurgency|an insurgency in western China]] throughout the 1950s.

The regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform, which included the [[Mass killings of landlords under Mao Zedong|execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords]]. China developed an independent industrial system and [[China and weapons of mass destruction|its own nuclear weapons]]. The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974. However, the [[Great Leap Forward]], an idealistic massive reform project, resulted in [[Great Chinese Famine|an estimated 15 to 35 million deaths]] between 1958 and 1961, mostly from starvation. In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced the Republic]] in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.
After Mao's death, the [[Gang of Four]] was quickly arrested by [[Hua Guofeng]] and held responsible for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. [[Eight Elders|Elder]] [[Deng Xiaoping]] took power in 1978, and instituted significant [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]]. The Party loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives, and the [[People's commune|communes]] were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households. This marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an [[Socialist market economy|increasingly open-market environment]]. China adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982. In 1989, the [[People's Liberation Army at Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|suppression]] of [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|student protests in Tiananmen Square]] brought condemnations and sanctions against the Chinese government from various foreign countries.
[[Jiang Zemin]], [[Li Peng]] and [[Zhu Rongji]] led the nation in the 1990s. Under their administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated 150 million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%. The country joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 2001, and maintained its high rate of economic growth under [[Hu Jintao]] and [[Wen Jiabao]]'s leadership in the 2000s. However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment, and caused [[Protest and dissent in the People's Republic of China|major social displacement]].
[[Chinese Communist Party]] [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]] has ruled since 2012 and has pursued large-scale efforts to reform China's economy (which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth), and has also reformed the [[one-child policy]] and prison system, as well as instituting a vast [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti corruption crackdown]]. In 2013, China initiated the [[Belt and Road Initiative]], a global infrastructure investment project. The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] broke out in Wuhan, Hubei in 2019.
Geography.
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map CHN present.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|right|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification]] map for mainland China.]]
China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert]]s in the arid north to the [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from much of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the [[Pacific Ocean]] is long and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the [[Eurasian Steppe]] which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] – the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Road]](s).
Landscape and climate.
The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. The [[geographical center]] of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at . China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154 m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].
[[File:1 li jiang guilin yangshuo 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|[[Li River]] near [[Guilin]], [[Guangxi]]]]
China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.
A major environmental issue in China is the continued [[desertification|expansion of its deserts]], particularly the Gobi Desert. Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of [[sandstorms]], prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in [[Asian dust|dust storms]] plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. China's environmental watchdog, [[Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China|SEPA]], stated in 2007 that China is losing per year to desertification. Water quality, [[erosion]], and [[Pollution in China|pollution control]] have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting [[glaciers]] in the Himalayas could potentially lead to [[water shortage]]s for hundreds of millions of people. According to academics, in order to limit [[climate change in China]] to electricity generation from [[coal in China]] without [[carbon capture]] must be phased out by 2045. Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels. Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.
Biodiversity.
[[File:Giant Panda Eating.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|A [[giant panda]], China's most famous [[List of endangered and protected species of China|endangered]] and [[endemic]] species, at the [[Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding]] in [[Sichuan]]]]
China is one of 17 [[megadiverse countries]], lying in two of the world's major [[biogeographic realm]]s: the [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]] and the [[Indomalayan realm|Indomalayan]]. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after [[Brazil]] and [[Colombia]]. The country signed the [[Rio de Janeiro]] [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 11 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 5 January 1993. It later produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], with one revision that was received by the convention on 21 September 2010.
China is home to at least 551 species of [[List of mammals of China|mammals]] (the third-highest such number in the world), 1,221 species of birds (eighth), 424 species of reptiles (seventh) and 333 species of amphibians (seventh). Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure, from the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 [[List of endangered and protected species of China|animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction]] in China, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and ingredients for [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and , the country has over 2,349 [[Protected areas of China|nature reserves]], covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area. The [[Baiji]] was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.
China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants, and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold [[coniferous]] forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as [[moose]] and [[Asian black bear]], along with over 120 bird species. The [[understory]] of moist [[conifer]] forests may contain thickets of [[bamboo]]. In higher [[Montane ecosystems|montane]] stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]], the bamboo is replaced by [[rhododendron]]s. [[Subtropical]] forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal [[rainforest]]s, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China. China has over 10,000 recorded species of [[fungi]], and of them, nearly 6,000 are [[higher fungi]].
Environment.
[[File:ThreeGorgesDam-China2009.jpg|thumb|The [[Three Gorges Dam]] is the largest hydroelectric dam in the world.]]
In recent decades, China has suffered from [[environmental issues in China|severe environmental deterioration and pollution]]. While regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, they are poorly enforced, as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development. China is the country with the second highest death toll because of air pollution, after [[Environmental issues in India|India]]. There are approximately 1 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution. China is the [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|world's largest carbon dioxide emitter]], and has been ranked as the 13th largest in [[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions per capita|emissions per capita]]. The country also has significant [[water pollution]] problems: 8.2% of China's rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste in 2019, and were unfit for use. China had a 2018 [[Forest Landscape Integrity Index]] mean score of 7.14/10, ranking it 53rd globally out of 172 countries.
However, China is the world's leading investor in [[renewable energy]] and [[Renewable energy commercialization|its commercialization]], with [[US$|$]]52 billion invested in 2011 alone; it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects. By 2015, over 24% of China's energy was derived from renewable sources, while most notably from [[hydroelectric power]]: a total installed capacity of 197 [[Gigawatt|GW]] makes China the [[Hydroelectricity#World hydroelectric capacity|largest hydroelectric power producer]] in the world. China also has the largest power capacity of [[Solar power by country|installed solar photovoltaics system]] and [[Wind power by country|wind power system]] in the world. [[Greenhouse gas emissions by China]] are the [[List of countries by greenhouse gas emissions|world's largest]], as is [[renewable energy in China]].
Political geography.
[[File:China administrative.svg|200px|thumb|left|Map showing the territorial claims of the PRC.]]
The People's Republic of China is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest]] country in the world by land area after [[Russia]], and is the third largest by total area, after Russia and Canada. China's total area is generally stated as being approximately . Specific area figures range from according to the "[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]", to according to the UN Demographic Yearbook, and the [[CIA World Factbook]].
China has the [[List of land border lengths|longest combined land border in the world]], measuring from the mouth of the [[Yalu River]] (Amnok River) to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. China [[Borders of China|borders 14 nations]], [[List of countries by number of neighbouring countries|more than any other country]] except Russia, which also borders 14. China extends across much of East Asia, bordering [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]] in Southeast Asia; [[India]], [[Bhutan]], [[Nepal]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]] in South Asia; [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in Central Asia; and [[Russia]], [[Mongolia]], and [[North Korea]] in [[Inner Asia]] and [[Northeast Asia]]. Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Vietnam]], and the [[Philippines]].
Politics.
[[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|The Chinese constitution]] states that The People's Republic of China "is a socialist state governed by a people’s democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants," and that the state institutions "shall practice the principle of democratic centralism." The PRC is one of the world's only [[socialist state]]s [[Ideology of the Communist Party of China|explicitly aiming to build communism]]. The Chinese government has been variously described as communist and socialist, but also as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and [[Corporatism|corporatist]], with heavy restrictions in many areas, most notably against [[Internet censorship in China|free access to the Internet]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly]], [[reproductive rights|the right to have children]], [[NGO|free formation of social organizations]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Its current political, ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as a "[[Socialist consultative democracy|consultative democracy]]" "[[people's democratic dictatorship]]", "[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]" (which is [[Marxism]] adapted to Chinese circumstances) and the "[[socialist market economy]]" respectively.
Communist Party.
[[File:18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.jpg|thumb|[[Communist Party of China]] is the founding and ruling political party of China.|alt=|left]]
Since 2018, the main body of the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|Chinese constitution]] declares that "the defining feature of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] is the leadership of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP)." The 2018 amendments constitutionalized the "de facto" [[one-party state]] status of China, wherein the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party|General Secretary]] ([[Leader of the Chinese Communist Party|party leader]]) holds ultimate power and authority over state and government and serves as the [[Paramount leader (China)|paramount leader of China]]. The current General Secretary is [[Xi Jinping]], who took office on 15 November 2012 and was re-elected on 25 October 2017. The [[elections in the People's Republic of China|electoral system]] is pyramidal. Local People's Congresses are [[direct election|directly elected]], and higher levels of People's Congresses up to the [[National People's Congress]] (NPC) are [[indirect election|indirectly elected]] by the People's Congress of the level immediately below. [[List of political parties in China|Another eight political parties]], have representatives in the NPC and the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC). China supports the Leninist principle of "[[democratic centralism]]", but critics describe the elected National People's Congress as a "[[rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]]" body.
Government.
China is a [[one-party state]] led by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP). The National People's Congress in 2018 altered the country's constitution to remove the two-term limit on holding the Presidency of China, permitting the current leader, [[Xi Jinping]], to remain president of China (and General Secretary of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]) for an unlimited time, governing as a [[dictator]]. The [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] is the titular [[head of state]], elected by the [[National People's Congress]]. The [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]], presiding over the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] composed of four vice premiers and the heads of ministries and commissions. The incumbent president is [[Xi Jinping]], who is also the [[General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party]] and the [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission (China)|Chairman of the Central Military Commission]], making him China's [[Paramount leader (China)|paramount leader]]. The incumbent premier is [[Li Keqiang]], who is also a senior member of the [[CPC Politburo Standing Committee]], China's "de facto" top decision-making body.
In 2017, Xi called on the communist party to further tighten its grip on the country, to uphold the unity of the party leadership, and achieve the "Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation". Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption. Nonetheless, the level of public support for the government and its management of the nation is high, with 80–95% of Chinese citizens expressing satisfaction with the central government, according to a 2011 survey.
Administrative divisions.
The People's Republic of China is divided into 22 [[Provinces of China|provinces]], five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] (each with a designated minority group), and four [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]]—collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]"—as well as the [[special administrative region]]s (SARs) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: [[North China]], [[Northeast China]], [[East China]], [[South Central China]], [[Southwest China]], and [[Northwest China]].
China considers [[Taiwan]] to be [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|its 23rd province]], although Taiwan is governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), which rejects the PRC's claim. Conversely, the ROC claims sovereignty over all divisions governed by the PRC.
Foreign relations.
[[File:Diplomatic relations of the People's Republic of China.svg|upright=1.4|thumb|left|Diplomatic relations of China]]
The PRC has [[List of diplomatic missions in China|diplomatic relations]] with 175 countries and maintains [[List of diplomatic missions of the People's Republic of China|embassies in 162]]. In 2019, China had the largest diplomatic network in the world. Its [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] is disputed by the Republic of China and a few other countries; it is thus the largest and most populous [[List of states with limited recognition|state with limited recognition]]. In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]]. China was also a former member and leader of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and still considers itself an advocate for [[developing countries]]. Along with Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa, China is a member of the [[BRICS]] group of emerging major economies and hosted the group's [[2011 BRICS summit|third official summit]] at [[Sanya]], [[Hainan]] in April 2011.
Under its interpretation of the [[One-China policy]], Beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to Taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the Republic of China. Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan, especially in the matter of armament sales.
Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier [[Zhou Enlai]]'s [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]], and is also driven by the concept of "harmony without uniformity", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This policy may have led China to support states that are [[rogue state|regarded as dangerous]] or repressive by Western nations, such as [[China–Zimbabwe relations|Zimbabwe]], [[China–North Korea relations|North Korea]] and [[China–Iran relations|Iran]]. China has a [[Sino-Russian relations since 1991|close economic and military relationship]] with Russia, and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.
Trade relations.
[[File:Russia and China sign major gas deal.jpeg|thumb|230px|On 21 May 2014, China and [[Russia]] signed a $400 billion [[Natural gas in Russia|gas deal]]. Currently, Russia is supplying [[List of countries by natural gas exports|natural gas]] to China.]]
China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013, as measured by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's biggest commodity importer. comprising roughly 45% of maritime's [[Shipping markets|dry-bulk market]].
By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries. China is the largest trading partner for the [[ASEAN]] nations, with a total trade value of $345.8 billion in 2015 accounting for 15.2% of ASEAN's total trade. ASEAN is also China's largest trading partner. In 2020, China became the largest trading partner of the [[European Union]] for goods, with the total value of goods trade reaching nearly $700 billion. China, along with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, is a member of the [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]], the world's largest free-trade area covering 30% of the world's population and economic output. China became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) in 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues. The EAS, which includes [[ASEAN Plus Three]], India, Australia and New Zealand, held its inaugural summit in 2005.
China has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the [[United States Congress]] approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries. China has a significant [[trade surplus]] with the United States, its most important export market. In the early 2010s, US politicians argued that the [[Chinese yuan]] was significantly undervalued, giving China an unfair trade advantage.
Since the turn of the century, China has followed a policy of [[Involvement of the People's Republic of China in Africa|engaging with African nations]] for trade and bilateral co-operation; in 2019, Sino-African trade totalled $208 billion, having grown 20 times over two decades. According to Madison Condon "China finances more infrastructure projects in Africa than the World Bank and provides billions of dollars in low-interest loans to the continent’s emerging economies." China maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union. China has furthermore strengthened its trade ties with major South American economies, and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others.

China's [[Belt and Road Initiative]] has expanded significantly over the last six years and, as of April 2020, includes 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus here is particularly on building efficient transport routes. The focus is particularly on the [[21st Century Maritime Silk Road|maritime Silk Road]] with its connections to East Africa and Europe and there are Chinese investments or related declarations of intent at numerous ports such as [[Gwadar]], [[Kuantan]], [[Hambantota]], [[Piraeus]] and [[Trieste]]. However many of these loans made under the Belt and Road program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for [[debt relief]] from debtor nations.
Territorial disputes.
Taiwan.
[[File:China administrative.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Map depicting territorial disputes between the PRC and neighbouring states. For a larger map, [[Template:PRC provinces big imagemap|see here]].]]
Ever since its establishment after the [[Chinese Civil War]], the PRC has claimed [[Free area of the Republic of China|the territories]] governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the [[island of Taiwan]] as its [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as a part of [[Fujian Province]] and islands the ROC controls in the [[South China Sea]] as a part of [[Hainan Province]] and [[Guangdong Province]]. These claims are controversial because of the complicated [[Cross-Strait relations]], with the PRC treating the [[One-China policy]] as one of its most important diplomatic principles.
Land border disputes.
China has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them. As of 2020, China currently has a disputed land border with only [[Sino-Indian border dispute|India]] and [[Bhutan]].
Maritime border disputes.
China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the [[Senkaku Islands dispute|Senkaku Islands]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal standoff|Scarborough Shoal]].
Sociopolitical issues and human rights.
[[File:港人燭光遊行至中聯辦悼念劉曉波 12.jpg|thumb|March in memory of Chinese [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate [[Liu Xiaobo]] who died of organ failure while in government custody in 2017]]
China uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, surveillance of personal technology, and a social credit system as a means of social control of persons living in China. The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and some members of the Chinese Communist Party believe in the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the "fundamental rights" of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]]. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state. Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling [[Chinese Communist Party|Communist Party]] are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information, most notably on the Internet, are routinely used to prevent collective action. By 2020, China plans to give all its citizens a personal "Social Credit" score based on how they behave. The [[Social Credit System]], now being piloted in a number of Chinese cities, is considered a form of [[Mass surveillance in China|mass surveillance]] which uses [[big data analysis]] technology.
A number of foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and [[NGO]]s have criticized [[Human rights in China|China's human rights record]], alleging widespread [[civil rights]] violations such as detention without trial, [[forced abortions]], forced confessions, [[torture]], restrictions of fundamental rights, and [[Capital punishment in the People's Republic of China|excessive use of the death penalty]]. The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to "social stability", as was the case with the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].
The Chinese state is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in [[Human rights in Tibet|Tibet]] and [[Uyghur genocide|Xinjiang]], including violent police crackdowns and [[religious suppression]] throughout the Chinese nation. At least one million members of [[Islam in China|China's Muslim]] [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] minority have been detained in [[Xinjiang re-education camps|mass detention camps]], termed "Vocational Education and Training Centers", aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. According to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], actions including political [[indoctrination]], [[torture]], [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] abuse, [[Compulsory sterilization|forced sterilization]], [[sexual abuse]], and [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] are common in these facilities. The state has also sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in Xinjiang, intimidating foreign-based reporters by detaining their family members. According to a 2020 report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets UN definition of genocide, and several groups called for a UN investigation. On 19 January 2021, the [[United States Secretary of State]], [[Mike Pompeo]], announced that the [[United States Department of State]] had determined that "genocide and crimes against humanity" had been perpetrated by China against the Uyghurs.
[[File:Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protest (48108594957).jpg|thumb|[[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]]]]
Global studies from [[Pew Research Center]] in 2014 and 2017 ranked the Chinese government's restrictions on religion as among the highest in the world, despite low to moderate rankings for religious-related social hostilities in the country. The [[Global Slavery Index]] estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people were living in "conditions of modern [[Slavery in China|slavery]]", or 0.25% of the population, including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013 but it is not clear the extent to which its various practices have stopped. The Chinese penal system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps, which fall under the heading [[Laogai]] ("reform through labor"). The Laogai Research Foundation in the United States estimated that there were over a thousand slave labour prisons and camps, known collectively as the Laogai.
In 2019 a study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on [[Organ transplantation in China|organ transplantation]], because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners. While the government says 10,000 transplants occur each year, hospital data shows between 60,000 and 100,000 organs are transplanted each year. The report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed [[prisoners of conscience]].
Military.
[[File:Vostok-2018 military manoeuvres (2018-09-13) 51.jpg|thumb|Chinese, Russian and Mongolian national flags set on armored vehicles during the large-scale military exercise [[Vostok 2018]] in Eastern Siberia]]
With 2.3 million active troops, the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) is the largest standing military force in the world, commanded by the [[Central Military Commission (People's Republic of China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC). China has the second-biggest military reserve force, only behind [[North Korea]]. The PLA consists of the [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Ground Force]] (PLAGF), the [[People's Liberation Army Navy|Navy]] (PLAN), the [[People's Liberation Army Air Force|Air Force]] (PLAAF), and the [[People's Liberation Army Rocket Force]] (PLARF). According to the Chinese government, China's military budget for 2017 totalled US$151.5 billion, constituting the [[List of countries by military expenditures|world's second-largest military budget]], although the [[List of countries by military expenditure share of GDP|military expenditures-GDP ratio]] with 1.3% of GDP is below world average. However, many authorities – including [[SIPRI]] and the U.S. [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] – argue that China does not report its real level of military spending, which is allegedly much higher than the official budget.
Economy.
[[File:Graph of Major Developing Economies by Real GDP per capita at PPP 1990-2013.png|thumb|China and other major developing economies by [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita at purchasing-power parity]], 1990–2013. The rapid economic growth of China (blue) is readily apparent.]]
Since 2010, China had [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|the world's second-largest economy]] in terms of nominal GDP, totaling approximately US$15.66 trillion (101.6 trillion Yuan) as of 2020. In terms of [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP GDP), China's economy has been the largest in the world since 2014, according to the World Bank. According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $14.28 trillion by 2019. China's economic growth has been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]]. China is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. Between 2010 and 2019, China's contribution to global GDP growth has been 25% to 39%.
China had the [[Economic history of China before 1912|largest economy in the world]] for most of the [[Pax Sinica|past two thousand years]], during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline. Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world—[[Shanghai Stock Exchange|Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange|Hong Kong]] and [[Shenzhen Stock Exchange|Shenzhen]]—that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020. China has four ([[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Beijing]], and [[Shenzhen]]) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers, which is more than any country in the 2020 [[Global Financial Centres Index]]. By 2035, China's four cities (Shanghai, Beijing, [[Guangzhou]] and Shenzhen) are projected to be among the global top ten largest cities by [[nominal GDP]] according to a report by Oxford Economics.
China has been the world's No. 1 manufacturer since 2010, after overtaking the US, which had been No. 1 for the previous hundred years. China has also been No. 2 in high-tech manufacturing since 2012, according to US [[National Science Foundation]]. China is the second largest retail market in the world, next to the United States. China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for 40% of the global market share in 2016 and more than 50% of the global market share in 2019. China is the world's leader in electric vehicles, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world in 2018. China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries. China had 174 GW of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018, which amounts to more than 40% of the global solar capacity.
Foreign and Chinese sources have claimed that official Chinese government statistics overstate China's economic growth. However, several Western academics and institutions have stated that China's economic growth is higher than indicated by official figures.
China has a large [[Informal economy of China|informal economy]], which arose as a result of the country's economic opening. The informal economy is a source of employment and income for workers, but it is unrecognized and suffers from lower productivity. In 2020, hundreds of individual Chinese drug vendors illegally manufactured synthetic drugs such as fentanyl for export.
Wealth in China.
[[File:Shanghai skyscrapers 5166285.jpg|thumb|left|[[Shanghai World Financial Center]], [[Jin Mao Tower]] and [[Shanghai Tower|Shanghai Tower, Lujiazui]]]]
As of 2018, China was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires—there were 658 Chinese billionaires and 3.5 million millionaires. In 2019, China overtook the US as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world, according to the global wealth report by [[Credit Suisse]]. In other words, as of 2019, 100 million Chinese are in the top 10% of the wealthiest individuals in the world—those who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000. As of October 2020, China has the world's highest number of billionaires with nearly 878, increasing at the rate of roughly five per week. According to the [[Hurun]] Global Rich List 2020, China is home to five of the world's top ten cities ([[Beijing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Shenzhen]], and [[Guangzhou]] in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 10th spots, respectively) by the highest number of billionaires, which is more than any other country. China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021, two-thirds of the global total, and minted 24 new female billionaires in 2020.
However, it ranks behind over 60 countries (out of around 180) in per capita economic output, making it an upper-middle income country. Additionally, its development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions. China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million. China reduced the extreme poverty rate—per international standard, it refers to an income of less than $1.90/day—from 88% in 1981 to 1.85% by 2013. According to the World Bank, the number of Chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013. The portion of people in China living below the international poverty line of $1.90 per day (2011 [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]) fell to 0.3% in 2018 from 66.3% in 1990. Using the lower-middle income poverty line of $3.20 per day, the portion fell to 2.9% in 2018 from 90.0% in 1990. Using the upper-middle income poverty line of $5.50 per day, the portion fell to 17.0% from 98.3% in 1990.
Economic growth.
[[File:Prc1952-2005gdp.gif|thumb|China's nominal [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] trend from 1952 to 2015]]
From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership, and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]]. The state still dominates in strategic "pillar" sectors such as energy production and [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008. In 2018, private enterprises in China accounted for 60% of GDP, 80% of urban employment and 90% of new jobs.
In the early 2010s, China's economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles, weakening international demand for Chinese exports and fragility in the global economy. China's GDP was slightly larger than Germany's in 2007; however, by 2017, China's $12.2 trillion-economy became larger than those of Germany, UK, France and Italy combined. In 2018, the IMF reiterated its forecast that China will overtake the US in terms of nominal GDP by the year 2030. Economists also expect China's middle class to expand to 600 million people by 2025.
China in the global economy.
China is a member of the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] and is the world's largest trading power, with a total international trade value of US$4.62 trillion in 2018. [[Foreign exchange reserves of the People's Republic of China|Its foreign exchange reserves]] reached US$3.1 trillion as of 2019, making its reserves by far the world's largest. In 2012, China was the world's largest recipient of inward [[foreign direct investment]] (FDI), attracting $253 billion. In 2014, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US64 billion making it the second largest recipient of remittances in the world. China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $62.4 billion in 2012, and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies. China is a major owner of [[US public debt]], holding trillions of dollars worth of U.S. [[Treasury bond]]s. China's undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies, and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of [[counterfeit]] goods.
Following the 2007–08 financial crisis, Chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system. To achieve those ends, China took a series of actions to further the [[internationalization of the Renminbi]]. In 2008, China established [[dim sum bond]] market and expanded the Cross-Border Trade RMB Settlement Pilot Project, which helps establish pools of offshore RMB liquidity. This was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with Russia, [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[Singapore]], the United Kingdom, and Canada. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the eighth-most-traded currency in the world, an emerging international [[reserve currency]], and a component of the IMF's [[special drawing rights]]; however, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, Dollar and Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.
Class and income inequality.
China has had the world's largest middle class population since 2015, and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018. In 2020, a study by the [[Brookings Institution]] forecast that China's middle-class will reach 1.2 billion by 2027 (almost 4 times the entire U.S. population today), making up one fourth of the world total. Wages in China have grown a lot in the last 40 years—real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007. By 2018, median wages in Chinese cities such as Shanghai were about the same as or higher than the wages in Eastern European countries. China has the world's highest number of billionaires, with nearly 878 as of October 2020, increasing at the rate of roughly five per week. China has a high level of economic inequality, which has increased in the past few decades. In 2018 China's GINI index was 0.467, according to the World Bank.
Science and technology.
Historical.
[[File:Chinese Gunpowder Formula.JPG|thumb|Earliest known written formula for gunpowder, from the "[[Wujing Zongyao]]" of 1044 CE]]
China was once a world leader in science and technology up until the [[Ming dynasty]]. Ancient [[List of Chinese discoveries|Chinese discoveries]] and [[List of Chinese inventions|inventions]], such as [[papermaking]], [[History of typography in East Asia|printing]], the [[compass]], and [[gunpowder]] (the [[Four Great Inventions]]), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later to Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use [[negative numbers#History|negative numbers]]. By the 17th century, Europe and the Western world surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement. The causes of this early modern [[Great Divergence]] continue to be debated by scholars to this day.
After repeated [[Eight-Nation Alliance|military defeats]] by the European colonial powers and [[First Sino-Japanese war|Japan]] in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the [[Soviet Union]], in which scientific research was part of central planning. After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the [[Four Modernizations]], and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.
Modern era.

Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research and is quickly catching up with the US in R&amp;D spending. In 2017, China spent $279 billion on scientific research and development. According to the [[OECD]], China spent 2.11% of its GDP on research and development (R&amp;D) in 2016. Science and technology are seen as vital for achieving China's economic and political goals, and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as "techno-nationalism". According to the [[World Intellectual Property Indicators]], China received 1.54 million patent applications in 2018, representing nearly half of patent applications worldwide, more than double the US. In 2019, China was No. 1 in international patents application. Chinese tech companies [[Huawei]] and [[ZTE]] were the top 2 filers of international patents in 2017. Chinese-born scientists have won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] four times, the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] once respectively, though most of these scientists conducted their Nobel-winning research in western nations.

China is developing [[Education in China|its education system]] with an emphasis on [[STEM fields|science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)]]; in 2009, China graduated over 10,000 PhD engineers, and as many as 500,000 [[BSc]] graduates, more than any other country. China also became the world's largest publisher of [[Academic publishing in China|scientific papers]] in 2016. Chinese technology companies such as Huawei and [[Lenovo]] have become world leaders in telecommunications and personal computing, and Chinese [[supercomputer]]s are consistently ranked among the [[TOP500|world's most powerful]]. China has been the world's largest market for industrial robots since 2013 and will account for 45% of newly installed robots from 2019 to 2021. China ranks 14th on the [[Global Innovation Index]] and is the only middle-income economy, the only [[Emerging market|emerging country]], and the only [[newly industrialized country]] in the top 30. China ranks first globally in the important indicators, including patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports and also has 2 ([[Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area|Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou]] and [[Beijing]] in the 2nd and 4th spots respectively) of the global top 5 science and technology clusters, which is more than any country.
The [[Chinese space program]] is one of the world's most active. In 1970, China launched its first satellite, [[Dong Fang Hong I]], becoming the fifth country to do so independently. In 2003, China became the third country to independently send humans into space, with [[Yang Liwei]]'s spaceflight aboard [[Shenzhou 5]]; , [[List of Chinese astronauts|ten Chinese nationals]] have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China's first space station module, [[Tiangong-1]], was launched, marking the first step in a project to assemble [[Chinese space station|a large crewed station]] by the early 2020s. In 2013, China successfully landed the [[Chang'e 3]] lander and [[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]] rover onto the lunar surface. In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe—[[Chang'e 4]]—on the far side of the moon. In 2020, [[Chang'e 5]] successfully returned moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently after the United States and the Soviet Union. In 2021, China became the second nation in history to independently land a [[Zhurong (rover)|rover (Zhurong)]] on Mars, joining the United States.
Infrastructure.
After a decades-long infrastructural boom, China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: China has the [[High-speed rail by country|world's largest bullet train network]], the [[List of supertall skyscrapers|most supertall skyscrapers]] in the world, the world's largest power plant (the [[Three Gorges Dam]]), the largest energy generation capacity in the world, a [[BeiDou|global satellite navigation system]] with the largest number of satellites in the world, and has initiated the [[Belt and Road Initiative]], a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50–100 billion per year. The Belt and Road Initiative could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.
Telecommunications.
[[File:P1994-2011.gif|thumb|280px|Internet penetration rates in China in the context of [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]], 1995–2012]]
China is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the [[List of countries by number of mobile phones in use|largest number of active cellphones]] of any country in the world, with over 1.5 billion subscribers, as of 2018. It also has the world's largest number of [[List of countries by number of Internet users|internet]] and [[List of countries by number of broadband Internet users|broadband users]], with over 800 million Internet users —equivalent to around 60% of its population—and almost all of them being mobile as well. By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total. China is making rapid advances in [[5G]]—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.
[[China Mobile]], [[China Unicom]] and [[China Telecom]], are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the biggest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018. Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China. Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably [[Huawei]] and [[ZTE]], have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.
China has developed its own [[satellite navigation]] system, dubbed [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|Beidou]], which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012 as well as global services by the end of 2018. The 35th and final satellite of Beidou constellation was launched into orbit on 23 June 2020, thus becoming the 3rd completed global navigation satellite system in service after [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[GLONASS]].
Transport.
[[File:Duge Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The [[Duge Bridge]] is the [[List of highest bridges|highest bridge in the world]].]]
Since the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of [[China National Highways|national highways]] and [[Expressways of China|expressways]]. In 2018, [[Expressways of China|China's highways]] had reached a total length of , making it the [[List of countries by road network size|longest highway system in the world]]. China has the world's largest market for automobiles, having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and [[List of countries by motor vehicle production|production]]. A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents, though the number of fatalities in traffic accidents fell by 20% from 2007 to 2017. In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – , there are approximately 470 million bicycles in China.
[[File:BCIA Aerial.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Terminal 3 of [[Beijing Capital International Airport]] is the 2nd-largest airport terminal in the world.]]
[[Rail transport in China|China's railways]], which are [[China Railway Corporation|state-owned]], are among [[Rail usage statistics by country|the busiest in the world]], handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006. As of 2017, the country had of railways, the [[List of countries by rail transport network size|second longest network in the world]]. The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the [[Chinese New Year]] holiday, when the [[Chunyun|world's largest annual human migration]] takes place.
China's [[High-speed rail in China|high-speed rail (HSR) system]] started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2019, [[High-speed rail in China|high speed rail in China]] had over of dedicated lines alone, making it the [[High-speed rail by country|longest HSR network in the world]]. Services on the [[Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway|Beijing–Shanghai]], [[Beijing–Tianjin intercity railway|Beijing–Tianjin]], and [[Chengdu–Chongqing intercity railway|Chengdu–Chongqing]] Lines reach up to , making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.29 billion passengers in 2019 it is the world's busiest. The network includes the [[Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong High-Speed Railway|Beijing–Guangzhou–Shenzhen High-Speed Railway]], the single longest HSR line in the world, and the [[Beijing–Shanghai High-Speed Railway]], which has [[List of longest bridges in the world|three of longest railroad bridges in the world]]. The [[Shanghai Maglev Train]], which reaches , is the fastest commercial train service in the world.
[[File:Yangshan Port 20170923-3.jpg|thumb|The [[Port of Shanghai]]'s deep water harbor on [[Yangshan Port|Yangshan Island]] in the [[Hangzhou Bay]] is from 2010 the [[List of world's busiest container ports|world's busiest container port]]]]
Since 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated. , 44 Chinese cities have [[Urban rail transit in China|urban mass transit systems]] in operation and 39 more have metro systems approved. As of 2020, China boasts the five longest [[List of metro systems|metro systems in the world]] with the networks in [[Shanghai Metro|Shanghai]], [[Beijing Subway|Beijing]], [[Guangzhou Metro|Guangzhou]], [[Chengdu Metro|Chengdu]] and [[Shenzhen Metro|Shenzhen]] being the largest.
There were [[List of airports in China|approximately 229 airports in 2017]], with around 240 planned by 2020. China has over 2,000 [[List of ports in China|river and seaports]], about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping. In 2017, the Ports of [[Port of Shanghai|Shanghai]], [[Port of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Port of Shenzhen|Shenzhen]], [[Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan|Ningbo-Zhoushan]], [[Port of Guangzhou|Guangzhou]], [[Port of Qingdao|Qingdao]] and [[Port of Tianjin|Tianjin]] ranked in the Top 10 in the world [[List of world's busiest container ports|in container traffic]] and [[List of world's busiest container ports|cargo tonnage]].
Water supply and sanitation.
Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as [[Water resources of China|water scarcity, contamination, and pollution]]. According to data presented by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] in 2015, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to [[improved sanitation]]. The ongoing [[South–North Water Transfer Project]] intends to abate water shortage in the north.
Demographics.
[[File:PRC Population Density.svg|thumb|left|A 2009 population density map of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan. The eastern coastal provinces are much more densely populated than the western interior.]]
The [[Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China|national census of 2010]] recorded the [[population]] of the People's Republic of China as approximately 1,370,536,875. About 16.60% of the population were 14 years old or younger, 70.14% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 13.26% were over 60 years old. The population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0.46%. China used to make up much of the world's poor; now it makes up much of the world's middle class. Although a middle-income country by Western standards, China's rapid growth has [[Poverty in China|pulled hundreds of millions]]—800 million, to be more precise—of its people out of poverty since 1978. By 2013, less than 2% of the Chinese population lived below the international poverty line of US$1.9 per day, down from 88% in 1981. China's own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019. From 2009 to 2018, the unemployment rate in China has averaged about 4%.
Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a "1.5"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child. In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [[two-child policy]]. Data from the 2010 census implies that the [[total fertility rate]] may be around 1.4, although due to under-reporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.
According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth or the size of the total population. However, these scholars have been challenged. Their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that China averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions, with one-child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction.
The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the [[human sex ratio|sex ratio]] at birth. According to the 2010 census, the sex ratio at birth was 118.06 boys for every 100 girls, which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls. The 2010 census found that males accounted for 51.27 percent of the total population. However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.82 percent of the total population.
Ethnic groups.
[[File:China ethnolinguistic 1967.jpg|thumb|Ethnolinguistic map of China]]
China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who altogether comprise the "[[Zhonghua Minzu]]". The largest of these nationalities are the ethnic Chinese or "Han", who constitute more than 90% of the total
population. The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group – outnumber other ethnic groups in every provincial-level division except [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] and [[Xinjiang]]. Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2010 census. Compared with the 2000 population census, the Han population increased by 66,537,177 persons, or 5.74%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 7,362,627 persons, or 6.92%. The 2010 census recorded a total of 593,832 foreign nationals living in China. The largest such groups were from South Korea (120,750), the
United States (71,493) and Japan (66,159).
Languages.
[[File:China Post logo with (New) Tai Lü script in Mohan, Yunnan.jpg|thumb|A trilingual sign in [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Sibsongbanna]], with [[Tai Lü language]] on the top]]
There are as many as 292 [[living language]]s in China. The languages most commonly spoken belong to the [[Sinitic languages|Sinitic branch]] of the [[Sino-Tibetan language]] family, which contains [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (spoken by 70% of the population), and [[Varieties of Chinese|other varieties]] of [[Chinese language]]: [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (including [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]), [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (including [[Shanghainese]] and [[Suzhounese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (including [[Fuzhounese]], [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] and [[Hakka language|Hakka]]. Languages of the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman branch]], including [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Qiang language|Qiang]], [[Naxi language|Naxi]] and [[Yi language|Yi]], are spoken across the [[Tibetan Plateau|Tibetan]] and [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]]. Other ethnic minority languages in [[southwest China]] include [[Zhuang language|Zhuang]], [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Dong language (China)|Dong]] and [[Sui language|Sui]] of the [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai family]], [[Hmongic language|Miao]] and [[Mienic languages|Yao]] of the [[Hmong–Mien languages|Hmong–Mien family]], and [[Wa language|Wa]] of the [[Austroasiatic Languages|Austroasiatic family]]. Across [[Northeastern China|northeastern]] and [[northwestern China]], local ethnic groups speak [[Altaic languages]] including [[Manchu language|Manchu]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]] and several [[Turkic languages]]: [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Salar language|Salar]] and [[Western Yugur language|Western Yugur]]. [[Korean language|Korean]] is spoken natively along the border with [[North Korea]]. [[Sarikoli language|Sarikoli]], the language of [[Tajiks of Xinjiang|Tajiks in western Xinjiang]], is an [[Indo-European language]]. [[Taiwanese aborigines]], including a small population on the mainland, speak [[Austronesian languages]].
[[Standard Mandarin]], a variety of Mandarin based on the [[Beijing dialect]], is the official national language of China and is used as a [[lingua franca]] in the country between people of different linguistic backgrounds. Mongolian, Uyghur, Tibetan, Zhuang and various other languages are also regionally recognized throughout the country.
[[Chinese characters]] have been used as the [[writing system|written script]] for the Sinitic languages for thousands of years. They allow speakers of mutually unintelligible Chinese varieties to communicate with each other through writing. In 1956, the government introduced [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified characters]], which have supplanted the older [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional characters]] in mainland China. Chinese characters are [[Romanization|romanized]] using the [[Pinyin|Pinyin system]]. Tibetan uses an [[Tibetan alphabet|alphabet]] based on an [[Brahmic scripts|Indic script]]. Uyghur is most commonly written in [[Persian alphabet]]-based [[Uyghur Arabic alphabet]]. The [[Mongolian script|Mongolian script used in China]] and the [[Manchu alphabet|Manchu script]] are both derived from the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]]. [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] uses both an official [[Standard Zhuang|Latin alphabet script]] and a traditional [[Sawndip|Chinese character script]].
Urbanization.
[[File:China Top 10 Biggest Cities.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of the ten [[List of cities in China by population|largest cities]] in China (2010)]]
China has [[urbanisation|urbanized]] significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 60% in 2019. It is estimated that China's urban population will reach one billion by 2030, potentially equivalent to one-eighth of the world population.
China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million, including the 10 [[Megacity|megacities]](cities with a population of over 10 million) of [[Chongqing]], [[Shanghai]], [[Beijing]], [[Chengdu]], [[Harbin]], [[Guangzhou]], [[Tianjin]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Wuhan]], [[Shijiazhuang]] and [[Suzhou]]. Shanghai is China's [[List of cities in China by population|most populous urban area]] while Chongqing is its [[List of cities proper by population|largest city proper]]. By 2025, it is estimated that the country will be home to 221 cities with over a million inhabitants. The figures in the table below are from the 2017 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations (which includes suburban and rural populations). The large "[[floating population]]s" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult; the figures below include only long-term residents.
Education.
[[File:13 Peking University.jpg|alt=|thumb|Beijing's [[Peking University]], one of the [[Rankings of universities in China|top-ranked universities in China]]]]
Since 1986, compulsory education in China comprises [[primary school|primary]] and [[middle school|junior secondary school]], which together last for nine years. In 2010, about 82.5 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school. The [[Gaokao]], China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. In 2010, 27 percent of secondary school graduates are enrolled in higher education. This number increased significantly over the last years, reaching a tertiary school enrolment of 50 percent in 2018. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and [[tertiary education|tertiary]] level.
In February 2006, the government pledged to provide completely free nine-year education, including textbooks and fees. Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$250 billion in 2011. However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in [[Guizhou]], one of the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP per capita|poorest provinces in China]], only totalled ¥3,204. Free compulsory education in China consists of primary school and junior secondary school between the ages of 6 and 15. In 2011, around 81.4% of Chinese have received secondary education.
, 96% of the population over age 15 are literate. In 1949, only 20% of the population could read, compared to 65.5% thirty years later. In 2009, Chinese students from [[Shanghai]] achieved the world's best results in mathematics, science and literacy, as tested by the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (PISA), a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance. Despite the high results, Chinese education has also faced [[Criticism of education in China|both native and international criticism]] for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas.
As of 2020, China had the world's second-highest [[Rankings of universities in China|number of top universities]]. Currently, China trails only the United States in terms of representation on lists of top 200 universities according to the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]] (ARWU). China is home to the two best universities ([[Tsinghua University]] and [[Peking University]]) in the whole [[Asia]]-[[Oceania]] region and [[emerging countries]] according to the [[Times Higher Education World University Rankings]]. Both are members of the [[C9 League]], an alliance of elite [[Chinese universities]] offering comprehensive and leading education.
Health.
[[File:China Human Dev SVG.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Chart showing the rise of China's [[Human Development Index]] from 1970 to 2010]]
The [[National Health and Family Planning Commission]], together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the Chinese population. An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. At that time, the Communist Party started the [[Patriotic Health Campaign]], which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]] and [[scarlet fever]], which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign. After [[Deng Xiaoping]] began instituting [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the People's Communes. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a 3-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion. By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage. In 2011, China was estimated to be the world's third-largest supplier of [[pharmaceuticals]], but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of [[counterfeit medications]].
, the average life expectancy at birth in China is 76 years, and the [[infant mortality]] rate is 7 per thousand. Both have improved significantly since the 1950s. Rates of [[Stunted growth|stunting]], a condition caused by [[malnutrition]], have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010. Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by [[Air pollution in China|widespread air pollution]], hundreds of millions of [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smokers]], and an increase in [[obesity]] among urban youths. China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years, such as the 2003 outbreak of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], although this has since been largely contained. In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.
The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] was first identified in [[Wuhan]] in December 2019. Despite this, there is no convincing scientific evidence on the virus's origin, and further studies are being carried out around the world on a possible origin for the virus. The Chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the epidemic and accused of concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic.
Religion.
[[File:Distribution of religions in China.png|thumb|300px| ]]
The government of the People's Republic of China officially espouses [[State atheism#China|state atheism]], and has conducted [[Antireligious campaigns in China|antireligious campaigns]] to this end. Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the [[State Administration for Religious Affairs]]. [[Freedom of religion]] is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.
Over the millennia, Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The "[[three teachings]]", including [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Buddhism]] ([[Chinese Buddhism]]), historically have a significant role in shaping Chinese culture, enriching a [[Chinese theology|theological and spiritual framework]] which harks back to the early [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]]. Chinese popular or folk religion, which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions, consists in allegiance to the "[[shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]" (), a character that signifies the "[[Chinese gods and immortals|energies of generation]]", who can be [[deity|deities]] of the environment or [[progenitor|ancestral principles]] of human groups, concepts of civility, [[culture hero]]es, many of whom feature in [[Chinese mythology]] and history. Among the most popular [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] are those of [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] (goddess of the seas), [[Yellow Emperor|Huangdi]] (one of the two [[Yan Huang Zisun|divine patriarchs]] of the Chinese race), [[Guandi]] (god of war and business), [[Caishen]] (god of prosperity and richness), [[Pangu]] and many others. China is home to many of the [[list of statues by height|world's tallest religious statues]], including the tallest of all, the [[Spring Temple Buddha]] in [[Henan]].
Clear data on religious affiliation in China is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of "religion" and the unorganized, diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between [[three teachings]] religions and local folk religious practice. A 2015 poll conducted by [[WIN/GIA|Gallup International]] found that 61% of Chinese people self-identified as "convinced atheist", though it is worthwhile to note that Chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as [[nontheism|non-theistic]] and [[humanistic]] religions, since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being. According to a 2014 study, approximately 74% are either non-religious or practise Chinese folk belief, 16% are Buddhists, 2% are Christians, 1% are Muslims, and 8% adhere to other religions including [[Taoists]] and [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk salvationism]]. In addition to Han people's local religious practices, there are also various [[ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minority groups in China]] who maintain their [[religion in China#Ethnic minorities' indigenous religions|traditional autochthone religions]]. The various folk religions today comprise 2–3% of the population, while Confucianism as a religious self-identification is common within the intellectual class. Significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and the [[Islam in China|Islamic religion]] of the [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]], [[Kazakhs in China|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz in China|Kyrgyz]] and other peoples in Northwest China.
Culture.
[[File:Fenghuang old town.JPG|thumb|[[Fenghuang County]], an ancient town that harbors many architectural remains of Ming and Qing styles.]]
Since [[Ancient China|ancient times]], Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]]. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious [[imperial examination]]s, which have their origins in the [[Han dynasty]]. The [[Chinese literature|literary emphasis]] of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Classical Chinese poetry|poetry]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]] were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today.
[[File:Yellow Register Archives of the Ming Dynasty, Nanjing (flickr 1559896574).jpg|thumb|left|A [[Moon gate]] in a Chinese garden.]]
The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]". Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like [[Peking opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time. Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.
Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of [[Chinese nationalism]] and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival, and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.
Tourism in China.

Chinese literature is based on the literature of the [[Zhou dynasty]]. Concepts covered within the [[Chinese classic texts]] present a wide range of [[Hundred Schools of Thought|thoughts]] and subjects including [[Chinese calendar|calendar]], [[List of Chinese military texts|military]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], [[Chinese herbology|herbology]], [[Chinese geography|geography]] and many others. Some of the most important early texts include the "[[I Ching]]" and the "[[Classic of History|Shujing]]" within the [[Four Books and Five Classics]] which served as the Confucian authoritative books for the state-sponsored curriculum in dynastic era. Inherited from the "[[Classic of Poetry]]", [[classical Chinese poetry]] developed to its [[floruit]] during the Tang dynasty. [[Li Bai]] and [[Du Fu]] opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. [[Chinese historiography]] began with the "[[Shiji]]", the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the [[Twenty-Four Histories]], which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with [[Chinese mythology]] and [[Chinese folklore|folklore]]. Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the [[Ming dynasty]], Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and [[gods and demons fiction]]s as represented by the [[Four Great Classical Novels]] which include "[[Water Margin]]", "[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]", "[[Journey to the West]]" and "[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]". Along with the [[wuxia]] fictions of [[Jin Yong]] and [[Liang Yusheng]], it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]].
In the wake of the [[New Culture Movement]] after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with [[written vernacular Chinese]] for ordinary citizens. [[Hu Shih]] and [[Lu Xun]] were pioneers in modern literature. Various literary genres, such as [[misty poetry]], [[scar literature]], [[young adult fiction]] and the [[xungen movement|xungen literature]], which is influenced by [[magic realism]], emerged following the Cultural Revolution. [[Mo Yan]], a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.

Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the "Eight Major Cuisines", including [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]], [[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese]], [[Jiangsu cuisine|Jiangsu]], [[Shandong cuisine|Shandong]], [[Fujian cuisine|Fujian]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]], [[Anhui cuisine|Anhui]], and [[Zhejiang cuisine|Zhejiang]] cuisines. All of them are featured by the precise skills of shaping, heating, and flavoring. Chinese cuisine is also known for its width of [[Chinese cooking techniques|cooking methods]] and ingredients, as well as [[Chinese food therapy|food therapy]] that is emphasized by [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. Generally, China's staple food is rice in the south, wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. The diet of the common people in pre-modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables, with meat reserved for special occasions. And the bean products, such as [[tofu]] and [[soy milk]], remain as a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption. While pork dominates the meat market, there is also the vegetarian [[Buddhist cuisine]] and the pork-free [[Chinese Islamic cuisine]]. Southern cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables; it differs in many respects from the wheat-based diets across dry northern China. Numerous offshoots of Chinese food, such as [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong cuisine]] and [[American Chinese food]], have emerged in the nations that play host to the [[Chinese diaspora]].

Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes [[mandopop]] and [[cantopop]]. [[Chinese rap]], [[Chinese hip hop]] and [[Hong Kong hip hop]] have become popular in contemporary times.
