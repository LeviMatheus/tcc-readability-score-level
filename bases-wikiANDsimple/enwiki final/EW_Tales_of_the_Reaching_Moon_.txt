Tales of the Reaching Moon was a British fanzine dedicated to the fantasy world of Glorantha and producing material for fantasy role-playing games.
Publication history.
When UK fanzine "Pavic Tales", the first notable Glorantha fanzine, ended after issue #9 (Spring 1989), "Tales of the Reaching Moon" (20 issues, 1989-2002) from British fan organization Reaching Moon Megacorp was the next major fanzine for Glorantha. Reaching Moon Megacorp closed with the publication of "Tales of the Reaching Moon" #20 (2002).
The editor, David Hall, published 20 issues from 1989 to 2002 (2/yr until 1994, then annually). The magazine was originally published with a monochrome cover but had a full colour cover from issue 12 onwards. Most of the later issues had a central theme fleshed out through a variety of related articles by different authors. A list of issues with themes is given below:
The fanzine printed gaming material for a variety of rule-systems, including RuneQuest and King Arthur Pendragon. In addition to this it also had fiction, news and a Rumours section based on the format of the RuneQuest supplements.
