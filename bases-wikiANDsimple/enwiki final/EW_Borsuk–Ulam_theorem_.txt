In mathematics, the Borsuk–Ulam theorem states that every continuous function from an "n"-sphere into Euclidean "n"-space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.
Formally: if formula_1 is continuous then there exists an formula_2 such that: formula_3.
The case formula_4 can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the Earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously in space.
The case formula_5 is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures, assuming that both parameters vary continuously in space.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions. Recall that formula_6 is the "n"-sphere and formula_7 is the "n"-ball:
History.
According to , the first historical mention of the statement of the Borsuk–Ulam theorem appears in . The first proof was given by , where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Stanislaw Ulam. Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by .
Equivalent statements.
The following statements are equivalent to the Borsuk–Ulam theorem.
With odd functions.
A function formula_16 is called "odd" (aka "antipodal" or "antipode-preserving") if for every formula_17: formula_18.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an "n"-sphere into Euclidean "n"-space has a zero. PROOF: 
With retractions.
Define a "retraction" as a function formula_25 The Borsuk–Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.
Proof: If the theorem is correct, then every continuous odd function from formula_6 must include 0 in its range. However, formula_27 so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is formula_12.
Conversely, if it is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function formula_29 with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function formula_30 by:
since formula_16 has no zeroes, formula_33 is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.
Proofs.
1-dimensional case.
The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT).
Let formula_16 be an odd real-valued continuous function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary formula_17. If formula_10 then we are done. Otherwise, without loss of generality, formula_37 But formula_38 Hence, by the IVT, there is a point formula_39 between formula_17 and formula_41 at which formula_42.
General case - algebraic topology proof.
Assume that formula_30 is an odd continuous function with formula_44 (the case formula_45 is treated above, the case formula_46 can be handled using basic covering theory). By passing to orbits under the antipodal action, we then get an induced continuous function formula_47 between real projective spaces, which induces an isomorphism on fundamental groups. By the Hurewicz theorem, the induced ring homomorphism on cohomology with formula_48 coefficients [where formula_48 denotes the field with two elements], 
sends formula_51 to formula_52. But then we get that formula_53 is sent to formula_54, a contradiction.
One can also show the stronger statement that any odd map formula_55 has odd degree and then deduce the theorem from this result.
General case - combinatorial proof.
The Borsuk–Ulam theorem can be proved from Tucker's lemma.
Let formula_8 be a continuous odd function. Because "g" is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous. Therefore, for every formula_57, there is a formula_58 such that, for every two points of formula_59 which are within formula_60 of each other, their images under "g" are within formula_61 of each other.
Define a triangulation of formula_59 with edges of length at most formula_60. Label each vertex formula_64 of the triangulation with a label formula_65 in the following way:
Because "g" is odd, the labeling is also odd: formula_68. Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices formula_69 with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are formula_70. By the definition of "l", this means that in both formula_71 and formula_72, coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate: in formula_71 this coordinate is positive while in formula_72 it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between formula_71 and formula_72 is at most formula_61, so in particular formula_78 (since formula_79 and formula_80 have opposite signs) and so formula_81. But since the largest coordinate of formula_71 is coordinate #1, this means that formula_83 for each formula_84. So formula_85, where formula_86 is some constant depending on formula_87 and the norm formula_88 which you have chosen.
The above is true for every formula_57; since formula_59 is compact there must hence be a point "u" in which formula_91.
Equivalent results.
Above we showed how to prove the Borsuk–Ulam theorem from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from the Borsuk–Ulam theorem. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.
