Wulfstan of Hedeby was a late ninth century traveller and trader. His travel accounts, as well as those of another trader, Ohthere of HÃ¥logaland, were included in Alfred the Great's translation of Orosius' "Histories". It is unclear if Wulfstan was English or indeed if he was from Hedeby, in today's northern Germany near the city of Schleswig.
According to this account, Wulfstan undertook a journey by sea from Hedeby to the Prussian trading centre of Truso around the year 880. He names the lands the coasts he passes.
This may be the earliest recorded use of the word "Denmark" ("Danemearcan"). The text of Wulfstan is also one of the earliest attestments of unique traditions and customs of Western Balts - Prussians, called "Estum", and their land called Witland in his text. The purpose of this travel remains unclear, one of the hypothesis is that King Alfred was interested in having allies against vikings and therefore looked at Prussians - Aestii as a potential ally.
