Irreducible complexity (IC) is the argument that certain biological systems cannot have evolved by successive small modifications to pre-existing functional systems through natural selection, because no less complex system would function. Irreducible complexity has become central to the creationist concept of intelligent design, but the scientific community, which regards intelligent design as pseudoscience, rejects the concept of irreducible complexity. Irreducible complexity is one of two main arguments used by intelligent-design proponents, alongside specified complexity.
Creation science presented the theological argument from design with assertions that evolution could not explain complex molecular mechanisms, and in 1993 Michael Behe, a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University, presented these arguments in a revised version of the school textbook "Of Pandas and People". In his 1996 book "Darwin's Black Box" he called this concept "irreducible complexity" and said it made evolution through natural selection of random mutations impossible. This was based on the mistaken assumption that evolution relies on improvement of existing functions, ignoring how complex adaptations originate from changes in function, and disregarding published research. Evolutionary biologists have published rebuttals showing how systems discussed by Behe can evolve, and examples documented through comparative genomics show that complex molecular systems are formed by the addition of components as revealed by different temporal origins of their proteins.
In the 2005 "Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District" trial, Behe gave testimony on the subject of irreducible complexity. The court found that "Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity has been refuted in peer-reviewed research papers and has been rejected by the scientific community at large."
Definitions.
Michael Behe defined irreducible complexity in natural selection in terms of well-matched parts in his 1996 book "Darwin's Black Box":
... a single system which is composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, and where the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning.
A second definition given by Behe in 2000 (his "evolutionary definition") states:
An irreducibly complex evolutionary pathway is one that contains one or more unselected steps (that is, one or more necessary-but-unselected mutations). The degree of irreducible complexity is the number of unselected steps in the pathway.
Intelligent-design advocate William A. Dembski assumed an "original function" in his 2002 definition:
A system performing a given basic function is irreducibly complex if it includes a set of well-matched, mutually interacting, nonarbitrarily individuated parts such that each part in the set is indispensable to maintaining the system's basic, and therefore original, function. The set of these indispensable parts is known as the irreducible core of the system.
History.
Forerunners.
The argument from irreducible complexity is a descendant of the teleological argument for God (the argument from design or from complexity). This states that complex functionality in the natural world which looks designed is evidence of an intelligent creator. William Paley famously argued, in his 1802 watchmaker analogy, that complexity in nature implies a God for the same reason that the existence of a watch implies the existence of a watchmaker. This argument has a long history, and one can trace it back at least as far as Cicero's "De Natura Deorum" ii.34, written in 45 BC.
Up to the 18th century.
Galen (1st and 2nd centuries AD) wrote about the large number of parts of the body and their relationships, which observation was cited as evidence for creation. The idea that the interdependence between parts would have implications for the origins of living things was raised by writers starting with [[Pierre Gassendi]] in the mid-17th century and by [[John Wilkins]] (1614-1672), who wrote (citing Galen), "Now to imagine, that all these things, according to their several kinds, could be brought into this regular frame and order, to which such an infinite number of Intentions are required, without the contrivance of some wise Agent, must needs be irrational in the highest degree."
 In the late 17th-century, [[Thomas Burnet]] referred to "a multitude of pieces aptly joyn'd" to argue against the [[eternity]] of life. In the early 18th century, [[Nicolas Malebranche]] wrote "An organized body contains an infinity of parts that mutually depend upon one another in relation to particular ends, all of which must be actually formed in order to work as a whole", arguing in favor of [[preformation]], rather than [[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]], of the individual; and a similar argument about the origins of the individual was made by other 18th-century students of natural history. In his 1790 book, "[[The Critique of Judgment#Teleology|The Critique of Judgment]]", [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] is said by Guyer to argue that "we cannot conceive how a whole that comes into being only gradually from its parts can nevertheless be the cause of the properties of those parts".
19th century.
Chapter XV of Paley's "Natural Theology" discusses at length what he called "relations" of parts of living things as an indication of their design.
[[Georges Cuvier]] applied his principle of the "correlation of parts" to describe an animal from fragmentary remains. For Cuvier, this related to another principle of his, the "conditions of existence", which excluded the possibility of [[transmutation of species]].
While he did not originate the term, [[Charles Darwin]] identified the argument as a possible way to falsify a prediction of the theory of evolution at the outset. In "[[The Origin of Species]]" (1859), he wrote, "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case." Darwin's theory of evolution challenges the teleological argument by postulating an alternative explanation to that of an intelligent designer—namely, evolution by natural selection. By showing how simple unintelligent forces can ratchet up designs of extraordinary complexity without invoking outside design, Darwin showed that an intelligent designer was not the necessary conclusion to draw from complexity in nature. The argument from irreducible complexity attempts to demonstrate that certain biological features cannot be purely the product of Darwinian evolution.
In the late 19th century, in a dispute between supporters of the adequacy of [[natural selection]] and those who held for [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]], one of the arguments made repeatedly by [[Herbert Spencer]], and followed by others, depended on what Spencer referred to as "co-adaptation" of "co-operative" parts, as in: "We come now to Professor [[August Weismann|Weismann]]'s endeavour to disprove my second thesis — that it is impossible to explain by natural selection alone the co-adaptation of co-operative parts. It is thirty years since this was set forth in "The Principles of Biology." In §166, I instanced the enormous horns of the extinct [[Irish elk]], and contended that in this and in kindred cases, where for the efficient use of some one enlarged part many other parts have to be simultaneously enlarged, it is out of the question to suppose that they can have all spontaneously varied in the required proportions." Darwin responded to Spencer's objections in chapter XXV of "[[The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication]]" (1868). The history of this concept in the dispute has been characterized: "An older and more religious tradition of idealist thinkers were committed to the explanation of complex adaptive contrivances by intelligent design. ... Another line of thinkers, unified by the recurrent publications of Herbert Spencer, also saw [[co-adaptation]] as a composed, irreducible whole, but sought to explain it by the inheritance of acquired characteristics."
[[St. George Jackson Mivart]] raised the objection to natural selection that "Complex and simultaneous co-ordinations ... until so far developed as to effect the requisite junctions, are useless" which "amounts to the concept of "irreducible complexity" as defined by ... Michael Behe".
20th century.
[[Hermann Joseph Muller|Hermann Muller]], in the early 20th century, discussed a concept similar to irreducible complexity. However, far from seeing this as a problem for evolution, he described the "interlocking" of biological features as a consequence to be expected of evolution, which would lead to irreversibility of some evolutionary changes. He wrote, "Being thus finally woven, as it were, into the most intimate fabric of the organism, the once novel character can no longer be withdrawn with impunity, and may have become vitally necessary."
In 1974 the [[young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]] [[Henry M. Morris]] introduced a similar concept in his book "Scientific Creationism", in which he wrote; "This issue can actually be attacked quantitatively, using simple principles of mathematical probability. The problem is simply whether a complex system, in which many components function unitedly together, and in which each component is uniquely necessary to the efficient functioning of the whole, could ever arise by random processes."
In 1975 [[Thomas H. Frazzetta]] published a book-length study of a concept similar to irreducible complexity, explained by gradual, step-wise, non-teleological evolution. Frazzetta wrote: "A complex adaptation is one constructed of "several" components that must blend together operationally to make the adaptation "work". It is analogous to a machine whose performance depends upon careful cooperation among its parts. In the case of the machine, no single part can greatly be altered without changing the performance of the entire machine." The machine that he chose as an analog is the [[Peaucellier–Lipkin linkage]], and one biological system given extended description was the jaw apparatus of a python. The conclusion of this investigation, rather than that evolution of a complex adaptation was impossible, "awed by the adaptations of living things, to be stunned by their complexity and suitability", was "to accept the inescapable but not humiliating fact that much of mankind can be seen in a tree or a lizard."
In 1981, Ariel Roth, in defense of the [[creation science|creation-science]] position in the trial "[[McLean v. Arkansas]]", said of "complex integrated structures": "This system would not be functional until all the parts were there ... How did these parts survive during evolution ...?"
In 1985 [[Graham Cairns-Smith|Cairns-Smith]] wrote of "interlocking": "How can a complex collaboration between components evolve in small steps?" and used the analogy of the scaffolding called [[centring|centering]] - used to [[arch#Construction|build an arch]] then removed afterwards: "Surely there was 'scaffolding'. Before the multitudinous components of present biochemistry could come to lean together "they had to lean on something else."" However, neither Muller or Cairns-Smith claimed their ideas as evidence of something supernatural.
An essay in support of [[creationism]] published in 1994 referred to bacterial [[flagella]] as showing "multiple, integrated components", where "nothing about them works unless every one of their complexly fashioned and integrated components are in place". The author asked the reader to "imagine the effects of natural selection on those organisms that fortuitously evolved the flagella ... without the concommitant control mechanisms".
An early concept of irreducibly complex systems comes from [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901-1972), an Austrian biologist. He believed that complex systems must be examined as complete, [[irreducibility|irreducible]] systems in order to fully understand how they work. He extended his work on biological complexity into a general theory of systems in a book titled "[[systems theory|General Systems Theory]]".
After [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published the structure of [[DNA]] in the early 1950s, General Systems Theory lost many of its adherents in the physical and biological sciences.
However, [[systems theory]] remained popular in the social sciences long after its demise in the physical and biological sciences.
Origins.
[[File:Darwinsblackbox.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Michael Behe]]'s controversial book "[[Darwin's Black Box]]" popularized the concept of irreducible complexity.]]
[[Michael Behe]] developed his ideas on the concept around 1992, in the early days of the '[[wedge strategy|wedge movement]]', and first presented his ideas about "irreducible complexity" in June 1993 when the "Johnson-Behe cadre of scholars" met at Pajaro Dunes in California. He set out his ideas in the second edition of "[[Of Pandas and People]]" published in 1993, extensively revising Chapter 6 "Biochemical Similarities" with new sections on the complex mechanism of blood clotting and on the origin of proteins.
He first used the term "irreducible complexity" in his 1996 book "[[Darwin's Black Box]]", to refer to certain complex biochemical [[cell (biology)|cellular]] systems. He posits that evolutionary mechanisms cannot explain the development of such "irreducibly complex" systems. Notably, Behe credits philosopher [[William Paley]] for the original concept (alone among the predecessors) and suggests that his application of the concept to biological systems is entirely original.
Intelligent design advocates argue that irreducibly complex systems must have been deliberately engineered by some form of [[intelligent designer|intelligence]].
In 2001, [[Michael Behe]] wrote: "[T]here is an asymmetry between my current definition of irreducible complexity and the task facing natural selection. I hope to repair this defect in future work." Behe specifically explained that the "current definition puts the focus on removing a part from an already functioning system", but the "difficult task facing Darwinian evolution, however, would not be to remove parts from sophisticated pre-existing systems; it would be to bring together components to make a new system in the first place". In the 2005 "[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]" trial, Behe testified under oath that he "did not judge [the asymmetry] serious enough to [have revised the book] yet."
Behe additionally testified that the presence of irreducible complexity in organisms would not rule out the involvement of evolutionary mechanisms in the development of organic life. He further testified that he knew of no earlier "peer reviewed articles in scientific journals discussing the intelligent design of the blood clotting cascade," but that there were "probably a large number of peer reviewed articles in science journals that demonstrate that the blood clotting system is indeed a purposeful arrangement of parts of great complexity and sophistication." (The judge ruled that "intelligent design is not science and is essentially religious in nature".)
According to the theory of evolution, genetic variations occur without specific design or intent. The environment "selects" the variants that have the highest fitness, which are then passed on to the next generation of organisms. Change occurs by the gradual operation of natural forces over time, perhaps slowly, perhaps more quickly (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]). This process is able to [[adaptation|adapt]] complex structures from simpler beginnings, or convert complex structures from one function to another (see [[spandrel (biology)|spandrel]]). Most intelligent design advocates accept that evolution occurs through mutation and natural selection at the "[[microevolution|micro level]]", such as changing the relative frequency of various beak lengths in finches, but assert that it cannot account for irreducible complexity, because none of the parts of an irreducible system would be functional or advantageous until the entire system is in place.
The mousetrap example.
[[File:Mausefalle 300px.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Michael Behe]] believes that many aspects of life show evidence of design, using the [[mousetrap]] in an analogy disputed by others.]]
Behe uses the mousetrap as an illustrative example of this concept. A mousetrap consists of five interacting pieces: the base, the catch, the spring, the hammer, and the hold-down bar. All of these must be in place for the mousetrap to work, as the removal of any one piece destroys the function of the mousetrap. Likewise, he asserts that biological systems require multiple parts working together in order to function. Intelligent design advocates claim that natural selection could not create from scratch those systems for which science is currently unable to find a viable evolutionary pathway of successive, slight modifications, because the selectable function is only present when all parts are assembled.
In his 2008 book "[[Only A Theory]]", biologist [[Kenneth R. Miller]] challenges Behe's claim that the mousetrap is irreducibly complex. Miller observes that various subsets of the five components can be devised to form cooperative units, ones that have different functions from the mousetrap and so, in biological terms, could form functional [[spandrel (biology)|spandrels]] before being adapted to the new function of catching mice. In an example taken from his high school experience, Miller recalls that one of his classmates...struck upon the brilliant idea of using an old, broken mousetrap as a spitball catapult, and it worked brilliantly... It had worked perfectly as something other than a mousetrap... my rowdy friend had pulled a couple of parts --probably the hold-down bar and catch-- off the trap to make it easier to conceal and more effective as a catapult... [leaving] the base, the spring, and the hammer. Not much of a mousetrap, but a helluva spitball launcher... I realized why [Behe's] mousetrap analogy had bothered me. It was wrong. The mousetrap is not irreducibly complex after all.
Other systems identified by Miller that include mousetrap components include the following:
The point of the reduction is that - in biology - most or all of the components were already at hand, by the time it became necessary to build a mousetrap. As such, it required far fewer steps to develop a mousetrap than to design all the components from scratch.
Thus, the development of the mousetrap, said to consist of five different parts which had no function on their own, has been reduced to one step: the assembly from parts that are already present, performing other functions.
Consequences.
Supporters of intelligent design argue that anything less than the complete form of such a system or organ would not work at all, or would in fact be a "detriment" to the organism, and would therefore never survive the process of natural selection. Although they accept that some complex systems and organs "can" be explained by evolution, they claim that organs and biological features which are "irreducibly complex" cannot be explained by current models, and that an intelligent designer must have created life or guided its evolution. Accordingly, the debate on irreducible complexity concerns two questions: whether irreducible complexity can be found in nature, and what significance it would have if it did exist in nature.
Behe's original examples of irreducibly complex mechanisms included the bacterial [[flagellum]] of "[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]", [[coagulation|the blood clotting cascade]], [[cilia]], and the [[adaptive immune system]].
Behe argues that organs and biological features which are irreducibly complex cannot be wholly explained by current models of [[evolution]]. In explicating his definition of "irreducible complexity" he notes that:
An irreducibly complex system cannot be produced directly (that is, by continuously improving the initial function, which continues to work by the same mechanism) by slight, successive modifications of a precursor system, because any precursor to an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional.
Irreducible complexity is not an argument that evolution does not occur, but rather an argument that it is "incomplete". In the last chapter of "[[Darwin's Black Box]]", Behe goes on to explain his view that irreducible complexity is evidence for [[intelligent design]]. Mainstream critics, however, argue that irreducible complexity, as defined by Behe, can be generated by known evolutionary mechanisms. Behe's claim that no scientific literature adequately modeled the origins of biochemical systems through evolutionary mechanisms has been challenged by [[TalkOrigins Archive|TalkOrigins]]. The judge in the "Dover" trial wrote "By defining irreducible complexity in the way that he has, Professor Behe attempts to exclude the phenomenon of [[exaptation]] by definitional fiat, ignoring as he does so abundant evidence which refutes his argument. Notably, the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|NAS]] has rejected Professor Behe's claim for irreducible complexity..."
Stated examples.
Behe and others have suggested a number of biological features that they believed to be irreducibly complex.
Blood clotting cascade.
The process of blood clotting or [[coagulation]] cascade in vertebrates is a complex biological pathway which is given as an example of apparent irreducible complexity.
The irreducible complexity argument assumes that the necessary parts of a system have always been necessary, and therefore could not have been added sequentially. However, in evolution, something which is at first merely advantageous can later become necessary. [[Natural selection]] can lead to complex biochemical systems being built up from simpler systems, or to existing functional systems being recombined as a new system with a different function. For example, one of the clotting factors that Behe listed as a part of the clotting cascade ([[Factor XII]], also called Hageman factor) was later found to be absent in whales, demonstrating that it is not essential for a clotting system. Many purportedly irreducible structures can be found in other organisms as much simpler systems that utilize fewer parts. These systems, in turn, may have had even simpler precursors that are now extinct. Behe has responded to critics of his clotting cascade arguments by suggesting that [[homology (biology)|homology]] is evidence for evolution, but not for natural selection.
The "improbability argument" also misrepresents natural selection. It is correct to say that a set of simultaneous mutations that form a complex protein structure is so unlikely as to be unfeasible, but that is not what Darwin advocated. His explanation is based on small accumulated changes that take place without a final goal. Each step must be advantageous in its own right, although biologists may not yet understand the reason behind all of them—for example, [[jawless fish]] accomplish blood clotting with just six proteins instead of the full ten.
Eye.
[[File:Stages in the evolution of the eye.png|thumb|300px|Stages in the evolution of the eye(a) A pigment spot(b) A simple pigment cup(c) The simple optic cup found in [[abalone]](d) The complex lensed eye of the marine snail and the octopus]]
The [[eye]] is frequently cited by intelligent design and creationism advocates as a purported example of irreducible complexity. Behe used the "development of the eye problem" as evidence for intelligent design in "Darwin's Black Box". Although Behe acknowledged that the evolution of the larger anatomical features of the eye have been well-explained, he pointed out that the complexity of the minute biochemical reactions required at a molecular level for light sensitivity still defies explanation. Creationist [[Jonathan Sarfati]] has described the eye as evolutionary biologists' "greatest challenge as an example of superb 'irreducible complexity' in God's creation", specifically pointing to the supposed "vast complexity" required for transparency.
In an often misquoted passage from "[[On the Origin of Species]]", [[Charles Darwin]] appears to acknowledge the eye's development as a difficulty for his theory. However, the quote in context shows that Darwin actually had a very good understanding of the evolution of the eye (see [[fallacy of quoting out of context]]). He notes that "to suppose that the eye ... could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree". Yet this observation was merely a [[procatalepsis|rhetorical device]] for Darwin. He goes on to explain that if gradual evolution of the eye could be shown to be possible, "the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection ... can hardly be considered real". He then proceeded to roughly map out a likely course for evolution using examples of gradually more complex eyes of various species.
[[File:Evolution eye.svg|thumb|left|200px|The eyes of vertebrates (left) and invertebrates such as the [[octopus]] (right) developed independently: vertebrates evolved an inverted [[retina]] with a [[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]] over their [[optic disc]], whereas octopuses avoided this with a non-inverted retina. (1 photo-receptors, 2 neural tissue, 3 optic nerve)]]
Since Darwin's day, the eye's ancestry has become much better understood. Although learning about the construction of ancient eyes through fossil evidence is problematic due to the soft tissues leaving no imprint or remains, genetic and comparative anatomical evidence has increasingly supported the idea of a common ancestry for all eyes.
Current evidence does suggest possible evolutionary lineages for the origins of the anatomical features of the eye. One likely chain of development is that the eyes originated as simple patches of [[photoreceptor cell]]s that could detect the presence or absence of light, but not its direction. When, via random mutation across the population, the photosensitive cells happened to have developed on a small depression, it endowed the organism with a better sense of the light's source. This small change gave the organism an advantage over those without the mutation. This genetic trait would then be "selected for" as those with the trait would have an increased chance of survival, and therefore progeny, over those without the trait. Individuals with deeper depressions would be able to discern changes in light over a wider field than those individuals with shallower depressions. As ever deeper depressions were advantageous to the organism, gradually, this depression would become a pit into which light would strike certain cells depending on its angle. The organism slowly gained increasingly precise visual information. And again, this gradual process continued as individuals having a slightly shrunken [[aperture]] of the eye had an advantage over those without the mutation as an aperture increases how [[collimated]] the light is at any one specific group of photoreceptors. As this trait developed, the eye became effectively a [[pinhole camera]] which allowed the organism to dimly make out shapes—the [[nautilus]] is a modern example of an animal with such an eye. Finally, via this same selection process, a protective layer of transparent cells over the aperture was differentiated into a crude [[lens (anatomy)|lens]], and the interior of the eye was filled with humours to assist in focusing images. In this way, eyes are recognized by modern biologists as actually a relatively unambiguous and simple structure to evolve, and many of the major developments of the eye's evolution are believed to have taken place over only a few million years, during the [[Cambrian explosion]]. Behe asserts that this is only an explanation of the gross anatomical steps, however, and not an explanation of the changes in discrete biochemical systems that would have needed to take place.
Behe maintains that the complexity of light sensitivity at the molecular level and the minute biochemical reactions required for those first "simple patches of photoreceptor[s]" still defies explanation, and that the proposed series of infinitesimal steps to get from patches of photoreceptors to a fully functional eye would actually be considered great, complex leaps in evolution if viewed on the molecular scale. Other intelligent design proponents claim that the evolution of the entire visual system would be difficult rather than the eye alone.
Flagella.
The [[flagella]] of certain bacteria constitute a [[molecular motor]] requiring the interaction of about 40 different protein parts. Behe presents this as a prime example of an irreducibly complex structure defined as "a single system composed of several well-matched, interacting parts that contribute to the basic function, wherein the removal of any one of the parts causes the system to effectively cease functioning", and argues that since "an irreducibly complex system that is missing a part is by definition nonfunctional", it could not have evolved gradually through [[natural selection]].
Reducible complexity. In contrast to Behe's claims, many proteins can be deleted or mutated and the flagellum still works, even though sometimes at reduced efficiency. In fact, the composition of flagella is surprisingly diverse across bacteria with many proteins only found in some species but not others. Hence the flagellar apparatus is clearly very flexible in evolutionary terms and perfectly able to lose or gain protein components. Further studies have shown that, contrary to claims of "irreducible complexity", flagella and related [[protein targeting|protein transport mechanisms]] show evidence of evolution through Darwinian processes, providing case studies in how complex systems can evolve from simpler components. Multiple processes were involved in the evolution of the flagellum, including [[horizontal gene transfer]].
Evolution from type three secretion systems. Scientists regard this argument as having been disproved in the light of research dating back to 1996 as well as more recent findings. They point out that the basal body of the flagella has been found to be similar to the [[Type three secretion system|Type III secretion system]] (TTSS), a needle-like structure that pathogenic germs such as "[[Salmonella]]" and "[[Yersinia pestis]]" use to inject [[toxin]]s into living [[eucaryote]] cells. The needle's base has ten elements in common with the flagellum, but it is missing forty of the proteins that make a flagellum work. The TTSS system negates Behe's claim that taking away any one of the flagellum's parts would prevent the system from functioning. On this basis, [[Kenneth R. Miller|Kenneth Miller]] notes that, "The parts of this supposedly irreducibly complex system actually have functions of their own." Studies have also shown that similar parts of the flagellum in different bacterial species can have different functions despite showing evidence of common descent, and that certain parts of the flagellum can be removed without completely eliminating its functionality.
Dembski has argued that phylogenetically, the TTSS is found in a narrow range of bacteria which makes it seem to him to be a late innovation, whereas flagella are widespread throughout many bacterial groups, and he argues that it was an early innovation. Against Dembski's argument, different flagella use completely different mechanisms, and publications show a plausible path in which bacterial flagella could have evolved from a secretion system.
Cilium motion.
The [[cilium]] construction of [[axoneme]] microtubules movement by the sliding of [[dynein]] protein was cited by Behe as an example of irreducible complexity. He further said that the advances in knowledge in the subsequent 10 years had shown that the complexity of [[intraflagellar transport]] for two hundred components cilium and many other cellular structures is substantially greater than was known earlier.
Bombardier beetle's defense mechanism.
The [[bombardier beetle]] is able to defend itself by directing a spray of hot fluid at an attacker. The mechanism involves a system for mixing [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], which react violently to attain a temperature near boiling point, and in some species a nozzle which allows the spray to be directed accurately in any direction.
The unique combination of features of the bombardier beetle's defense mechanism—strongly exothermic reactions, boiling-hot fluids, and explosive release—have been claimed by [[creationists]] and proponents of intelligent design to be examples of irreducible complexity. Biologists such as the taxonomist Mark Isaak note however that step-by-step evolution of the mechanism could readily have occurred. In particular, quinones are precursors to [[sclerotin]], used to harden the skeleton of many insects, while peroxide is a common by-product of metabolism.
Response of the scientific community.
Like intelligent design, the concept it seeks to support, irreducible complexity has failed to gain any notable acceptance within the [[scientific community]].
Reducibility of "irreducible" systems.
Researchers have proposed potentially viable evolutionary pathways for allegedly irreducibly complex systems such as blood clotting, the immune system and the flagellum - the three examples Behe proposed. John H. McDonald even showed his example of a mousetrap to be reducible. If irreducible complexity is an insurmountable obstacle to evolution, it should not be possible to conceive of such pathways.
Niall Shanks and Karl H. Joplin, both of [[East Tennessee State University]], have shown that systems satisfying Behe's characterization of irreducible biochemical complexity can arise naturally and spontaneously as the result of self-organizing chemical processes. They also assert that what evolved biochemical and molecular systems actually exhibit is "redundant complexity"—a kind of complexity that is the product of an evolved biochemical process. They claim that Behe overestimated the significance of irreducible complexity because of his simple, linear view of biochemical reactions, resulting in his taking snapshots of selective features of biological systems, structures, and processes, while ignoring the redundant complexity of the context in which those features are naturally embedded. They also criticized his over-reliance of overly simplistic metaphors, such as his mousetrap.
A computer model of the co-evolution of proteins binding to DNA in the peer-reviewed journal "[[Nucleic Acids Research]]" consisted of several parts (DNA binders and DNA binding sites) which contribute to the basic function; removal of either one leads immediately to the death of the organism. This model fits the definition of irreducible complexity exactly, yet it evolves. (The program can be run from Ev program.)
In addition, research published in the peer-reviewed journal [[Nature (journal)|"Nature"]] has shown that computer simulations of evolution demonstrate that it is possible for complex features to evolve naturally.
One can compare a mousetrap with a cat in this context. Both normally function so as to control the mouse population. The cat has many parts that can be removed leaving it still functional; for example, its tail can be bobbed, or it can lose an ear in a fight. Comparing the cat and the mousetrap, then, one sees that the mousetrap (which is not alive) offers better evidence, in terms of irreducible complexity, for intelligent design than the cat. Even looking at the mousetrap analogy, several critics have described ways in which the parts of the mousetrap could have independent uses or could develop in stages, demonstrating that it is not irreducibly complex.
Moreover, even cases where removing a certain component in an organic system will cause the system to fail do not demonstrate that the system could not have been formed in a step-by-step, evolutionary process. By analogy, stone arches are irreducibly complex—if you remove any stone the arch will collapse—yet humans [[arch#Construction|build them]] easily enough, one stone at a time, by building over [[centring|centering]] that is removed afterward. Similarly, [[natural arch|naturally occurring arches]] of stone form by the weathering away of bits of stone from a large concretion that has formed previously.
Evolution can act to simplify as well as to complicate. This raises the possibility that seemingly irreducibly complex biological features may have been achieved with a period of increasing complexity, followed by a period of simplification.
A team led by [[Joseph Thornton (biologist)|Joseph Thornton]], assistant professor of biology at the [[University of Oregon]]'s Center for Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, using techniques for resurrecting ancient genes, reconstructed the evolution of an apparently irreducibly complex molecular system. The April 7, 2006 issue of "Science" published this research.
Irreducible complexity may not actually exist in nature, and the examples given by Behe and others may not in fact represent irreducible complexity, but can be explained in terms of simpler precursors. The theory of [[facilitated variation]] challenges irreducible complexity. [[Marc W. Kirschner]], a professor and chair of Department of Systems Biology at [[Harvard Medical School]], and [[John C. Gerhart]], a professor in Molecular and Cell Biology, [[University of California, Berkeley]], presented this theory in 2005. They describe how certain mutation and changes can cause apparent irreducible complexity. Thus, seemingly irreducibly complex structures are merely "very complex", or they are simply misunderstood or misrepresented.
Gradual adaptation to new functions.
The precursors of complex systems, when they are not useful in themselves, may be useful to perform other, unrelated functions. Evolutionary biologists argue that evolution often works in this kind of blind, haphazard manner in which the function of an early form is not necessarily the same as the function of the later form. The term used for this process is [[exaptation]]. The [[evolution of mammalian auditory ossicles|mammalian middle ear]] (derived from a jawbone) and the [[giant panda|panda]]'s thumb (derived from a wrist bone spur) provide classic examples. A 2006 article in "Nature" demonstrates intermediate states leading toward the development of the ear in a [[Devonian]] fish (about 360 million years ago). Furthermore, recent research shows that viruses play a heretofore unexpected role in evolution by mixing and matching genes from various hosts.
Arguments for irreducibility often assume that things started out the same way they ended up—as we see them now. However, that may not necessarily be the case. In the "Dover" trial an expert witness for the plaintiffs, Ken Miller, demonstrated this possibility using Behe's mousetrap analogy. By removing several parts, Miller made the object unusable as a mousetrap, but he pointed out that it was now a perfectly functional, if unstylish, [[tie clip]].
Methods by which irreducible complexity may evolve.
Irreducible complexity can be seen as equivalent to an "uncrossable valley" in a [[fitness landscape]]. A number of mathematical models of evolution have explored the circumstances under which such valleys can, nevertheless, be crossed.
Falsifiability and experimental evidence.
Some critics, such as [[Jerry Coyne]] (professor of [[evolutionary biology]] at the [[University of Chicago]]) and [[Eugenie Scott]] (a [[physical anthropology|physical anthropologist]] and former executive director of the [[National Center for Science Education]]) have argued that the concept of irreducible complexity and, more generally, [[intelligent design]] is not [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] and, therefore, not [[scientific]].
Behe argues that the theory that irreducibly complex systems could not have evolved can be falsified by an experiment where such systems are evolved. For example, he posits taking bacteria with no [[flagella|flagellum]] and imposing a selective pressure for mobility. If, after a few thousand generations, the bacteria evolved the bacterial flagellum, then Behe believes that this would refute his theory.
Other critics take a different approach, pointing to experimental evidence that they consider falsification of the argument for intelligent design from irreducible complexity. For example, [[Kenneth R. Miller|Kenneth Miller]] describes the lab work of Barry G. Hall on [[Escherichia coli|E. coli]] as showing that "Behe is wrong".
Other evidence that irreducible complexity is not a problem for evolution comes from the field of [[computer science]], which routinely uses computer analogues of the processes of evolution in order to automatically design complex solutions to problems. The results of such [[genetic algorithm]]s are frequently irreducibly complex since the process, like evolution, both removes non-essential components over time as well as adding new components. The removal of unused components with no essential function, like the natural process where rock underneath a [[natural arch]] is removed, can produce irreducibly complex structures without requiring the intervention of a designer. Researchers applying these algorithms automatically produce human-competitive designs—but no human designer is required.
Argument from ignorance.
Intelligent design proponents attribute to an intelligent designer those biological structures they believe are irreducibly complex and therefore they say a natural explanation is insufficient to account for them. However, critics view irreducible complexity as a special case of the "complexity indicates design" claim, and thus see it as an [[argument from ignorance]] and as a [[God of the gaps|God-of-the-gaps]] argument.
[[Eugenie Scott]] and [[Glenn Branch]] of the [[National Center for Science Education]] note that intelligent design arguments from irreducible complexity rest on the false assumption that a lack of knowledge of a natural explanation allows intelligent design proponents to assume an intelligent cause, when the proper response of scientists would be to say that we don't know, and further investigation is needed. Other critics describe Behe as saying that evolutionary explanations are not detailed enough to meet his standards, while at the same time presenting intelligent design as exempt from having to provide any positive evidence at all.
False dilemma.
Irreducible complexity is at its core an argument against evolution. If truly irreducible systems are found, the argument goes, then [[intelligent design]] must be the correct explanation for their existence. However, this conclusion is based on the assumption that current [[evolution]]ary theory and intelligent design are the only two valid models to explain life, a [[false dilemma]].
In the Dover trial.
While testifying during the 2005 "[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]" trial, Behe conceded that there are no peer-reviewed papers supporting his claims that complex [[molecular]] systems, like the bacterial flagellum, the blood-clotting cascade, and the immune system, were intelligently designed nor are there any peer-reviewed articles supporting his argument that certain complex molecular structures are "irreducibly complex."
In the final ruling of "Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District", Judge Jones specifically singled out Behe and irreducible complexity:
