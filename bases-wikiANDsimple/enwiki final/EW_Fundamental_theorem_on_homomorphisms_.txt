In abstract algebra, the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms, also known as the fundamental homomorphism theorem, relates the structure of two objects between which a homomorphism is given, and of the kernel and image of the homomorphism.
The homomorphism theorem is used to prove the isomorphism theorems.
Group theoretic version.
Given two groups "G" and "H" and a group homomorphism "f" : "G"→"H", let "K" be a normal subgroup in "G" and φ the natural surjective homomorphism "G"→"G"/"K" (where "G"/"K" is a quotient group). If "K" is a subset of ker("f") then there exists a unique homomorphism "h":"G"/"K"→"H" such that "f" = "h" φ.
In other words, the natural projection φ is universal among homomorphisms on "G" that map "K" to the identity element.
The situation is described by the following commutative diagram:
By setting "K" = ker("f") we immediately get the first isomorphism theorem.
We can write the statement of the fundamental theorem on homomorphisms of groups as
"Every homomorphic image of a group is isomorphic to a quotient group".

Similar theorems are valid for monoids, vector spaces, modules, and rings.
