A war of independence or independence war is a conflict occurring over a territory that has declared independence from some nation-state or ruling colonial power. Once the state that previously held the territory sends in military forces to assert its sovereignty or the native population clashes with the former occupier, a separatist rebellion has begun. If a new state is successfully established, the conflict is usually known as a 'War of Independence'.
