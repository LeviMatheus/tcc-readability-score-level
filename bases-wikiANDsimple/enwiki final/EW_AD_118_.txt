Year 118 (CXVIII) was a common year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 118th Year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 118th year of the 1st millennium, the 18th year of the 2nd century, and the 9th and pre-final year of the 110s decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Hadrianus and Fuscus (or, less frequently, year 871 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 118 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
