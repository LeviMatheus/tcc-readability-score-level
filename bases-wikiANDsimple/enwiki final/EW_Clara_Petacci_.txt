Clara Petacci, known as Claretta Petacci (; 28 February 1912 – 28 April 1945), was a mistress of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. She was killed during Mussolini's execution by Italian partisans, allegedly throwing herself on him in a vain attempt to protect him from the bullets.
Early life.
Daughter of Giuseppina Persichetti (1888–1962) and the physician Francesco Saverio Petacci (1883–1970), Clara Petacci was born into a privileged and religious family in Rome during 1912. Her father was physician of the Holy Apostolic Palaces and a supporter of fascism. A child when Mussolini rose to power, she idolised him from an early age. In 1926, when Violet Gibson attempted to assassinate the dictator, 14-year-old Petacci wrote to him commenting ‘O, Duce, why was I not with you?... Could I not have strangled that murderous woman?’
Relationship with Mussolini.
Petacci had a long-standing relationship with Mussolini while he was married to Rachele Mussolini. Petacci was 28 years younger than Mussolini. They met for the first time in 1933; in 1934 Petacci married Italian Air Force officer Riccardo Federici, but she parted ways with her husband when he was sent as Air Attaché to Tokyo in 1936.
Part of Petacci and Mussolini's correspondence is still the subject of a dispute with the National Archives, based on privacy.
Death.
On 27 April 1945, Mussolini and Petacci were captured by partisans while traveling with a convoy of Italian Social Republic members.
On 28 April, she and Mussolini were taken to Mezzegra and executed. On the following day, the bodies of Mussolini and Petacci were taken to Piazzale Loreto in Milan and hung upside down in front of an Esso petrol station. The bodies were photographed as a crowd vented their rage upon them.
