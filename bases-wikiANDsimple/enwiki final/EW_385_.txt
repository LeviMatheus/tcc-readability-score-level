Year 385 (CCCLXXXV) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Bauto (or, less frequently, year 1138 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 385 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
