Canonized Roman Catholic saints have been through a formal institutional process resulting in their canonization. There have been thousands of canonizations. (Pope John Paul II alone canonized 110 individuals, as well as many group canonizations such as 110 martyr saints of China, 103 Korean martyrs, 117 Vietnamese martyrs, the Mexican Martyrs, Spanish martyrs and French revolutionary martyrs. Note that 78 popes are considered saints.)
Among the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Communions, the numbers may be even higher, since there is no fixed process of "canonization" and each individual jurisdiction within the two Orthodox communions independently maintains parallel lists of saints that have only partial overlap. The Anglican Communion recognizes pre-Reformation saints, as does the United Methodist Church. Persons who have led lives of celebrated sanctity or missionary zeal are included in the Calendar of the Prayer Book "...without thereby enrolling or commending such persons as saints of the Church..." Similarly, any individuals commemorated in the Lutheran calendar of saints will be listed. Other denominations have their own Calendars of Saints they maintain.
