The Violin Sonata No. 5 in F major, Op. 24, is a violin sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It is often known as the Spring Sonata ("Frühlingssonate"), and was published in 1801. It was dedicated to Count Moritz von Fries, a patron to whom Beethoven also dedicated two other works of the same year—the String Quintet in C major, Op. 29 and the Violin Sonata No. 4—as well as his later Symphony No. 7 in A major.
Origin.
Beethoven initially intended to pair this piece with his Violin Sonata No. 4, Opus 23. As Joseph Szigeti noted, the two pieces complement each other in both key and character. This piece has a more lyrical quality while its intended pairing has a grabbing and agitated touch. However, the two were never published together and thus have different opus numbers. The reason for such a separation is unknown.
Structure.
The work is in four movements:
The "Scherzo" and its trio are particularly brief; the entire sonata takes approximately 22 minutes to perform. The name "Spring Sonata" was given to it after Beethoven's death.
The "Allegro" movement is featured in the stage show "Fame" and in the grade 8 syllabus of ABRSM's bowed strings exam from 2016 to 2019. It is also featured in the finale of the NBC show, "The Good Place".
While reviewing the cpo recording of composer Ferdinand Ries's violin sonatas Op. 8 No. 1, Op. 16 No. 2 and Op. 71, Jonathan Woolf commented that the Op. 8 No. 1 sonata was heavily inspired by this work.
