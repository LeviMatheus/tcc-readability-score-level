A Künstlerroman (; plural -ane), meaning "artist's novel" in English, is a narrative about an artist's growth to maturity. It could be classified as a sub-category of "Bildungsroman". According to Encyclopaedia Britannica, a Künstlerroman differs from a Bildungsroman upon its ending. Whereas a Künstlerroman concludes with a rejection of the everyday life, the hero of a Bildungsroman fantasizes of becoming an important artist figure, however, settles for being a common citizen by the end of the novel.
