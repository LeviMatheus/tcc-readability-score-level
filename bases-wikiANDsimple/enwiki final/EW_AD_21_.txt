AD 21 (XXI) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tiberius and Drusus (or, less frequently, year 774 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 21 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
