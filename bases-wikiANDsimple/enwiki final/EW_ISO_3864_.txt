Colours.
These are the colours specified in ISO Standard 3864-4 in RAL colour standard.

The corresponding American standard is ANSI Z535, which is incompatible with the ISO standard. ANSI Z535.1 divides "Warning (Signal Yellow)" into two colors: Yellow (Pantone 109) for 'caution' messages, and Orange (Pantone 151) for stronger 'warning' messages. Like ISO 3864, ANSI Z535 includes multiple sections: ANSI Z535.6-2006 defines an optional accompanying text in one or more languages.
ISO 3864 is extended by ISO 7010, which provides a set of symbols based on the principles and properties specified in ISO 3864.
