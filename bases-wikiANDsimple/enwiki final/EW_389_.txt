Year 389 (CCCLXXXIX) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Timasius and Promotus (or, less frequently, year 1142 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 389 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
