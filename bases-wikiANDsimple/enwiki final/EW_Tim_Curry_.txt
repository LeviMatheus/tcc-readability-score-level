Early life.
Curry was born in Grappenhall, Cheshire on 19 April 1946. His father, James Curry, a chaplain in the Royal Navy, died when Curry was 12 years old.
Curry spent most of his childhood in Plymouth, Devon. After his father's death from pneumonia in 1958, his family moved to South London. Curry went to boarding school and attended Kingswood School in Bath, Somerset. He developed into a talented boy soprano (treble). Deciding to concentrate on acting, Curry graduated from the University of Birmingham with a combined degree in English and Drama (BA Drama and Theatre Studies, 1968).
Acting career.
"Rocky Horror".
Curry's first full-time role was as part of the original London cast of the musical "Hair" in 1968, where he met Richard O'Brien who went on to write Curry's next full-time role, that of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in "The Rocky Horror Show" (1973). Curry recalled his first encounter with the project:
Originally, Curry rehearsed the character with a German accent and peroxide blond hair, and later, with an American accent. In March 2005, in an interview with Terry Gross of NPR's "Fresh Air", he explains that he decided to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter with an English accent after listening to an English woman say, "Do you have a house in town or a house in the country", and decided, "Yes, [Dr. Frank-N-Furter] should sound like the Queen".
Curry originally thought the character was merely a laboratory doctor dressed in a white lab coat. However, at the suggestion of director Sharman, the character evolved into the diabolical mad scientist and transvestite with an upper-class Belgravia accent. This change carried over to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", which made Curry a household name and gave him a cult following. He continued to play the character in London, Los Angeles, and New York City until 1975.
In an interview with NPR, Curry called "Rocky Horror" a "rite of passage", and added that the film is "a guaranteed weekend party to which you can go with or without a date and probably find one if you don't have one, and it's also a chance for people to try on a few roles for size, you know? Figure out, help them maybe figure out their own sexuality".
In 2016, Curry played The Criminologist in the of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show".
Theatre.
Shortly after the end of "Rocky Horror"s run on Broadway, Curry returned to the stage with Tom Stoppard's "Travesties", which ran in London and New York from 1975 to 1976. "Travesties" was a Broadway hit. It won two Tony Awards (Best Performance by an Actor for John Wood and Best Comedy), as well as the New York Drama Critics Circle Award (Best Play), and Curry's performance as the famous dadaist Tristan Tzara received good reviews.
In 1981, Curry formed part of the original cast in the Broadway show "Amadeus", playing the title character, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He was nominated for his first Tony Award (Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play) for this role but lost out to his co-star Ian McKellen, who played Antonio Salieri. In 1982, Curry took the part of the Pirate King in the Drury Lane production of Joe Papp's version of "The Pirates of Penzance" opposite George Cole, earning enthusiastic reviews.
In the mid-1980s, Curry performed in "The Rivals" and in several plays with the Royal National Theatre of Great Britain, including "The Threepenny Opera", "Dalliance" and "Love For Love". In 1988, Curry did the national tour of "Me and My Girl" as the lead role of Bill Snibson, a role originated on Broadway by Robert Lindsay and followed by Jim Dale. In 1989-90, Tim Curry returned once again to the New York stage in "The Art of Success". In 1993, Curry played Alan Swann in the Broadway musical version of "My Favourite Year", earning him his second Tony Award nomination, this time for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. In 2001, Curry appeared as Scrooge in the musical version of "A Christmas Carol" that played at Madison Square Garden.
In 2004, Curry began his role of King Arthur in "Spamalot" in Chicago. Written by Monty Python member Eric Idle and based on "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", the show successfully moved to Broadway in February 2005. It sold more than $1 million worth of tickets in its first 24 hours. His performance brought him a third Tony nomination, again for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. Curry reprised this role at the Palace Theatre in London's West End, where "Spamalot" opened on 16 October 2006. His final performance came on 6 January 2007. He was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award as the Best Actor in a Musical for the role, and also won the Theatregoers' Choice Award (getting 39% of the votes cast by over 12,000 theatregoers) as Best Actor in a Musical.
From May to August 2011, Curry was scheduled to portray the Player in a Trevor Nunn stage production of Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" at the Chichester Festival Theatre and then in London. He withdrew from the production on 27 May, citing ill health. From 26 to 29 April 2012, Tim Curry appeared in Eric Idle's play "What About Dick?" at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. He had originally appeared in the play back in 2007 when it was still a work in progress.
Curry's career in theatre was honoured on 7 June 2015 at the Actors Fund's 19th annual Tony Awards Viewing Party, where he was awarded an Artistic Achievement Award.
Film.
After "The Rocky Horror Picture Show", Curry began to appear in many films, acting in supporting roles, such as Robert Graves in the British horror film "The Shout", as Johnny LaGuardia in "Times Square", as Daniel Francis "Rooster" Hannigan in the 1982 film version of "Annie", and as Jeremy Hancock in the political film "The Ploughman's Lunch".
In 1985, Curry starred in the fantasy film "Legend" as The Lord of Darkness. Director Ridley Scott cast Curry in the film after watching him in "Rocky Horror", thinking he was ideal to play the role of Darkness. It took five and a half hours to apply the makeup needed for Darkness onto Curry and at the end of the day, he would spend an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. The same year, he appeared in the comedy mystery film "Clue" as Wadsworth the butler.
After this, Curry began to be cast in more comedy roles throughout the late 1980s and '90s such as Rev. Ray Porter in "Pass the Ammo", Dr. Thornton Poole in "Oscar", the suspicious Plaza Hotel concierge in "", Jigsaw in "Loaded Weapon 1" and as Long John Silver in "Muppet Treasure Island". Although he featured in mostly comedies throughout the '90s, he did appear in some action films, such as the thriller "The Hunt for Red October" as Dr. Yevgeniy Petrov, the 1993 adaptation of "The Three Musketeers" as Cardinal Richelieu, in the superhero film "The Shadow" as Farley Claymore, and as Herkermer Homolka in the 1995 action adventure "Congo".

One of Curry's best-known television roles (and best-known roles overall) is as Pennywise the Clown in the 1990 horror miniseries "Stephen King's It". Aside from one "Fangoria" interview in 1990, Curry never publicly acknowledged his involvement in "It" until an interview with Moviefone in 2015, where he called the role of Pennywise "a wonderful part", giving his blessing to successor Will Poulter; Poulter was set to play the character in the reboot, although ultimately dropped out. Bill Skarsgård replaced Poulter, and while being interviewed at Fan Expo Canada, Curry gave his approval, saying "I like [Bill] Skarsgård. I think he's very clever. It'll be interesting to see what sort of clown face he puts on. because it's not an obvious clown face at all.[..] So I'm fascinated to see it."
Voice acting.
Curry has appeared in many animated television series and films, starting with the performance of the Serpent in "".

Musical career.
Aside from his performances on various soundtrack records, Curry has had some success as a solo musical artist. Curry received classical vocal training as a boy. He has mentioned that his musical influences included jazz vocalists such as Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong and idolised the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as a teenager. In 1978, A&amp;M Records released Curry's debut solo album "Read My Lips". The album featured an eclectic range of songs (mostly covers) performed in diverse genres. Highlights of the album are a reggae version of the Beatles' song "I Will", a rendition of "Wake Nicodemus" featuring the Pipes and Drums of the 48th Highlanders of Canada, and a bar-room ballad, "Alan", composed by Canadian singer-songwriter Tony Kosinec.
The following year, Curry released his second and most successful album "Fearless". The LP was more rock-oriented than "Read My Lips" and mostly featured original songs rather than cover versions. The record included Curry's only US charting songs: "I Do the Rock" and "Paradise Garage".
Curry's third and final album, "Simplicity", was released in 1981, again by A&amp;M Records. This record, which did not sell as well as the previous offerings, combined both original songs and cover versions. Still, it was the only Curry recording to hit the charts in Canada, reaching #45 on the album chart. The writing, production, and musician roster for Curry's solo albums included an impressive list of collaborators, including Bob Ezrin, Dick Wagner, and David Sanborn.
In 1989, A&amp;M released "The Best of Tim Curry" on CD and cassette, featuring songs from his albums (including a live version of "Alan") and a previously unreleased song, a live cover version of Bob Dylan's "Simple Twist of Fate".
Curry toured North America and some European countries with his band between 1978 and 1980.
In 1990 Curry performed as the Prosecutor in Roger Waters' production of "The Wall – Live in Berlin".
Although Curry's first album was released in 1978, he had previously recorded a nine-track album for Lou Adler's Ode Records in 1976. However, the album remained unreleased in its entirety until February 2010, when it was made available as a legal download entitled "...From the Vaults" (though four tracks from these sessions had been released on a 1990 "Rocky Horror" box set). The album, produced by Adler, included Curry's rendition of The Supremes' hit "Baby Love".
Tim Curry was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal Studios fire.

Curry uses a wheelchair after suffering a major stroke in July 2012. This limited his acting to mostly voice-over, although he also continued to perform as a singer and started making appearances at fan conventions across North America.
In October 2020, he participated in a live table reading of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" in support of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin to raise funds for the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign.
