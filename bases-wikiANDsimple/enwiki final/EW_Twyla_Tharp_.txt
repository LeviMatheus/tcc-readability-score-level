Twyla Tharp (; born July 1, 1941) is an American dancer, choreographer, and author who lives and works in New York City. In 1966 she formed the company Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often uses classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music.
From 1971 to 1988 Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works. In 1973 Tharp choreographed "Deuce Coupe" to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. "Deuce Coupe" is considered the first "crossover ballet", a mix of ballet and modern dance. Later she choreographed "Push Comes to Shove" (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.
In 1988 Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre, since which time ABT has premiered 16 of Tharp's works.
On May 24, 2018, Tharp was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree by Harvard University.
Biography.
Early years.
Tharp was born in 1941 on a farm in Portland, Indiana, the daughter of Lecile Tharp, née Confer and William Tharp. She was named for Twila Thornburg, the "Pig Princess" of the 89th Annual Muncie Fair.
As a child, Tharp spent a few months each year living with her Quaker grandparents on their farm in Indiana. Her mother insisted she take lessons in dance, various musical instruments, shorthand, German and French. In 1950 Tharp's family—younger sister Twanette, twin brothers Stanley and Stanford, and her parents—moved to Rialto, California. William and Lecile operated Tharp Motors and Tharp Autos in Rialto. They opened a drive-in movie theater, where Tharp worked. The drive-in was on the corner of Acacia and Foothill, Rialto's major east–west artery and the path of Route 66. She attended Pacific High School in San Bernardino, studied at the Vera Lynn School of Dance, and studied ballet with Beatrice Collenette. A "devoted bookworm", Tharp says her schedule left little time for a social life. She attended Pomona College but transferred to Barnard College, where she graduated with a degree in art history in 1963. In New York she studied with Richard Thomas, Martha Graham and Merce Cunningham. In 1963 Tharp joined the Paul Taylor Dance Company.
Dances and ballets.
In 1965 Tharp choreographed her first dance, "Tank Dive", and formed her own company, Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often utilizes classical music, jazz, and contemporary pop music. From 1971 to 1988 Twyla Tharp Dance toured extensively around the world, performing original works.
In 1973 Tharp choreographed "Deuce Coupe" to the music of The Beach Boys for the Joffrey Ballet. "Deuce Coupe" is considered the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed "Push Comes to Shove" (1976), which featured Mikhail Baryshnikov and is now thought to be the best example of crossover ballet.
In 1988 Twyla Tharp Dance merged with American Ballet Theatre, since which time ABT has premiered 16 of Tharp's works. In 2010 it had 20 of her works in its repertory. Tharp has since choreographed dances for Paris Opera Ballet, The Royal Ballet, New York City Ballet, Boston Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Miami City Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Hubbard Street Dance and Martha Graham Dance Company. She also created the dance roadshow "Cutting Up" (1992) with Baryshnikov, which went on to tour and appeared in 28 cities over two months.
In 2000 Twyla Tharp Dance regrouped with entirely new dancers. This company also performed around the world, and with it Tharp developed the material that became "Movin' Out," an award-winning Broadway musical featuring the songs of Billy Joel and starring many of the dancers in the company.
In 2012 Tharp created the full-length ballet "The Princess and the Goblin", based on George MacDonald's story "The Princess and the Goblin". It is her first ballet to include children, and was co-commissioned by Atlanta Ballet and Royal Winnipeg Ballet and performed by both companies.
Tharp was the first Artist in Residency (A.I.R.) at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. During this time she created and premiered "Waiting At The Station", a work with music by R&amp;B artist Allen Toussaint and sets and costumes by longtime collaborator Santo Loquasto.
Broadway.
In 1980 Tharp's work first appeared on Broadway with Twyla Tharp Dance performing "When We Were Very Young", followed in 1981 by "The Catherine Wheel", her collaboration with David Byrne at the Winter Garden. "Wheel" was broadcast on PBS and its soundtrack released on LP.
In 1985 her staging of "Singin' in the Rain" played at the Gershwin for 367 performances.
Tharp premiered her dance musical "Movin' Out", set to the music and lyrics of Billy Joel, in Chicago in 2001. The show opened on Broadway in 2002. "Movin' Out" ran for 1,331 performances on Broadway. A national tour opened in January 2004. It received 10 Tony nominations and Tharp won Best Choreographer.
Tharp opened a new show, "The Times They Are a-Changin, to the music of Bob Dylan in 2005 at The Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. "The Times They are A-Changin set the records for the highest-grossing show and highest ticket sales as of the date of closing (March 2006). It was also the first show to receive a second extension before the first preview. After its run in California, the New York show ran for 35 previews and 28 performances.
In 2009 Tharp worked with the songs of Frank Sinatra to mount "Come Fly with Me", which ran at the Alliance Theater in Atlanta and was the best-selling four-week run as of the date of closing in 2009. Renamed "Come Fly Away", the show opened on Broadway in 2010 at the Marquis Theatre and ran for 26 previews and 188 performances. "Come Fly Away," was retooled and opened under the title "Sinatra: Dance with Me" at The Wynn Las Vegas in 2011. "Come Fly Away" National Tour opened in Atlanta in August 2011.
Film, television and print.
Tharp collaborated with film directors Miloš Forman on "Hair" (1978), "Ragtime" (1980) and "Amadeus" (1983); Taylor Hackford on "White Nights" (1985); and James Brooks on "I'll Do Anything" (1994).
Television credits include choreographing "Sue's Leg" (1976) for the inaugural episode of the PBS program "Dance in America"; co-producing and directing "Making Television Dance" (1977), which won the Chicago International Film Festival Award; and directing "The Catherine Wheel" (1983) for BBC Television. Tharp co-directed the award-winning television special "Baryshnikov by Tharp" in 1984.
Tharp has written three books: an early autobiography, "Push Comes to Shove" (1992; Bantam Books); "The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life" (2003, Simon &amp; Schuster), translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Korean, Thai and Japanese; and "The Collaborative Habit" (2009, Simon &amp; Schuster), also translated into Thai, Chinese and Korean. Tharp indicated that "The Creative Habit" is about cybernetics, especially in the several Greek-themed creative exercises, such as the Coin Drop; the Coin Drop, as an exercise in extracting ordered meaning from chaos, is derived from the astrological muse Urania, in that random coins falling onto a flat surface can be used to develop pattern analysis skills. The astrological theme is an etymological underpinning of cybernetics' tradition of "guiding a boat" by sighting stellar references according to ancient Greek navigation.
