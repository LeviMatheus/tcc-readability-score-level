The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . "U-2511" was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry 23 torpedoes or 17 torpedoes and 12 naval mine. The complement was five officers and 52 men.
Service history.
After training with 31st U-boat Flotilla, "U-2511" was transferred to 11th U-boat Flotilla at Bergen, Norway, for front-line service on 15 March 1945.
"U-2511" conducted one patrol. On the evening of 30 April 1945 (coincidentally the date of Hitler's death), "U-2511" set out from Bergen, Norway for the Caribbean, but on 4 May Schnee received the end-of-the-war cease-fire order. The commander of "U-2511" claimed the U-boat had a British cruiser in her sights on 4 May when news of the German cease-fire was received. He further claimed she made a practice attack before leaving the scene undetected.
Fate.
On 14 June 1945 "U-2511" was transferred from Bergen, and arrived at Londonderry Port on 21 June for Operation Deadlight. The U-boat was scuttled on 7 January 1946 at 7:40 pm in position . She was sunk by gunfire after her towing cable parted.
The wreck lies at a depth . She had been visited by divers at least three times, in 1999 and 2001, and circa 2012 for 'Dig WW2 with Dan Snow', revealing she is largely intact except for a large blast hole caused by the shellfire that sank her.
