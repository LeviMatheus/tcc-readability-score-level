This list of Internet top-level domains (TLD) contains top-level domains, which are those domains in the DNS root zone of the Domain Name System of the Internet. A list of the top-level domains by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is maintained at the Root Zone Database. IANA also oversees the approval process for new proposed top-level domains for ICANN. , their root domain contains 1502 top-level domains. , the IANA root database includes 1589 TLDs. That also includes 68 that are not assigned (revoked), 8 that are retired and 11 test domains. Those are not represented in IANA's listing and are not in root.zone file (root.zone file also includes one root domain).
Types.
IANA distinguishes the following groups of top-level domains:
Original top-level domains.
Seven generic top-level domains were created early in the development of the Internet, and predate the creation of ICANN in 1998.
Country code top-level domains.
As of 20 May 2017, there were 255 country-code top-level domains, purely in the Latin alphabet, using two-character codes. , this number is 316, with the addition of internationalized domains.
Proposed internationalized ccTLDs.
Internationalised domain names have been proposed for Japan and Libya.
Internationalized generic top-level domains.
All of these TLDs are internationalized domain names (IDN) and support second-level IDNs.
Special-Use Domains.
ICANN/IANA has created some Special-Use domain names which are meant for special technical purposes. ICANN/IANA owns all of the Special-Use domain names.
