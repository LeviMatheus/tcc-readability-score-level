German submarine "U-556" was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany's "Kriegsmarine" during World War II. She was laid down on 2 January 1940 at the Blohm &amp; Voss yard in Hamburg as yard number 532, launched on 7 December 1940, and commissioned on 6 February 1941 under the command of "Kapitänleutnant" Herbert Wohlfarth, who commanded her for her entire career. "U-556" conducted only two patrols, sinking six ships totalling and damaging one other of 4,986 tons, before she was sunk on 27 June 1941.
Design.
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. "U-556" had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .
The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . "U-556" was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.
Service history.
1st patrol.
"U-556" sailed from Kiel for her first patrol on 1 May 1941. She headed out into the waters of the northern Atlantic, south of Greenland. She made her first kill on 6 May, sinking the 166-ton Faroese fishing trawler "Emanuel" with her deck gun west of the Faroe Islands.
On 10 May she joined the wolfpack "West" attacking Convoy OB 318 south-east of Cape Farewell. Her first victim was the 4,986-ton British merchant ship "Aelybryn", hit by one of the torpedoes fired by the U-boat at 04:42. Badly damaged, but suffering only a single casualty, the ship was towed to Reykjavík by .
The convoy scattered, but at 07:52 "U-556" torpedoed and sank the 4,861-ton British merchant ship . Nine crew members and two gunners were later picked up by , but the master, 31 crewmen, and two gunners were lost.
The U-boat had her third success of the day at 20:37, sinking the 5,086-ton Belgian merchant ship "Gand". One crew member was lost and another wounded. The master, 38 crewmen and four gunners were rescued.
Ten days later, on 20 May, the wolfpack attacked Convoy HX 126. Between 14:48 and 15:16 "U-556" fired torpedoes at the convoy and sank two British merchant ships, the 4,974-ton "Darlington Court" and the 5,995-ton "Cockaponset", and the 8,470-ton tanker "British Security". Loaded with 11,200 tons of benzine and kerosene, the tanker caught fire and burned for three days before sinking. There were no survivors from her crew of 53.
The sinking of "Bismarck".
On 26 May, while returning from patrol, low on fuel and having fired all her torpedoes, "U-556" was ordered to reconnoitre the most recently reported position of the battleship .
"U-556" and "Bismarck" had been neighbours in the ways at Blohm &amp; Voss and their construction was completed at about the same time. ("Bismarck" was commissioned on 24 August 1940.) In January 1941, as "U-556"s commissioning ceremony approached, Wohlfarth wanted a band for the celebration, but could not afford to hire one. "Kapitän" Ernst Lindemann, commanding officer of "Bismarck", lent him his ship's band.
As thanks, Wohlfarth drew up a humorous "Patenschaftsurkunde" ("Certificate of Sponsorship") promising that "U-556" would protect "Bismarck". A drawing shows Wohlfarth as the knight Parzival [Percival] (his nickname) on the deck of "U-556" simultaneously bringing down planes with a sword and reaching underwater to stop a torpedo with his thumb. A second drawing then shows the submarine towing the battleship to safety.
The text accompanying the drawing reads:
Around 19:50, Wohlfahrt saw the battlecruiser and the aircraft carrier coming out of the mist at high speed. He recorded in his log, "Enemy bows on, 10 degrees to starboard, without destroyers, without zigzagging," but without any torpedoes, could only submerge and avoid them. Wohlfahrt saw activity on "Ark Royal"s flight deck, which transpired to be the launching of the second, fatal attack on "Bismarck". At 20:39, Wohlfahrt surfaced and transmitted, "Enemy in view, a battleship, an aircraft carrier, course 115, enemy is proceeding at high speed. Position 48° 20′ N, 16° 20′ W." "Renown"s and "Ark Royal"s course toward "Bismarck" coincided almost exactly with his own; he proceeded on the surface at full speed behind them.
Wohlfahrt's War Diary contains these entries for 27 May 1941:
Around 06:30 Wohlfahrt sighted and transferred the mission of maintaining contact with "Bismarck" to "Kapitänleutnant" Eitel-Friedrich Kentrat. He gave Kentrat "Bismarck"s position based on his observations of the star shells fired during the night, adding: "I have not seen her directly. You assume contact. I have no more fuel." Wohlfahrt then submerged and did not surface again until noon, a time at which radio signals were routinely repeated. That was when he heard for the first time the order radioed to him between 07:00 and 08:00 to pick up "Bismarck"s War Diary. He replied to the "Befehlshaber der U-Boote" ("Commander-in-Chief for Submarines") Karl Dönitz, asking that this mission be transferred to Kentrat, who received the radio order, "U-boat Kentrat pick up Bismarck War Diary," but was unable to locate "Bismarck". The battleship had been sunk before Wohlfahrt had received the first message at noon.
"U-556" arrived at Lorient, in occupied France on 30 May 1941 after 30 days at sea, where Wohlfahrt received the Knight's Cross ("Ritterkreuz") from Dönitz personally.
2nd patrol.
"U-556" departed from Lorient on 19 June 1941, and once more headed out into the Atlantic. However, on 27 June, she was sunk south-west of Iceland, in position , by depth charges from the British s , and . Five of the crew were killed and 41 survived.
Wolfpacks.
"U-556" took part in one wolfpack, namely.
