Year 472 (CDLXXII) was a leap year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Festus and Marcianus (or, less frequently, year 1225 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 472 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
