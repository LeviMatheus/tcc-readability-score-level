Réunion possesses a network of highways, which cover a total distance of 2,784km. Of that length, 2,187 km of the road system is paved. There are no roads going into the cirque of Mafate, thus transportation there has to take place by foot or helicopter.
Motorways.
A system of motorways that run between the main cities has been developed.
Sea.
There are two major ports in Réunion: Le Port and Pointe des Galets. There are six marinas. Réunion possesses a merchant marine of one ship with a weight exceeding 1,000 gt, which is a chemical tanker.
Airports.
There are two airports on the island, of which both have paved runways. The main airport is the international Roland Garros Airport located close to Saint Denis and the second one is the Aéroport de Pierrefond, located near Saint-Pierre in the south of the island.
Railways.
There are no railways in Réunion, with the exception of a short tourist line, which was originally part of a larger rail network. In 2019 a light rail system was proposed to link Le Barachois with the airport.
