AD 49 (XLIX) was a common year starting on Wednesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Longus and Veranius (or, less frequently, year 802 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 49 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
