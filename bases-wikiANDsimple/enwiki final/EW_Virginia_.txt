Virginia (), officially the Commonwealth of Virginia, is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States, between the Atlantic Coast and the Appalachian Mountains. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most-populous city, and Fairfax County is the most-populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's population is over 8.65million, with 36% of them living in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area.
The area's history begins with several indigenous groups, including the Powhatan. In 1607 the London Company established the Colony of Virginia as the first permanent English colony in the New World. Virginia's state nickname, the Old Dominion, is a reference to this status. Slave labor and land acquired from displaced native tribes fueled the early growth of the colony's plantation economy, but also fueled conflicts both inside and outside the colony. Virginia was one of the Thirteen Colonies in the American Revolution. Virginia was split by the American Civil War, when the state government in Richmond joined the Confederacy, which made that city its capital, but many counties remained loyal to the Union, and formed West Virginia. Although the Commonwealth was under one-party rule for nearly a century following Reconstruction, both major national parties are competitive in modern Virginia.
Virginia's state legislature is the Virginia General Assembly, which was established in 1619 and is the oldest continuous law-making body in North America. It is made up of a 40-member Senate and a 100-member House of Delegates. The state government is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits governors from serving consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including the headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency; and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.
Geography.
Virginia has a total area of , including of water, making it the 35th-largest state by area. Virginia is bordered by Maryland and Washington, D.C. to the north and east; by the Atlantic Ocean to the east; by North Carolina to the south; by Tennessee to the southwest; by Kentucky to the west; and by West Virginia to the north and west. Virginia's boundary with Maryland and Washington, D.C. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the Potomac River.
The Commonwealth's southern border is defined as 36°30' north latitude, though surveyor error in the 1700s led to deviations of as much as three arcminutes as the North Carolina border moved west. From 1802 to 1803, a commission appointed by Virginia and Tennessee surveyed the area and set their border as a line from the summit of White Top Mountain to the top of the Cumberland Mountains. Errors discovered in 1856 led Virginia to propose a new surveying commission in 1871, but in 1893 the U.S. Supreme Court decided in favor of the 1803 line in the case "Virginia v. Tennessee". One result of this is the division of the city of Bristol between the two states.
Geology and terrain.
The Chesapeake Bay separates the contiguous portion of the Commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of Virginia's Eastern Shore. The bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the Susquehanna River and the James River. Many of Virginia's rivers flow into the Chesapeake Bay, including the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James, which create three peninsulas in the bay, traditionally referred to as "necks" named Northern Neck, Middle Peninsula, and the Virginia Peninsula from north to south. Sea level rise has eroded the land on Virginia's islands, which include Tangier Island in the bay and Chincoteague, one of 23 barrier islands on the Atlantic coast.
The Tidewater is a coastal plain between the Atlantic coast and the fall line. It includes the Eastern Shore and major estuaries of Chesapeake Bay. The Piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the Mesozoic era. The region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the Southwest Mountains around Charlottesville. The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the Appalachian Mountains with the highest points in the Commonwealth, the tallest being Mount Rogers at . The Ridge and Valley region is west of the mountains and includes the Great Appalachian Valley. The region is carbonate rock based and includes Massanutten Mountain. The Cumberland Plateau and the Cumberland Mountains are in the southwest corner of Virginia, south of the Allegheny Plateau. In this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the Ohio River basin.
The Virginia Seismic Zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. Earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude, because Virginia is located away from the edges of the North American Plate. A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central Virginia on August 23, 2011, near Mineral, and was the Commonwealth's largest in at least a century. Due to the area's geologic properties, the earthquake was felt from Northern Florida to Southern Ontario. 35million years ago, a bolide impacted what is now eastern Virginia. The resulting Chesapeake Bay impact crater may explain what earthquakes and subsidence the region does experience.
Coal mining takes place in the three mountainous regions at 45 distinct coal beds near Mesozoic basins. More than 72million tons of other non-fuel resources, such as slate, kyanite, sand, or gravel, were also mined in Virginia . The Commonwealth's carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 limestone caves, ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular Luray Caverns and Skyline Caverns. Virginia's iconic Natural Bridge is also the remaining roof of a collapsed limestone cave.
Climate.
Virginia has a humid subtropical climate that transitions to humid continental west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Seasonal extremes vary from average lows of in January to average highs of in July. The Atlantic Ocean and Gulf Stream have a strong effect on eastern and southeastern coastal areas of the Commonwealth, making the climate there warmer and more constant. Most of Virginia's recorded extremes in temperature and precipitation have occurred in the Blue Ridge Mountains and areas west. Virginia receives an average of of precipitation annually, with the Shenandoah Valley being the state's driest region due to the mountains on either side.
Virginia has around 35–45 days with thunderstorms annually, and storms are common in the late afternoon and evenings between April and September. These months are also the most common for tornadoes, fifteen of which touched down in the Commonwealth in 2020. Hurricanes and tropical storms can occur from August to October, and though they typically impact coastal regions, the deadliest natural disaster in Virginia was Hurricane Camille, which killed over 150 people in 1969, mainly inland in Nelson County. Between December and March, cold-air damming caused by the Appalachian Mountains can lead to significant snowfalls across the state, such as the January 2016 blizzard, which created the state's highest recorded snowfall of near Bluemont. Virginia only received of snow during winter 2018–19, just above the state's average of .
Climate change in Virginia is leading to higher temperatures year-round as well as more heavy rain and flooding events. Urban heat islands can be found in many Virginia cities and suburbs, particularly in neighborhoods linked to historic redlining. Arlington had the most code orange days in 2020 for high ozone pollution in the air, with seven, followed by Fairfax County with four. Exposure of particulate matter in Virginia's air has decreased 49% from 13.5 micrograms per cubic meter in 2003 to 6.9 in 2020. The closure and conversion of coal power plants in Virginia and the Ohio Valley region has reduced haze in the mountains, which peaked in 1998. Coal has declined as a source of Virginia's electricity from 44% in 2008 to just 4% in 2019, and current plans call for 30% of the Commonwealth's electricity to be renewable by 2030 and for all to be carbon-free by 2050.
Ecosystem.
Forests cover 62% of Virginia , of which 78% is considered hardwood forest, meaning that trees in Virginia are primarily deciduous and broad-leaved. The other 22% is pine, with Loblolly and shortleaf pine dominating much of central and eastern Virginia. In the western and mountainous parts of the Commonwealth, oak and hickory are most common, while lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. Gypsy moth infestations in oak trees and the blight in chestnut trees have decreased both of their numbers, leaving more room for hickory and invasive ailanthus trees. In the lowland tidewater and Piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the Great Dismal and Nottoway swamps. Other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. The largest areas of wilderness are along the Atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in North America are found.
Virginia is home to more than one million white-tailed deer, whose population have rebounded from an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 during the Great Depression. Native carnivorans include black bears, bobcats, coyotes, both gray and red foxes, raccoons, and skunks. Rodents include groundhogs, weasels, nutria, beavers, both gray squirrels and fox squirrels, chipmunks, and Allegheny woodrats, while bats include brown bats and the Virginia big-eared bat, the state mammal. The Virginia opossum is also the only marsupial native to the United States and Canada, and the native Appalachian cottontail was recognized as a distinct species of rabbit in 1992.
Virginia's bird fauna consists of 422 counted species, of which 359 are regularly occurring, 41 are accidental (vagrant), 20 are hypothetical, and two are extinct; of the regularly occurring species, 214 have bred in Virginia, while the rest are winter residents or transients in Virginia. There are no species of bird endemic to the Commonwealth. Audubon recognizes 21 Important Bird Areas in the state. Peregrine falcons, whose numbers dramatically declined due to DDT pesticide poisoning in the middle of the 20th century, are the focus of conservation efforts in the state; as of 2017, Virginia had 31 breeding pairs of the bird, and a reintroduction program in Shenandoah National Park was underway.
Virginia has 226 species of freshwater fish, from 25 families; the state's diverse array of fish species is attributable to its varied and humid climate, topography, interconnected river system, and lack of Pleistocene glaciers. The state's lakes and rivers are home to Eastern blacknose dace and sculpin on the Appalachian Plateau; smallmouth bass and redhorse sucker in the Ridge and Valley region; brook trout, the state fish, and Kanawha darter in the Blue Ridge; stripeback darter and Roanoke bass in the Piedmont; and swampfish, bluespotted sunfish, and pirate perch in the Tidewater. The Chesapeake Bay is host to clams, oysters, and 350 species of saltwater and estuarine fish, including the bay's most abundant finfish, the Bay anchovy, as well as the invasive blue catfish. An estimated 405 million blue crabs live in the bay , and running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish. Amphibians found in Virginia include the Cumberland Plateau salamander and Eastern hellbender.
Virginia has thirty National Park Service units, such as Great Falls Park and the Appalachian Trail, and one national park, Shenandoah National Park. Shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic Skyline Drive. Almost forty percent () of the park's total area has been designated as wilderness under the National Wilderness Preservation System. Virginia also has 38 Virginia state parks, 3 undeveloped parks, and 63 natural areas, totaling , of which approximately are in state parks. All are managed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation except for Breaks Interstate Park. which lies on the Virginia-Kentucky border and is one of only two inter-state parks in the United States. There are 22 state forests and other state lands managed by the Virginia Department of Forestry, totaling . The Chesapeake Bay is not a national park, but is protected by both state and federal legislation and the inter-state Chesapeake Bay Program, which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed. The Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge extends into North Carolina, as does the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which marks the beginning of the Outer Banks.
History.
Virginia celebrated its quadricentennial year in 2007, marking 400 years since the establishment of the Jamestown Colony. The observances highlighted contributions from Native Americans, Africans, and Europeans, each of which had a significant part in shaping Virginia's history. Warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. Virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the French and Indian War, the American Revolution and the Civil War, to the Cold War and the War on Terrorism. Fictionalized stories about the early colony, in particular the story of Pocahontas and John Smith, first became popular in the period after the Revolutionary War, and together with other myths surrounding George Washington's childhood and plantation elite in the antebellum period became touchstones of Virginian and American culture and helped shape the state's historic politics and beliefs.
Original inhabitants.
The first people are estimated to have arrived in Virginia over 12,000 years ago. By 5,000 years ago, more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 AD. By 1500, the Algonquian peoples had founded towns such as Werowocomoco in the Tidewater region, which they referred to as "Tsenacommacah". The other major language groups in the area were the Siouan to the west and the Iroquoians, who included the Nottoway and Meherrin, to the north and south. After 1570, the Algonquians consolidated under Chief Powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network. Powhatan controlled more than thirty smaller tribes and more than 150 settlements, who shared a common Virginia Algonquian language. In 1607, the native Tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.
Colony.
Several European expeditions, including a group of Spanish Jesuits, explored the Chesapeake Bay during the 16th century. In 1583, Queen Elizabeth I of England granted Walter Raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of Spanish Florida. In 1584, Raleigh sent an expedition to the Atlantic coast of North America. The name "Virginia" may have been suggested then by Raleigh or Elizabeth, perhaps noting her status as the "Virgin Queen", and may also be related to a native phrase, "Wingandacoa", or name, "Wingina". Initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from South Carolina to Maine, plus the island of Bermuda. The London Company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary Charter of 1606, which granted land rights to this area. The company financed the first permanent English settlement in the "New World", Jamestown. Named for King James I, it was founded in May 1607 by Christopher Newport. In 1619, colonists took greater control with an elected legislature, later called the House of Burgesses. With the bankruptcy of the London Company in 1624, the settlement was taken into royal authority as an English crown colony.
Life in the colony was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, including the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes. By 1624, only 3,400 of the 6,000 early settlers had survived. However, European demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants. The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia. African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift to a system of African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to escape his servitude, and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655. Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.
Tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to Bacon's Rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as eighty percent of the population. Rebels, largely from the colony's frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at Middle Plantation of the Treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. Middle Plantation saw the founding of The College of William &amp; Mary in 1693 and was renamed Williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699. In 1747, a group of Virginian speculators formed the Ohio Company, with the backing of the British crown, to start English settlement and trade in the Ohio Country west of the Appalachian Mountains. France, which claimed this area as part of their colony of New France, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing French and Indian War became part of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). A militia from several British colonies, called the Virginia Regiment, was led by then-Lieutenant Colonel George Washington.
Statehood.
The British Parliament's efforts to levy new taxes following the French and Indian War were deeply unpopular in the colonies. In the House of Burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by Patrick Henry and Richard Henry Lee, among others. Virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the Continental Congress the following year. After the House of Burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, Virginia's revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the Virginia Conventions. On May 15, 1776, the Convention declared Virginia's independence from the British Empire and adopted George Mason's Virginia Declaration of Rights, which was then included in a new constitution. Another Virginian, Thomas Jefferson, drew upon Mason's work in drafting the national Declaration of Independence.
When the American Revolutionary War began in 1776, George Washington was selected to head the Continental Army, and many Virginians joined the army and other revolutionary militias. Virginia was the first colony to ratify the Articles of Confederation in December 1777. In April 1780, the capital was moved to Richmond at the urging of Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. British forces indeed landed around Portsmouth in October 1780, and soldiers under Benedict Arnold managed to raid Richmond in January 1781. Though a larger force, British indecision and maneuvers by Continental Army regiments under the Marquis de Lafayette and the French navy together trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula in September 1781, where troops under George Washington and Comte de Rochambeau converged and defeated British General Cornwallis in the siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.
Virginians were instrumental in the new country's early years and in writing the United States Constitution. James Madison drafted the Virginia Plan in 1787 and the Bill of Rights in 1789. Virginia ratified the Constitution on June 25, 1788. The three-fifths compromise ensured that Virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the House of Representatives. Together with the Virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the Commonwealth national importance. In 1790, both Virginia and Maryland ceded territory to form the new District of Columbia, though the Virginian area was retroceded in 1846. Virginia is called the "Mother of States" because of its role in being carved into states such as Kentucky, which became the fifteenth state in 1792, and for the numbers of American pioneers born in Virginia.
Civil War.
In addition to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. Soil exhausted by years of tobacco farming also pushed the plantation economy to expand westward. The failed slave uprisings of Gabriel Prosser in 1800 and Nat Turner in 1831 however marked the growing resistance to the system of slavery. One response to Nat Turner's rebellion by the Virginia government was to arrange for ships to transport free Blacks to Liberia. On October 16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown led a raid on an armory in Harpers Ferry in an attempt to start a slave revolt across the southern states. The polarized national response to his raid and execution marked a tipping point for many who believed the end of slavery would need to be achieved by force. By 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 31% of the total population of Virginia, were enslaved.
Open warfare started on April 12, 1861 at the Battle of Fort Sumter in South Carolina, the first state to secede from the United States. The next week President Lincoln called for armed volunteers while in Virginia, a special convention called by the General Assembly voted to secede on the condition it was approved in a referendum the next month. The convention then voted on April 24 to join the Confederate States of America, which named Richmond as its capital on May 20. During the referendum, armed pro-Confederate groups prevented the casting and counting of votes from many northwestern counties that opposed secession. Representatives from 27 of these counties instead attended the Wheeling Convention, which organized a government loyal to the Union and led to the separation of West Virginia as a new state.
Union forces reached the outskirts of Richmond by June 1862, but Virginian general Robert E. Lee took command of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, and repelled the Union army, led invasions into Union territory, and was named General in Chief of Confederate armies in February 1865. During the war, more battles were fought in Virginia than anywhere else, including the Battles of Bull Run, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and the concluding Battle of Appomattox Court House, where Lee surrendered on April 9, 1865. After the capture of Richmond that month, the state capital was briefly moved to Lynchburg, while the Confederate leadership fled to Danville. 32,751 Virginians died in the Civil War. Virginia was formally restored to the United States in 1870, due to the work of the Committee of Nine.
Reconstruction and Jim Crow.
During the post-war Reconstruction era, African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society. Virginia adopted a constitution in 1868 which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. However, with much of the railroads and other infrastructure investments destroyed during the Civil War, the Commonwealth was deeply in debt, and in the late 1870s redirected money from public schools to pay bondholders. The Readjuster Party formed in 1877 and won legislative power in 1879 by uniting Black and white Virginians behind a shared opposition to debt payments and the perceived plantation elites.
In 1883, the Readjusters were divided by a proposed repeal of anti-miscegenation laws, and days before that year's election, a riot in Danville involving armed policemen left four Black men and one white man dead. These events motivated a push by white supremacists to seize political power, and segregationists in the Democratic Party won the legislature that year and maintained control for decades. They passed Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the state constitution to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites.
New economic forces would meanwhile industrialize the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new industrial scale production centered around Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six World War I-era dreadnoughts, seven battleships, and 25 destroyers for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, had to contend with the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.
Civil Rights to present.
Protests against segregated schools started by Barbara Rose Johns in 1951 in Farmville led to the lawsuit "Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County". This case, filed by Richmond natives Spottswood Robinson and Oliver Hill, was decided in 1954 with "Brown v. Board of Education", which rejected the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal". But, in 1958, under the policy of "massive resistance" led by the influential segregationist Senator Harry F. Byrd and his Byrd Organization, the Commonwealth prohibited desegregated local schools from receiving state funding as part of the Stanley Plan. The school closure was again challenged in court, and in 1964 the Supreme Court ordered Prince Edward County and others to integrate schools.
The civil rights movement gained many participants during the 1960s. They achieved the moral force and support to gain passage of national legislation with the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1967, the Supreme Court also struck down the state's ban on interracial marriage with "Loving v. Virginia". From 1969 to 1971, state legislators under Governor Mills Godwin rewrote the constitution, after goals such as the repeal of Jim Crow laws had been achieved. In 1977, Black members became the majority of Richmond's city council, in 1989, Douglas Wilder became the first African American elected as governor in the United States, and in 1992, Bobby Scott became the first Black congressman from Virginia since 1888.
The Cold War led to the expansion of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth. The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was flown into the building. Mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 and in Virginia Beach in 2019 led to passage of gun control measures in 2020. Racial injustice and the presence of Confederate monuments in Virginia have also led to large demonstrations, including in August 2017, when a white supremacist drove his car into protesters, killing one, and in June 2020, when protests that were part of the larger Black Lives Matter movement brought about the removal of statues on Monument Avenue in Richmond and elsewhere.
Cities and towns.
Virginia is divided into 95counties and 38independent cities, the latter acting in many ways as county-equivalents. This general method of treating cities and counties on par with each other is unique to Virginia; only three other independent cities exist elsewhere in the United States, each in a different state. The differences between counties and cities are small and have to do with how each assess new taxes, whether a referendum is necessary to issue bonds, and with the application of Dillon's Rule, which limits the authority of cities and counties to countermand acts expressly allowed by the General Assembly. Within counties, there can also be incorporated towns, which operate their own governments, and unincorporated communities, which don't. Virginia does not have any further political subdivisions, such as villages or townships.
Over 3.1million people, 36% of Virginians, live in Northern Virginia, which is part of the larger Washington metropolitan area and the Northeast megalopolis. Fairfax County is the most populous locality in the state, with more than 1.1million residents, although that does not include its county seat Fairfax City, which is one of the independent cities. Fairfax County has a major urban business and shopping center in Tysons Corner, Virginia's largest office market. Neighboring Prince William County is Virginia's second most populous county, with a population exceeding 450,000, and is home to Marine Corps Base Quantico, the FBI Academy and Manassas National Battlefield Park. Loudoun County, with the county seat at Leesburg, is the fastest-growing county in the state. Arlington County, the smallest self-governing county in the U.S. by land area, is very urban and has considered reorganizing as an independent city.
Richmond is the capital of Virginia, and its metropolitan area has a population over 1.2million. , Virginia Beach is the most populous independent city in the Commonwealth, with Chesapeake and Norfolk second and third, respectively. The three are part of the larger Hampton Roads metropolitan area, which has a population over 1.7million people and is the site of the world's largest naval base, Naval Station Norfolk. Suffolk, which includes a portion of the Great Dismal Swamp, is the largest city by area at . In western Virginia, Roanoke city and Montgomery County, part of the Blacksburg–Christiansburg metropolitan area, both have surpassed a population of over 100,000 since 2018.
Demographics.
The United States Census Bureau found the state resident population was 8,631,393 on April 1, 2020, a 7.9% increase since the 2010 United States Census. Another 23,149 Virginians live overseas, giving the state a total population of 8,654,542. Virginia has the fourth largest overseas population of U.S. states due to its federal employees and military personnel. The birth rate in Virginia was 11.4 per 1,000 over five years, and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by median age|median age]] was 38.4 years old, both identical to the national averages . , the [[center of population]] was located in [[Louisa County, Virginia|Louisa County]], near [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].
[[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] between 2010 and 2018 from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 159,627 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 155,205 people. Aside from Virginia, the top birth state for Virginians is [[New York (state)|New York]], having overtaken [[North Carolina]] in the 1990s, with the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] accounting for the largest number of domestic migrants into the state by region. About twelve percent of residents were born outside the United States . [[El Salvador]] was the most common foreign country of birth, with [[India]], [[South Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[the Philippines]] as other common birthplaces.
Ethnicity.
The state's most populous ethnic group, [[Non-Hispanic whites]], has declined as a proportion of population from 76% in 1990 to 61% in 2019, as other ethnicities have increased. Immigrants from the islands of Britain and Ireland settled throughout the Commonwealth during the colonial period, a time when roughly three-fourths of immigrants came as [[indentured servant]]s. Those who identify on the census as having "[[American ethnicity]]" are predominantly of English descent, but have ancestors who have been in North America for so long they choose to identify simply as American. The western mountains have many settlements that were founded by [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish immigrants]] before the [[American Revolution]]. There are also sizable numbers of people of German descent in the northwestern mountains and [[Shenandoah Valley]], and 10.6% of Virginians are estimated to have German ancestry, .

The largest minority group in Virginia are Blacks and African Americans, who include about one-fifth of the population. Virginia was a major destination of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and the first generations of enslaved men, women and children were brought primarily from [[Angola]] and the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]]. The [[Igbo American|Igbo]] ethnic group of what is now southern [[Nigeria]] were the single largest African group among slaves in Virginia. Blacks in Virginia also have more European ancestry than those in other southern states, and DNA analysis shows many have asymmetrical male and female ancestry contribution, indicating male European lines mixing with female African and Native American lines. Though the Black population was reduced by the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to northern industrial cities in the first half of the 20th century, since 1965 there has been a reverse migration of Blacks [[New Great Migration|returning south]]. The Commonwealth has the highest number of Black-white interracial marriages in the United States, and 3.2% of Virginians describe themselves as [[biracial]].
More recent immigration in the late 20th century and early 21st century has resulted in new communities of Hispanics and Asians. , 9.8% of Virginia's total population describe themselves as [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]], and 6.9% as [[Asian people|Asian]]. The state's Hispanic population rose by 92% from 2000 to 2010, with two-thirds of Hispanics in the state living in [[Northern Virginia]]. Hispanic citizens in Virginia have higher median household incomes and educational attainment than the general state population. Northern Virginia also has a significant population of [[Vietnamese American]]s, whose major wave of immigration followed the [[Vietnam War]]. [[Korean American]]s have migrated more recently, attracted by the quality school system. The [[Filipino American]] community has about 45,000 in the Hampton Roads area, many of whom have ties to the [[U.S. Navy]] and armed forces.
[[Native American tribes in Virginia|Tribal membership in Virginia]] is complicated by the legacy of the state's "[[Racial Integrity Act of 1924|pencil genocide]]" of intentionally categorizing Native Americans and Blacks together, and many tribal members do have African and European ancestry. In 2019, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 0.5% of Virginians were [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] or [[Alaska Native]], and 0.1% were [[Native Hawaiian]] or other [[Pacific Islander]]. Virginia has extended [[State-recognized tribes in the United States|state recognition]] to eleven indigenous tribes resident in the state. Seven tribes also have federal recognition, including six that were recognized in 2018 after passage of bill named for activist [[Thomasina Jordan]]. The [[Pamunkey]] and [[Mattaponi]] have reservations on tributaries of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] in the [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater region]].
Languages.
, 85.9% (6,299,127) of Virginia residents age five and older spoke [[English language|English]] at home as a [[first language]], while 14.1% (1,036,442) did not—6.4% (470,058) spoke [[Spanish language|Spanish]], 0.8% (56,518) [[Korean language|Korean]], 0.6% (45,881) [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], 0.6% (42,418) [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (including [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]), and 0.6% (40,724) [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. English was passed as the Commonwealth's official language by statutes in 1981 and again in 1996, though the status is not mandated by the [[Constitution of Virginia]].
The [[Piedmont region of Virginia|Piedmont]] region is known for its dialect's strong influence on [[Southern American English]]. While a more homogenized [[American English]] is found in urban areas, various accents are also used, including the [[Tidewater accent]], the [[Old Virginia accent]], and the anachronistic [[Early Modern English|Elizabethan]] of [[Tangier Island]].
Religion.
Virginia is predominantly Christian and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]; [[Baptists|Baptist denominations]] combined to form largest group with over a quarter of the population , and around 763,655 total members . Baptist denominational groups in Virginia include the [[Baptist General Association of Virginia]], with about 1,400 member churches, which supports both the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] and the moderate [[Cooperative Baptist Fellowship]]; and the [[Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia]] with more than 500 affiliated churches, which supports the Southern Baptist Convention. [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|Roman Catholics]] are the second-largest religious group with 673,853 members. The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Arlington]] includes most of Northern Virginia's Catholic churches, while the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond|Diocese of Richmond]] covers the rest.

The Virginia Conference is the [[Annual Conference|regional body]] of the [[United Methodist Church]] in most of the Commonwealth, while the Holston Conference represents much of extreme Southwest Virginia. The [[Virginia Synod]] is responsible for the congregations of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Lutheran Church]]. [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], and Episcopalian adherents each comprised less than two percent of the population . The [[Episcopal Diocese of Virginia]], [[Episcopal Diocese of Southern Virginia|Southern Virginia]], and [[Episcopal Diocese of Southwestern Virginia|Southwestern Virginia]] support the various [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal churches]].
In November 2006, fifteen conservative Episcopal churches voted to split from the Diocese of Virginia over the ordination of openly [[gay bishops]] and clergy in other dioceses of the Episcopal Church; these churches continue to claim affiliation with the larger [[Anglican Communion]] through [[Anglican realignment|other bodies outside the United States]]. Though Virginia law allows parishioners to determine their church's affiliation, the diocese claimed the secessionist churches' buildings and properties. The resulting property law case, ultimately decided in favor of the mainline diocese, was a test for Episcopal churches nationwide.
Among other religions, adherents of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] constitute one percent of the population, with two hundred [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Virginia|congregations in Virginia]] . [[Fairfax Station, Virginia|Fairfax Station]] is the site of the [[Ekoji Buddhist Temple]], of the [[Jodo Shinshu]] school, and the Hindu [[Durga]] Temple. While the state's Jewish population is small, organized Jewish sites date to 1789 with [[Congregation Beth Ahabah]]. [[Muslims]] are a growing religious group throughout the Commonwealth through immigration. [[Megachurch]]es in the Commonwealth include [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]], [[Immanuel Bible Church]], and [[McLean Bible Church]]. Several Christian universities are also based in the state, including [[Regent University]], [[Liberty University]], and the [[University of Lynchburg]].
Economy.
[[File:Virginia-Median household income.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Virginia counties and cities by median household income (2010)]]
Virginia's economy has diverse sources of income, including local and federal government, military, farming and high-tech. The state's average earnings per job was $63,281, the 11th-highest nationwide, and the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) was $476.4billion in 2018, the 13th-largest among U.S. states. Prior to the [[COVID-19 recession]], in March 2020, Virginia had 4.36million people employed with an unemployment rate of 2.9%, but jobless claims due to the virus soared over 10% in early April 2020, before leaving off around 5% in November 2020. In March 2021, it was 5.1%, which was the 24th-lowest nationwide. Virginia however ranks worst in the nation for timely review of [[unemployment benefits]] due to the pandemic.
Virginia has a [[median household income]] of $72,600, 11th-highest nationwide, and a poverty rate of 10.7%, 12th-lowest nationwide, .

Though the [[List of U.S. states by Gini coefficient|Gini index]] shows Virginia has less [[income inequality]] than the national average, the state's middle class is also smaller than the majority of states.
Government.

Virginia was home to 653,193 separate firms in the 2012 U.S. Census Survey of Business Owners, with 54% of those majority male-owned and 36.2% majority female-owned. Approximately 28.3% of firms were also majority minority-owned, and 11.7% were veteran-owned.

The largest by their number of employees are [[Dollar Tree]] in [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] and [[Hilton Worldwide Holdings]] in [[McLean, Virginia|McLean]].
Virginia's business environment has been ranked highly by various publications. In 2019, [[CNBC]] named Virginia their [[America's Top States For Business|Top State for Business]], with its deductions being mainly for the high cost of living, while "[[Forbes]]" magazine ranked it fourth, though number one in quality of life. Additionally, in 2014 a survey of 12,000 small business owners found Virginia to be one of the most friendly states for small businesses. [[Oxfam America]] however ranked Virginia as the fourteenth worst state to work in, with pluses for new worker protections from sexual harassment and [[pregnancy discrimination]], but negatives for laws on organized labor and the low [[minimum wage]] of $7.25 an hour. Virginia has been an [[At-will employment|employment-at-will]] state since 1906 and a "[[right to work]]" state since 1947. The minimum wage was raised to $9.50 an hour in April 2021, with plans to increase it to $12 in 2023.
Virginia has the highest concentration of technology workers of any state, and the fourth-highest number of technology workers after [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]]. [[Integrated circuit|Computer chips]] became the state's highest-grossing export in 2006, with a total export value of $827million in 2020.

The state has the highest average and peak internet speeds in the United States, with the third-highest worldwide. Northern Virginia's [[data center]]s can carry up to seventy percent of the nation's internet traffic, and in 2015 the region was the largest and fastest growing data center market in the nation.
Tourism in Virginia supported an estimated 234,000 jobs in 2018, making tourism the state's fifth largest industry. It generated $26billion, an increase 4.4% from 2017. The state was eighth nationwide in domestic travel spending in 2018, with [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]] the top tourist destination in the state by domestic spending, followed by [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]. Virginia also saw 1.1million international tourists in 2018, a five percent increase from 2017.
Agriculture.
[[File:Farmers in Rockingham County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|[[Rockingham County, Virginia|Rockingham County]] accounts for twenty percent of Virginia's agricultural sales .|alt=Two adult men in green and red baseball caps work with their hands while crouching down in a field of wide green leaves.]]
, agriculture occupied 28% of the land in Virginia with 7.8million acres (12,188 sq mi; 31,565 km2) of farmland. Nearly 54,000 Virginians work on the state's 43,225 farms, which average . Though agriculture has declined significantly since 1960 when there were twice as many farms, it remains the largest single industry in Virginia, providing for over 334,000 jobs. Soybeans were the most profitable crop in Virginia in 2017, ahead of corn and cut flowers as other leading agricultural products. However, the ongoing [[China–United States trade war|China-U.S. trade war]] led many Virginia farmers to plant cotton instead of soybeans in 2019. Though it is no longer the primary crop, Virginia is still the third-largest [[Cultivation of tobacco|producer of tobacco]] in the United States.
Virginia is also the country's third-largest producer of seafood , with [[Placopecten magellanicus|sea scallops]], oysters, [[Callinectes sapidus|Chesapeake blue crabs]], [[menhaden]], and hardshell clams as the largest seafood harvests by value, and [[France]], [[Canada]], and [[Hong Kong]] as the top export destinations. Commercial fishing supports 18,220 jobs , while recreation fishing supports another 5,893. [[Eastern oyster]] harvests had increased from 23,000 bushels in 2001 to over 500,000 in 2013, but fell to 248,347 in 2019 because of low [[salinity]] in coastal waters due to heavy spring rains. Those same rains however made 2019 a record wine harvest for vineyards in the [[Northern Neck]] and along the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], which also attract 2.3million tourists annually. Virginia has the seventh-highest number of wineries in the nation, with 307 . [[Cabernet franc]] and [[Chardonnay]] are the most grown varieties.
Taxes.
Virginia collects [[State income tax|personal income tax]] from those with incomes above a [[Tax return (United States)|filing threshold]]; there are five income brackets, with rates ranging from 2.0% to 5.75% of taxable income. The [[Sales taxes in the United States|state sales]] and [[use tax]] rate is 4.3%. There is an additional 1% local tax, for a total of a 5.3% combined [[sales tax]] on most Virginia purchases. The sales tax rate is higher in three regions: Northern Virginia (6%), Hampton Roads (6%) and the [[Historic Triangle]] (7%). Unlike the majority of states, Virginia collects sales tax on groceries, but at a lower rate than the general sales tax; the sales tax for food and certain essential personal hygiene goods is 2.5%.
Virginia's [[Property tax in the United States|property tax]] is set and collected at the local government level and varies throughout the Commonwealth. Real estate is also taxed at the local level based on one hundred percent of fair market value. As of fiscal year 2018, the median real estate tax rate per $100 of assessed taxable value was $1.07 for cities, $0.67 for counties, and $0.17 for towns; town rates are lower because towns (unlike cities) have a narrow range of responsibilities and are subordinate to counties. Of local government tax revenue, about 61% is generated from real property taxes; about 24% from tangible personal property, sales and use, and business license tax; and 15% from other taxes (such as restaurant meal taxes, public service corporation property tax, consumer utility tax, and [[hotel tax]]).
Culture.
[[File:Colonial Williamsburg ladies.jpg|thumb|Colonial Virginian culture, language, and style are reenacted in [[Colonial Williamsburg|Williamsburg]].|alt=Five women dressed in long colonial style clothing sit on the stairs of tan and beige buildings talking. In front of them is a wooden wheelbarrow full of wicker baskets.]]
Virginia's culture was popularized and spread across America and the [[Southern United States|South]] by figures such as [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. Their homes in Virginia represent the birthplace of America and the South. Modern Virginia culture has many sources, and is part of the [[culture of the Southern United States]]. The [[Smithsonian Institution]] divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.
Besides the general [[cuisine of the Southern United States]], Virginia maintains its own particular traditions. [[Virginia wine]] is made in many parts of the Commonwealth. [[Smithfield ham]], sometimes called "Virginia ham", is a type of [[country ham]] which is [[Geographical indication|protected by state law]], and can be produced only in the town of [[Smithfield, Virginia|Smithfield]]. [[Virginia furniture]] and architecture are typical of [[American colonial architecture]]. Thomas Jefferson and many of the Commonwealth's early leaders favored the [[Neoclassical architecture]] style, leading to its use for important state buildings. The [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] and their style can also be found in parts of the Commonwealth.
Literature in Virginia often deals with the Commonwealth's extensive and sometimes troubled past. The works of [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Ellen Glasgow]] often dealt with social inequalities and the role of women in her culture. Glasgow's peer and close friend [[James Branch Cabell]] wrote extensively about the changing position of gentry in the [[Reconstruction era]], and challenged its moral code with "[[Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice]]". [[William Styron]] approached history in works such as "[[The Confessions of Nat Turner (1967)|The Confessions of Nat Turner]]" and "[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]". [[Tom Wolfe]] has occasionally dealt with his southern heritage in bestsellers like "[[I Am Charlotte Simmons]]". [[Mount Vernon, Virginia|Mount Vernon]] native [[Matt Bondurant]] received critical acclaim for his [[historical fiction|historic novel]] "[[The Wettest County in the World]]" about moonshiners in [[Franklin County, Virginia|Franklin County]] during [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]]. Virginia also names a [[Poet Laureate of Virginia|state Poet Laureate]].
Fine and performing arts.

Rich in cultural heritage, Virginia however ranks near the middle of U.S. states in terms of public spending on the arts , at just over half of the national average. The state government does fund some institutions, including the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]] and the [[Science Museum of Virginia]]. Other museums include the popular [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]] of the [[National Air and Space Museum]] and the [[Chrysler Museum of Art]]. Besides these sites, many open-air museums are located in the Commonwealth, such as [[Colonial Williamsburg]], the [[Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia|Frontier Culture Museum]], and various historic battlefields. The [[Virginia Foundation for the Humanities]] works to improve the Commonwealth's civic, cultural, and intellectual life.
Theaters and venues in the Commonwealth are found both in the cities and in suburbs. The [[Harrison Opera House]], in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]], is home of the [[Virginia Opera]]. The [[Virginia Symphony Orchestra]] operates in and around [[Hampton Roads]]. Resident and touring theater troupes operate from the [[American Shakespeare Center]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. The [[Barter Theatre]] in [[Abingdon, Virginia|Abingdon]], designated the State Theatre of Virginia, won the first [[Regional Theatre Tony Award]] in 1948, while the [[Signature Theatre (Arlington, Virginia)|Signature Theatre]] in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] won it in 2009. There is also a Children's Theater of Virginia, [[Theatre IV]], which is the second largest touring troupe nationwide. Notable music performance venues include [[The Birchmere]], the [[Landmark Theater (Richmond, Virginia)|Landmark Theater]], and [[Jiffy Lube Live]]. [[Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts]] is located in [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]] and is the only national park intended for use as a performing arts center.
Virginia has launched many award-winning traditional musical artists and internationally successful popular music acts, as well as Hollywood actors. Virginia is known for its tradition in the music genres of [[Old-time music|old-time string]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], with groups such as the [[Carter Family]] and [[Stanley Brothers]]. The state's African tradition is found through [[Gospel (music)|gospel]], [[blues]], and [[shout band]]s, with both [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Pearl Bailey]] coming from [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]]. Contemporary Virginia is also known for [[folk rock]] artists like [[Dave Matthews]] and [[Jason Mraz]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] stars like [[Pharrell Williams]], [[Missy Elliott]] and [[Pusha T]], as well as [[thrash metal]] groups like [[GWAR]] and [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]]. Several members of [[country music]] band [[Old Dominion (band)|Old Dominion]] grew up in the [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] area, and took their band name from Virginia's state nickname.
Festivals.

Education.
[[File:BUF IMG 5559 (33491723285).jpg|thumb|Virginia's public schools serve over a million students at over 2,200 schools.|alt=Five middle school students work together at a table using a soldering iron.]]
Virginia's educational system consistently ranks in the top five states on the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education's]] [[National Assessment of Educational Progress]], with Virginia students outperforming the average in all subject areas and grade levels tested. The 2020 "[[Education Week#Quality Counts|Quality Counts]]" report ranked Virginia's K–12 education eighth in the country, with a letter grade of B. All school divisions must adhere to educational standards set forth by the [[Virginia Department of Education]], which maintains an assessment and accreditation regime known as the [[Standards of Learning]] to ensure accountability.
[[Public school (government funded)|Public]] [[K–12 (education)|K–12 schools]] in Virginia are generally operated by the counties and cities, and not by the state. a total of 1,290,576 students were enrolled in 2,293 local and regional schools in the Commonwealth, including eight [[charter school]]s, and an additional 98 alternative and special education centers across 133 [[List of school divisions in Virginia|school divisions]]. 2018 marked the first decline in overall enrollment in public schools, by just over 2,000 students, since 1984. Besides the general public schools in Virginia, there are [[Governor's Schools (Virginia)|Governor's Schools]] and selective [[magnet school]]s. The Governor's Schools are a collection of more than forty regional high schools and summer programs intended for gifted students.

In 2019, 91.5% of high school students graduated on-time after four years, an increase of two percent from 2013, and 89.3% of adults over the age 25 had their high school diploma. Virginia has one of the smaller racial gaps in graduation rates among U.S. states, with 89.7% of Black students graduating on time, compared to 94.7% of white students and 97.5% of Asian students. Despite ending [[School segregation in the United States|school segregation]] in the 1960s, seven percent of Virginia's public schools were rated as "intensely segregated" by [[The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles|The Civil Rights Project at UCLA]] in 2019, and the number has risen since 1989, when only three percent were. Virginia has comparatively large public school districts, typically comprising entire counties or cites, and this helps mitigate funding gaps seen in other states such that non-white districts average slightly more funding, $255 per student , than majority white districts. Elementary schools, with Virginia's smallest districts, were found to be more segregated than state middle or high schools by a 2019 VCU study.
Colleges and universities.
[[File:University-of-Virginia-Rotunda.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Virginia]], a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], guarantees full tuition scholarships to all in-state students from families earning up to $80,000.]]

Virginia has a mixed health record, and was ranked as the 21st for both overall health outcomes and healthy behaviors in the state according to the 2020 United Health Foundation's Health Rankings. Virginia was nineteenth lowest among U.S. states both in its number of premature deaths, with 6,863 per 100,000, and in its [[infant mortality]] rate, with 5.61 per 1,000 live births. The rate of uninsured Virginians dropped to 7.9% in 2020, following an expansion of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] the year before. [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] and [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun County]] were both ranked in the top ten healthiest communities in 2020 by "U.S. News &amp; World Report".
There are however racial and social health disparities. With high rates of heart disease and diabetes, African Americans in Virginia had an average life expectancy four years lower than whites and twelve years lower than Asian Americans and Latinos in 2017, and were disproportionately affected by [[COVID-19]] during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Virginia|coronavirus pandemic]]. African-American mothers are also three times more likely to [[Maternal mortality in the United States|die while giving birth]] in the state. Mortality rates among white middle-class Virginians have also been rising, with drug overdose, alcohol poisoning, and suicide as leading causes. Suicides in the state increased by 21% between 2009 and 2018.

In 2008, Virginia became the first U.S. state to mandate the [[HPV vaccine]] for girls for school attendance, and 55.2% of adolescents have the vaccine.
The [[Virginia Board of Health]] regulates health care facilities, and there are ninety [[List of hospitals in Virginia|hospitals in Virginia]] with a combined 17,706 hospital beds . Notable examples include [[Inova Fairfax Hospital]], the largest hospital in the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], and the [[VCU Medical Center]], located on the medical campus of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]]. The University of Virginia Medical Center, part of the [[University of Virginia Health System]], is highly ranked in [[endocrinology]] according to "[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]". Virginia has a ratio of 230.3 [[primary care physician]]s per 10,000 residents, the fifteenth worst rate nationally, and only 193.2 mental health providers per that number, the eleventh worst nationwide. , the state's eight public mental health care facilities were 96% full, causing delays in admissions.
Transportation.
[[File:Rosslyn Metro 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Rosslyn station]] in [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] is the busiest [[choke point]] of the [[Washington Metro]] subway system.]]
Because of the 1932 [[Byrd Road Act]], the state government controls most of Virginia's roads, instead of a local county authority as is usual in other states. , the [[Virginia Department of Transportation]] owns and operates of the total of roads in the state, making it the third largest state highway system in the United States. Traffic on Virginia's roads is among the worst in the nation according to the 2018 American Community Survey. The average commute time of 28.4 minutes ranks 42nd among other states, and the Washington Metropolitan Area, which includes [[Northern Virginia]], has the second worst rate of traffic congestion among U.S. cities. About 9.2% of workers in Virginia reported carpooling to work in 2018, while 4.4% commuted on public transit, and Virginia hit [[peak car]] usage before the year 2000, making it one of the first such states.
There were over 171.9 million trips taken on public transit in Virginia in 2019, over 62% of which were done on the [[Washington Metro]] transit system, which serves [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], and extends into [[Loudoun County, Virginia|Loudoun]] and [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax Counties]]. Virginia has [[Amtrak]] passenger rail service along several corridors, and [[Virginia Railway Express]] (VRE) maintains two commuter lines into Washington, D.C. from [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]] and [[Manassas, Virginia|Manassas]]. VRE averaged over 90,000 weekly riders in 2019, but saw a dramatic 90% decline in ridership due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Virginia|COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020. Major freight railroads in Virginia include [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation]], and in 2021 the state finalized a deal to purchase of track and over of right of way from CSX for future passenger rail service. Commuter buses include the [[Fairfax Connector]], [[Fredericksburg Regional Transit|FRED]] buses in Fredericksburg, and [[Potomac and Rappahannock Transportation Commission|OmniRide]] in [[Prince William County, Virginia|Prince William County]]. The Virginia Department of Transportation operates several free ferries throughout Virginia, the most notable being the [[Jamestown Ferry]] which connects [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] to [[Scotland, Virginia|Scotland Wharf]] across the [[James River, Virginia|James River]].
Virginia has five major airports: [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles International]] and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport|Reagan Washington National]] in Northern Virginia, both of which handle more than twenty million passengers a year; [[Richmond International Airport|Richmond International]]; and [[Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport]] and [[Norfolk International Airport|Norfolk International]] serving the Hampton Roads area. Several other airports offer limited commercial passenger service, and sixty-six public airports serve the state's aviation needs. The [[Virginia Port Authority]]'s main seaports are those in [[Hampton Roads]], which carried of total cargo , the seventh most of United States ports. The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] is the site of [[Wallops Flight Facility]], a rocket testing center owned by [[NASA]], and the [[Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport]], a commercial spaceport. [[Space tourism]] is also offered through [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]]-based [[Space Adventures]].
Law and government.
[[File:MJK50147 Virginia State Capitol.jpg|thumb|The [[Virginia State Capitol]], designed by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Charles-Louis Clérisseau]], is home to the [[Virginia General Assembly]].|alt=All white Neoclassical building with pediment and six columns rises on a grassy hill with a large American elm tree in the left foreground. Two boxier, but similarly styled wings are attached at the building's rear.]]
In 1619, the first [[Virginia General Assembly]] met at [[Jamestown Church]], and included 22 locally elected representatives, making Virginia's legislature the oldest in the North America. The elected members became the [[House of Burgesses]] in 1642, and governed with the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Governor's Council]], which was appointed by the [[British monarchy]], until Virginia declared independence from Britain in 1776. The [[161st Virginia General Assembly|current General Assembly]] is the 161st since that year. The government today functions under the seventh [[Constitution of Virginia]], which was approved by voters in 1971 and is similar to the [[federal government of the United States|federal structure]] in that it provides for [[Separation of powers|three branches]]: a strong legislature, an executive, and a unified judicial system.
Virginia's legislature is bicameral with a 100-member [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] and 40-member [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]], who together write the laws for the Commonwealth. Delegates serve two-year terms, while senators serve four-year terms, with [[2019 Virginia elections|the most recent elections]] for both taking place in November 2019. The executive department includes the [[Governor of Virginia|governor]], [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]], and [[Attorney General of Virginia|attorney general]], who are elected every four years in separate elections, with the next taking place in [[2021 Virginia gubernatorial election|November 2021]]. The governor must be at least thirty years old and [[List of Virginia Governors|incumbent governors]] cannot run for re-election, however the lieutenant governor and attorney general can, and governors can and have served non-consecutive terms. The lieutenant governor is the official head of the Senate, and is responsible for breaking ties. The House elects a [[List of Speakers of the Virginia House of Delegates|Speaker of the House]] and the Senate elects a [[President pro tempore of the Senate of Virginia|President pro tempore]], who presides when the lieutenant governor isn't present, and both houses elect a clerk and majority and minority leaders. The governor also nominates their eleven [[Virginia Governor's Cabinet|cabinet members]] and others who head various state departments.
State budgets are proposed in even years by the governor. Based on data through 2018, the [[Pew Research Center|Pew Center on the States]] found Virginia's government to be above average in running surpluses, and "[[U.S. News and World Report]]" ranked the state eighteenth in [[Fiscal sustainability|fiscal stability]]. The legislature meets annually starting on the second Wednesday of the year, typically for 60 days in even years and 48 days in odd years due to the Commonwealth's biannual budgeting, though special sessions can be called either by the governor or with agreement of two-thirds of both houses. Special sessions were called in 2019 on gun control and in 2020 on [[police reform]] and the impact of the coronavirus on the state budget.
Judicial system.
[[File:SupremeCourtofVirginiaBuilding.JPG|thumb|Unlike the federal system, justices of the [[Supreme Court of Virginia|Virginia Supreme Court]] have term limits and a mandatory retirement age, and select their own Chief Justice.|alt=A seven-story sandstone building faced with ionic columns on a city street corner.]]
The judges and justices who make up [[Judiciary of Virginia|Virginia's judicial system]], also the oldest in America, are elected by a majority vote in both the House and Senate without input from the governor, one way Virginia's legislature is stronger than its executive. The system consists of a hierarchy from the [[Supreme Court of Virginia]] and the [[Court of Appeals of Virginia]] to the [[Virginia Circuit Court|Circuit Courts]], the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower [[Virginia General District Court|General District Courts]] and [[Virginia Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court|Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Courts]]. The Supreme Court has seven justices who serve twelve-year terms, with a [[mandatory retirement age]] of 73. The Supreme Court selects its own Chief Justice from among their seven members, who is informally limited to two four-year terms. Virginia was the last state to guarantee an automatic right of [[appeal]] for all civil and criminal cases, and their Court of Appears is increasing from eleven to seventeen judges in 2021.
The [[Code of Virginia]] is the statutory law, and consists of the codified legislation of the General Assembly. Virginia has no "[[pocket veto]]," and bills will become law if the governor chooses to neither approve nor veto legislation. The largest [[List of law enforcement agencies in Virginia|law enforcement agency in Virginia]] is the [[Virginia State Police]], with 3,022 sworn and civilian members . The [[Virginia Division of Capitol Police|Virginia Capitol Police]] protect the legislature and executive department, and are the oldest police department in the United States. The governor can also call upon the [[Virginia National Guard]], which consists of approximately [[Virginia Army National Guard|7,200 army soldiers]], [[Virginia Air National Guard|1,200 airmen]], [[Virginia Defense Force|300 Defense Force members]], and 400 civilians.
Virginia abolished the [[capital punishment in Virginia|death penalty in 2021]]. Over 1,300 people have been executed by the state since 1608, including [[List of people executed in Virginia|113 following the resumption of capital punishment]] in 1982. Virginia's prison system incarcerates 30,936 people , 53% of whom are Black, and the state has the sixteenth-highest [[List of U.S. states and territories by incarceration and correctional supervision rate|rate of incarceration in the country]], at 422 per 100,000 residents. Virginia ended prisoner parole in 1995. Virginia's rate of [[recidivism]] of released felons who are re-convicted within three years and sentenced to a year or more is 23.1%, the lowest in the country . Virginia has the fourth lowest violent crime rate and 13th-lowest property crime rate . Between 2008 and 2017, arrests for drug-related crimes rose 38%, with 71% of those related to [[Cannabis in Virginia|marijuana]], which Virginia [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|decriminalized]] in July 2020 and will [[Legality of cannabis by U.S. jurisdiction|legalize]] in July 2021.
Politics.
[[File:Shad Planking.jpg|thumb|Mirroring Virginia's political transition, the annual [[Shad Planking]] event in [[Wakefield, Virginia|Wakefield]] has evolved from a vestige of the [[Byrd Organization|Byrd era]] into a regular stop for many state campaigns.|alt=People stroll in a wooded area decorated with American flags.]]
Over the 20th century, Virginia shifted from a largely rural, [[Politics of the Southern United States|politically Southern]] and conservative state to a more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate environment as both greater enfranchisement and demographic shifts have changed the electorate. Up until the 1970s, Virginia was a racially divided [[Solid South|one-party state]] dominated by the [[Byrd Organization]]. They sought to stymie the political power of Northern Virginia, perpetuate [[Segregation in the United States|segregation]], and successfully restricted voter registration such that between 1905 and 1948, roughly one-third of votes in the state were cast by state employees and officeholders themselves, and [[voter turnout]] was regularly below ten percent. The organization used [[malapportionment]] to further control what areas of the Commonwealth were over-represented in the [[Virginia General Assembly|General Assembly]] and the U.S. Congress until ordered to end the practice by the 1964 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decision in "[[Davis v. Mann]]" and the 1965 [[Virginia Supreme Court]] decision in "Wilkins v. Davis" respectively.
Enforcement of federal civil rights legislation passed in the mid-1960s helped stop the state's [[Jim Crow laws]] that effectively [[disfranchisement|disfranchised]] African Americans, who have since become the most reliable bloc of Democratic voters. The [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] made Virginia one of nine states that were required to receive approval from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] for changes to voting laws until the system for including states was [[Shelby County v. Holder|struck down in 2013]]. A strict [[Voter identification laws in the United States|photo identification requirement]], added under Governor [[Bob McDonnell]] in 2014, was repealed in 2020, and the [[Voting Rights Act of Virginia]] was passed in 2021, requiring preclearance from the [[Attorney General of Virginia|state Attorney General]] for local election changes that could result in disenfranchisement, including closing or moving polling sites. Though many Jim Crow provisions were removed in Virginia's 1971 constitution, a lifetime [[Felony disenfranchisement in Virginia|ban on voting for felony convictions]] was unchanged, and by 2016, up to twenty percent of African Americans in Virginia were disenfranchised because of prior felonies. That year, Governor [[Terry McAuliffe]] ended the lifetime ban and individually restored voting rights to over 200,000 ex-felons.
Regional differences also play a large part in Virginia politics. While urban and growing suburban areas, including much of [[Northern Virginia]], form the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] [[base (politics)|base]], rural southern and western areas moved to support the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in response to its "[[southern strategy]]". Rural Democratic support has nevertheless persisted in union-influenced [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] in [[Southwest Virginia]], college towns such as [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]] and [[Blacksburg, Virginia|Blacksburg]], and the southeastern [[Black Belt in the American South|Black Belt Region]]. Educational attainment and gender have become strong indicators of political alignment, with the majority of women in Virginia supporting Democratic presidential candidates since 1980. Strong international immigration and domestic migration into the state have also increased the proportion of eligible voters born outside the state from 44% in 1980 to 55% in 2019.
State elections.
[[File:Virginia Delegates 2019.png|thumb|Democrats took control of the General Assembly in the [[Virginia elections, 2019|2019 state elections]].|alt=A map of Virginia showing the results of the 2019 Virginia House of Delegates election, with Republican districts in red and Democratic districts in blue, with heavier shading showing a larger margin of victory.]]
State elections in Virginia occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following U.S. presidential elections and [[Senate of Virginia|Senate]] elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections, as both have four-year terms. [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] elections take place concurrent with each of those elections as members have two-year terms. National politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and Virginia has elected governors of the party opposite the U.S. president in ten of the last eleven contests, with only [[Terry McAuliffe]] beating the trend.
McAuliffe, a Democrat, was elected Governor [[Virginia elections, 2013|in the 2013 elections]] by two percentage points during [[Barack Obama]]'s second presidential term. Republicans, however, held a super-majority (68–32) of seats in the House of Delegates, which they had first gained in [[2011 Virginia elections|the 2011 state elections]]. Republicans also held a one-vote majority the state senate, which they then maintained [[2015 Virginia elections|in the 2015 election]]. Eleven house district lines used in these elections, drawn following the [[2010 U.S. Census]], were [[Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections|later judged unconstitutional]] for discriminating against African Americans. The 2011 and 2015 elections also had the lowest [[voter turnout]] in recent history, with just 28.6% and 29.1% of registered voters participating respectively.
The [[Virginia elections, 2017|2017 statewide elections]] resulted in Democrats holding the three highest offices, with outgoing lieutenant governor [[Ralph Northam]] [[2017 Virginia gubernatorial election|winning the governorship]], [[Justin Fairfax]] [[2017 Virginia lieutenant gubernatorial election|elected lieutenant governor]], and [[Mark Herring]] [[2017 Virginia Attorney General election|continuing as attorney general]]. In concurrent [[Virginia House of Delegates elections, 2017|House of Delegates elections]], Democrats flipped fifteen of the Republicans' previous sixteen-seat majority. Control of the House came down to the tied election in the [[Virginia's 94th House of Delegates district|94th district]], which was won by Republicans through drawing of lots, giving the party a slim 51–49 majority in the 2018–19 legislative sessions. Despite [[2019 Virginia political crisis|a political crisis that February]], Democrats took full control of the General Assembly in the [[Virginia elections, 2019|November 2019 elections]], the first after several districts were redrawn because of discrimination. Voters in 2020 [[2020 Virginia Question 1|passed a referendum]] to give [[Redistricting in Virginia|control of drawing]] both congressional and state legislative districts to a commission of eight citizens and four legislators from each of the two major parties, rather than the legislature.
Federal elections.
[[File:Tim Kaine and Mark Warner 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Warner]] and [[Tim Kaine]], Virginia's two U.S. Senators, are both former governors.|alt=Two older white men in suits stand behind a podium while one talks.]]
Though Virginia was considered a "[[swing state]]" in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 presidential election]], Democratic candidates carried Virginia's thirteen [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in that election and the three since; Joe Biden carried Virginia by over ten points in 2020, suggesting the state has shifted to being reliably Democratic. Virginia had previously voted for Republican presidential candidates in thirteen out of fourteen [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] from 1952 to 2004, including ten in a row from 1968 to 2004, but hasn't voted for a Republican candidate statewide since 2009. Virginia currently holds its presidential primary election on [[Super Tuesday]], the same day as thirteen other states, with the most recent held on March 3, 2020.
In U.S. congressional elections since 2006, both parties have seen successes. Republican Senator [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] lost close races in [[Virginia United States Senate election, 2006|2006]], to Democratic newcomer [[Jim Webb]], and again in [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2012|2012]], to Webb's replacement, former Governor [[Tim Kaine]]. In [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 2008|2008]], Democrats won both [[United States Senate]] seats; former Governor [[Mark Warner]] was elected to replace retiring Republican [[John Warner]]. In the [[2010 United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia|2010 mid-term elections]], the first under President Obama, Republicans flipped three [[United States House of Representatives]] seats from the Democrats, while in the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia|2018 mid-terms]], the first under President Trump, Democrats flipped three seats from Republicans. Of the state's [[List of United States Representatives from Virginia|eleven seats]] in the House of Representatives, Democrats currently hold seven and Republicans hold four.
Sports.
[[File:2011 Monument Avenue 10k (5583061136).jpg|thumb|The annual [[Monument Avenue 10K]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] has become one of the ten largest timed races in the U.S.|alt=A large crowd runners in brightly colored shirts race down a wide street bordered by autumnal trees.]]
Virginia is the most populous U.S. state without a [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports league]] franchise. The reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state, a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums, and the proximity of [[Sports in Washington, D.C.|teams in Washington, D.C.]], [[Sports in Baltimore|Baltimore]], [[Sports in Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], and [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. A [[Virginia Beach Arena|proposed arena]] in [[Virginia Beach]] designed for an NBA franchise became the latest unsuccessful sports initiative when the city council there ended support in 2017. Virginia Beach had previously been considered for an NBA franchise in 1987, which ultimately became the [[Charlotte Hornets]]. The [[Virginia Squires]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] started in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] in 1970, but lost momentum after trading [[Julius Erving|"Dr. J" Julius Erving]] and folded just one month before the [[ABA–NBA merger]] in 1976.
Five [[minor league baseball]] and two mid-level hockey teams play in Virginia. Norfolk is host to two: The [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] [[Norfolk Tides]] and the [[ECHL]]'s [[Norfolk Admirals (ECHL)|Norfolk Admirals]]. The [[San Francisco Giants]]' [[Double-A (baseball)|AA team]], the [[Richmond Flying Squirrels]], began play at [[The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia)|The Diamond]] in 2010, replacing the AAA [[Richmond Braves]], who relocated after 2008. Additionally, the [[Washington Nationals]], [[Boston Red Sox]], and [[Cleveland Indians]] also have Single-A [[farm team]]s in Virginia. [[Loudoun United FC]], the reserve team of [[D.C. United]], debuted in the [[USL Championship]] in 2019, while the [[Richmond Kickers]] of the [[USL League One]] have operated since 1993 and are the only team in their league to win both the league championship and the [[U.S. Open Cup]] in the same year. The [[Washington Football Team]] also have their headquarters in [[Ashburn, Virginia|Ashburn]] and their training facility in Richmond, and the [[Washington Capitals]] practice at [[MedStar Capitals Iceplex]] in [[Ballston, Arlington, Virginia|Ballston]].
Virginia has many professional caliber golf courses including the [[Greg Norman]] course at Lasdowne Resort and Kingsmill Resort, home of the [[Kingsmill Championship]], an [[LPGA Tour]] tournament. [[NASCAR]] currently schedules [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy NASCAR Cup]] races on two tracks in Virginia: [[Martinsville Speedway]] and [[Richmond Raceway]]. Virginia natives currently competing in the series include [[Denny Hamlin]] and [[Elliott Sadler]]. [[Hampton Roads]] has produced several Olympic gold medalists, including [[Gabby Douglas]], the first African American to win [[Gymnastics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Women's artistic individual all-around|gymnastics individual all-around]] gold, and [[LaShawn Merritt]] and [[Francena McCorory]], who both helped the U.S. men's and women's [[4 × 400 metres relay]] teams to gold at the [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Rio games]]. Major long-distance races in the state include the [[Richmond Marathon]], the [[Blue Ridge Marathon on the Parkway]], and the [[Monument Avenue 10K]].
College sports.
[[File:VT - UVA 2012 - Waiting for the rebound.jpg|thumb|alt=A college basketball player dressed in white with orange and blue bordering prepares to shoot a free throw.|[[Mike Scott (basketball)|Mike Scott]] and [[Joe Harris (basketball)|Joe Harris]] of the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia Cavaliers]] battle [[Cadarian Raines]] of the [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech Hokies]] for a rebound at [[Cassell Coliseum]]]]
In the absence of professional sports, several of Virginia's collegiate sports programs have attracted strong followings, with a 2015 poll showing that 34% of Virginians were fans of the [[Virginia Cavaliers]] and 28% were fans of the [[Virginia-Virginia Tech rivalry|rival]] [[Virginia Tech Hokies]], making both more popular than the surveyed regional professional teams. The men's and women's [[college basketball]] programs of the [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Cavaliers]], [[VCU Rams men's basketball|VCU Rams]], and [[Old Dominion Monarchs basketball|Old Dominion Monarchs]] have combined for 63 regular season conference championships and 48 conference tournament championships between them . The [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]] football team sustained a 27-year bowl streak between 1993 and 2019; [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison Dukes]] football won [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] NCAA Championships in both 2004 and 2016. The overall UVA men's athletics programs won the national [[Capital One Cup (college sports)|Capital One Cup]] in [[Capital One Cup (college sports)#Champions|both 2015 and 2019]], and lead the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in [[Atlantic Coast Conference#NCAA team championships|NCAA championships]].
[[List of college athletic programs in Virginia#Division I|Fourteen universities]] in total compete in [[NCAA Division I]], with multiple programs each in the Atlantic Coast Conference, [[Atlantic 10 Conference]], [[Big South Conference]], and [[Colonial Athletic Association]]. Three [[historically black colleges and universities|historically Black schools]] compete in the Division II [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]], and two others ([[Hampton Pirates and Lady Pirates|Hampton]] and [[Norfolk State Spartans|Norfolk State]]) compete in Division I. Several smaller schools compete in the [[Old Dominion Athletic Conference]] and the [[USA South Athletic Conference]] of NCAA Division III. The NCAA currently holds its [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] [[NCAA Division III national football championship|championships in football]], men's basketball, volleyball, and softball in [[Salem, Virginia|Salem]]. Virginia does not allow state appropriated funds to be used for either operational or capital expenses for intercollegiate athletics.
High school sports.
Virginia is also home to several of the nation's top high school [[basketball]] programs, including [[Paul VI Catholic High School]] and [[Oak Hill Academy (Mouth of Wilson, Virginia)|Oak Hill Academy]], the latter of which has won nine national championships. In the 2018–2019 school year, 174,224 high school students participated in fourteen girls sports and thirteen boys sports managed by the [[Virginia High School League]], with the most popular sports for boys being [[High school football|football]] and [[High school soccer|soccer]], while soccer, outdoor track, and [[volleyball]] were most popular for girls. Youth soccer leagues outside of the high school system are also popular in the state, and 18 teams from Virginia have won national championships, seventh-most among U.S. states. Access to youth soccer in Virginia however has been found to be highly correlated to race and median household income, with opportunities almost completely disappearing in areas where the non-white population exceeded 90%, particularly in the [[Southwest Virginia|Southwest]] and [[Southside (Virginia)|Southside]] regions of the Commonwealth.
State symbols.
[[File:2017-06-12 15 45 41 'Welcome to Virginia' sign along eastbound U.S. Route 58 (Wilderness Road) entering Lee County, Virginia from Claiborne County, Tennessee crop.jpg|thumb|The state slogan, "[[Virginia is for Lovers]]", was developed in 1968 and is featured on the state's welcome signs.|alt=A large rectangular metal sign, mostly black, with the words "Welcome To Virginia" and "Virginia is for lovers" with a red heart symbol on the left.]]
The state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. Virginia was given the title "[[Dominion]]" by King [[Charles II of England]] at the time of [[Stuart Restoration|The Restoration]], because it had remained loyal to the crown during the [[English Civil War]], and the present moniker, "Old Dominion" is a reference to that title. Charles' supporters were called [[Cavalier]]s, and "The Cavalier State" nickname was popularized after the [[American Civil War]] to romanticize the antebellum period. Sports teams from the [[University of Virginia]] are called the [[Virginia Cavaliers|Cavaliers]]. The other nickname, "Mother of Presidents", is also historic, as eight Virginians have served as [[Lists of United States Presidents by place of birth#By state of birth|President of the United States]], including four of the first five.
The state's motto, "[[Sic semper tyrannis|Sic Semper Tyrannis]]", translates from Latin as "Thus Always to Tyrants", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. While the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930. The majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century. The [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia reel]] is among the [[square dance]]s classified as the [[List of U.S. state dances|state dance]]. In 1940, Virginia made "[[Carry Me Back to Old Virginny]]" the [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]], but it was retired in 1997 due to its references to slavery. In March 2015, Virginia named "[[Our Great Virginia]]", which uses the tune of "[[Oh Shenandoah]]", as the traditional state song and "[[Sweet Virginia Breeze]]" as the popular state song.
