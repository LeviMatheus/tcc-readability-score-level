Recipes.
According the "Larousse Gastronomique", a seminal work of French "haute cuisine", first published in 1938, Suprême sauce is made from the Mother sauce V"elouté" sauce ( White stock thickened with a white roux - in the case of S"uprême sauce", chicken stock is usually preferred), reduced with heavy cream or "crème fraîche", and then strained through a fine sieve.
A light squeeze of lemon juice is commonly added. In many cases, chefs also choose to add finely chopped and lightly sautéed mushrooms to the dish, although this was not specifically mentioned in "Larousse Gastronomique" or by Auguste Escoffier, the "Emperor of the World's Kitchens", who was an arbiter of classic French cuisine.
It is possible to make a similar sauce to pass for "sauce suprême" by taking béchamel sauce (a classic mother sauce made with butter, flour and milk), with a poultry stock (effectively a shortcut to making a "velouté" by combining the roux and stock elements) and butter.
"The Cook's Decameron" suggests the following recipe: the sauce is made by placing three-quarters of a pint of white sauce into a saucepan, and when it is nearly boiling, adding half a cup of concentrated fowl stock. It should then be reduced until the sauce is quite thick, passed through a "chinois" strainer into a "bain-marie" and have added two tablespoons of cream.
