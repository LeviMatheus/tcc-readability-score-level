AD 46 (XLVI) was a common year starting on Saturday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Asiaticus and Silanus (or, less frequently, year 799 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 46 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
