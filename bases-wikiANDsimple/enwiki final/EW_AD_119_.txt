Year 119 (CXIX) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Hadrianus and Rusticus (or, less frequently, year 872 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 119 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
