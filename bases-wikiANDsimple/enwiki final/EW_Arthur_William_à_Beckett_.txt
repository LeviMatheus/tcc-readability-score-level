Arthur William à Beckett (25 October 1844 – 14 January 1909) was an English journalist and intellectual.
Biography.
He was a younger son of Gilbert Abbott à Beckett and Mary Anne à Beckett, brother of Gilbert Arthur à Beckett and educated at Felsted School. Besides fulfilling other journalistic engagements, Beckett was on the staff of "Punch" from 1874 to 1902, edited the "Sunday Times" 1891–1895, and the "Naval and Military Magazine" in 1896.
He gave an account of his father and his own reminiscences in "The à Becketts of Punch" (1903). A childhood friend (and distant relative) of W. S. Gilbert, Beckett briefly feuded with Gilbert in 1869, but the two patched up the friendship, and Gilbert even later collaborated on projects with Beckett's brother.
He was married to Suzanne Frances Winslow, daughter of the noted psychiatrist Forbes Benignus Winslow.
