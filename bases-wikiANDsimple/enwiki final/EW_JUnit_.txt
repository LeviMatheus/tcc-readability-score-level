JUnit is a unit testing framework for the Java programming language. JUnit has been important in the development of test-driven development, and is one of a family of unit testing frameworks which is collectively known as xUnit that originated with SUnit.
JUnit is linked as a JAR at compile-time. The latest version of the framework, JUnit 5, resides under package codice_1. Previous versions JUnit 4 and JUnit 3 were under packages codice_2 and codice_3, respectively.
A research survey performed in 2013 across 10,000 Java projects hosted on GitHub found that JUnit (in a tie with slf4j-api), was the most commonly included external library. Each library was used by 30.7% of projects.
Example of JUnit test fixture.
A JUnit test fixture is a Java object. Test methods must be annotated by the codice_4 annotation. If the situation requires it, it is also possible to define a method to execute before (or after) each (or all) of the test methods with the codice_5 (or codice_6) and codice_7 (or codice_8) annotations.
import org.junit.jupiter.api.*;
public class FoobarTest {
 @BeforeAll
 public static void setUpClass() throws Exception {
 // Code executed before the first test method
 @BeforeEach
 public void setUp() throws Exception {
 // Code executed before each test
 
 @Test
 public void oneThing() {
 // Code that tests one thing
 @Test
 public void anotherThing() {
 // Code that tests another thing
 @Test
 public void somethingElse() {
 // Code that tests something else
 @AfterEach
 public void tearDown() throws Exception {
 // Code executed after each test 
 
 @AfterAll
 public static void tearDownClass() throws Exception {
 // Code executed after the last test method 
Previous versions of JUnit.
As a side effect of its wide use, previous versions of JUnit remain popular, with JUnit 4 having over a 100,000 usages by other software components on the Maven central repository.
In JUnit 4, the annotations for test execution callbacks were @BeforeClass, @Before, @After, and @AfterClass, as opposed to JUnit 5's @BeforeAll, @BeforeEach, @AfterEach, and @AfterAll.
In JUnit 3, test fixtures had to inherit from codice_9. Also, test methods had to be prefixed with 'test'.
