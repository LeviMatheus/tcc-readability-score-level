Pope-elect Stephen (died 25 March 752) was a Roman priest selected in March 752 to succeed Pope Zachary. Because he died before he was consecrated, he is considered only a rather than a legitimate pope.
Papacy.
In 745, Stephen was made a cardinal-priest by Pope Zachary. His titular church was San Crisogono. Zachary died in mid-March 752. On 23 March, Stephen was selected to become the new pope. He died of a stroke only days later, before being consecrated as bishop of Rome. 
According to the canon law of the time, a pope's pontificate started upon his consecration. Later canon law, in force until 1 October 1975, considered that a man became pope the moment he accepted his election, and Pope-elect Stephen was then anachronistically called Pope Stephen II. His name was removed from the list of popes in the "Annuario Pontificio" in 1961.
