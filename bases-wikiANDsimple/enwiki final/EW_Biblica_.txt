History.
Biblica was founded December 4, 1809, in New York City as the "New York Bible Society" by a small group including Henry Rutgers, William Colgate, Theodorus Van Wyke and Thomas Eddy.
Biblica experienced its first merger in 1819 when it merged with the "New York Auxiliary Bible Society". It was renamed "New York International Bible Society" in 1974, "International Bible Society" (IBS) in 1988. The organization moved to Colorado Springs from New York in 1988 and moved into its current facility in 1989. It merged with Living Bibles International in 1992 and International Bible Society and Send the Light (STL) in 2007, forming a new organization called "IBS-STL". In 2009, it adopted the name "Biblica".
Translations.
Biblica's international ministry began in 1810 with its sponsorship of William Careyâ€™s Bible translation work in India. The worldwide work expanded in 1992 following the merger with Living Bibles International, through which Biblica developed its global translation ministry. The reach of Biblica around the world again expanded through its merger with Send the Light (STL) in 2007.
Biblica is perhaps best known for its New International Version (NIV) version of the Bible, the best-selling contemporary English translation.
