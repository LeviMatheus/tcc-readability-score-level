The Togolese Armed Forces (French: "Forces Armées Togolaises", FAT) is the national military of the Republic of Togo which consists of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and the National Gendarmerie. The total military expenditure during the fiscal year of 2005 was 1.6% of the country's GDP. Military bases exist in Lomé, Temedja, Kara, Niamtougou, and Dapaong. The current Chief of the General Staff is Brigadier General Titikpina Atcha Mohamed, who took office on May 19, 2009.
Army.
The current chief of staff of the army is Colonel Blakimwé Wiyao Balli. The elite presidential bodyguards of the Republic of Togo Armed Forces are reportedly trained by Benjamin Yeaten, an internationally wanted Liberian military commander and war criminal.
Air Force.
The Republic of Togo Air Force (French: "Armée de l'Air Republic of Togo") was established in 1964, and French influence remains in the choice of aircraft used. Since 2005, the air force's chief of staff is Colonel Bouraïma Bonfoh.
The C-47 Skytrain was the first aircraft used; it was part of the force from 1960 to 1976. Replacing the C-47s were two DHC-5D Buffalo STOL transports in 1976. Also in the same year, Togo acquired five ex-German Air Force Fouga Magister armed jet trainers and seven EMB.326GBs from Brazil to form the Escadrille de Chasse. Togo's armed jet trainer fleet was upgraded in 1981 by the deliveries of five Alpha jets and by three piston engine Aerospatiale TB-30 Epsilons in 1986. The Fouga Magisters were returned to France in 1985.
During its existence the official name changed from "Section Air der Forces armées" in 1964 to "Escadrille Nationale Togolaise" (ENT) in 1973, to "Groupement Aerienne Togolais" (GAT) in 1980, and finally to "Armée de l'Air Togolaise" in 1997.
At present its operations are concentrated in the Lomé Transport Base at Lomé Tokoin Airport, where the transport aircraft are based, and the Niamtougou Fighter Base at Niamtougou International Airport, where the combat units are located.
Navy.
The National Navy was created on May 1, 1976 to guard the roughly 34 miles (55 km) of Republic of Togo coast and the seaport of Lomé. It currently has 2 wooden-hulled patrol boats, the "Kara" (P 761), and the "Mono" (P 762), which have both been in service since 1976. On 7 July 2014, the Republic of Togo navy received a RPB 33 patrol boat that was named "Agou" (P 763). Currently, the navy's chief of staff is ship captain Atiogbé Ametsipe.
