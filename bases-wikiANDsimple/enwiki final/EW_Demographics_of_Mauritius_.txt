This article is about the demographic features of the population of Mauritius, including population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.
Mauritian society includes people from many different ethnic groups. A majority of the republic's residents are the descendants of people from India. Mauritius also contains substantial populations from continental Africa, China, France, Great Britain, and the East African island nation of Madagascar.
Ethnic groups.
Indo-Mauritians make up approximately sixty-six percent of the population. The Indo-Mauritian population consists of Hindu and Muslim descendants of Indian labourers, with a small Christian community.
Mauritian Creoles (descendants of Africans) make up twenty-eight percent of the population. Nowadays, a significant proportion of them are predominantly black with varying amounts of French and Indian ancestry. Rodriguais and Chagossians are usually incorporated within the Creole ethnic group.
Franco-Mauritians (Mauritians of French ancestry) form around two percent of the population. They are descendants of French settlers, comprising the largest group of European origin. There is a smaller population of British descent, most of whom have been absorbed within the Franco-Mauritian community. There is also a considerable number of white foreign expatriates living in Mauritius, about 8000 from France and 2000 from South Africa. Along with the French European community, there is a small number of British expatriates or people of British descent in Mauritius.
Sino-Mauritians from the Hakka and other Chinese sub-ethnic/linguistic groups make up around three percent of Mauritian society.
While the government officially groups Mauritians in four ethnic groups – Hindus, Muslims, Chinese and general population – the general population includes all who do not practice the Hindu or Muslim religion, or are not Chinese by ethnicity. Hence the general population is the Christian community, which includes Black people, mixed people, white people, and those who have converted to Christianity. The exception is that the general population does not include the Christian Chinese, although most practice a mix of Christianity and traditional Chinese religions.
Small groups of foreign students from Europe or the Indian Ocean region are also present. Recent years have seen a steady flow of foreign workers into the textile industry (primarily Chinese women), the construction industry (primarily Indian workers), and harbour-related activities (primarily Taiwanese men). Immigration policy does not provoke much debate in Mauritius, and the relative economic stability of the island serves to attract foreign workers.

Language.
The main languages spoken in Mauritius are English, French, Mauritian Creole, and Bhojpuri. There is no official language. English is the official language of the parliament, though French is also permitted. However, the lingua franca is Mauritian Creole and the newspapers and television programs are usually in French.
Mauritian Creole, which is spoken by 90 percent of the population, is considered to be the native language of the country and is used most often in informal settings. It was developed in the 18th century by African slaves who used a pidgin language to communicate with each other as well as with their French masters, who did not understand the various African languages. The pidgin evolved with later generations to become a casual language. 
Mauritian Creole is a French-based creole.
