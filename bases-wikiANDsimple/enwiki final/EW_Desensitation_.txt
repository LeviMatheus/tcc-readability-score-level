In telecommunication, desensitation is the reduction of desired signal gain as a result of receiver reaction to an undesired signal. 
The gain reduction is generally due to overload of some portion of the receiver (e.g., the automatic gain control circuitry) resulting in suppression of the desired signal because the receiver will no longer respond linearly to incremental changes in input voltage.
