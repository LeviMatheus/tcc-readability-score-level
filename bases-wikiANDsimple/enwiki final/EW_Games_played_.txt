Games played (GP) is a statistic used in team sports to indicate the total number of games in which a player has participated (in any capacity); the statistic is generally applied irrespective of whatever portion of the game is contested.
Baseball.
In baseball, the statistic applies to players, who prior to a game, are included on a starting lineup card or are announced as an "ex ante" substitute, whether or not they play, although, in Major League Baseball, the application of this statistic doesn't extend to consecutive games played streaks. A starting pitcher, then, may be credited with a game played even as he is not credited with a game started or an inning pitched. For pitchers only, the statistic games pitched is used.
Association Football.
In Association Football, a game played is counted if a player is in the Starting XI, or if they come off the bench before full-time.
