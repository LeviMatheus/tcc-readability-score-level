A home page (or homepage) is the main web page of a website.
The term also refers to one or more pages always shown in a web browser when the application starts up. In this case, it is also known as the start page.
The word "home" comes from the use of the Home key on a keyboard to return to the start page at any time. (Home was a standard key long before the Web existed.) Many browsers also provide a button in the shape of a house for this.
Website home page.
A home page is generally the primary web page a visitor navigating to a website from a search engine will see, and it may also serve as a landing page to attract visitors. Thus good home page design is usually a high priority for a website. For example, a news website may present headlines and first paragraphs of top stories, with links to full articles.
In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages. Wikipedia, for example, has a site directory at wikipedia.org that links to every language-specific home page, including en.wikipedia.org.
Browser home page.
When a web browser is launched, it will automatically open at least one web page. This is the browser's home page, which is also called its start page.
Start pages can be a website or a special browser page, such as thumbnails of frequently visited websites. Moreover, there is a niche market of websites intended to be used solely as start pages.
