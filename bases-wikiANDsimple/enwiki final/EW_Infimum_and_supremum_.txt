In mathematics, the infimum (abbreviated inf; plural infima) of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_2 is the greatest element in formula_2 that is less than or equal to all elements of formula_4 if such an element exists. Consequently, the term "greatest lower bound" (abbreviated as "GLB") is also commonly used.
The supremum (abbreviated sup; plural suprema) of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_2 is the least element in formula_2 that is greater than or equal to all elements of formula_4 if such an element exists. Consequently, the supremum is also referred to as the "least upper bound" (or "LUB").
The infimum is in a precise sense dual to the concept of a supremum. Infima and suprema of real numbers are common special cases that are important in analysis, and especially in Lebesgue integration. However, the general definitions remain valid in the more abstract setting of order theory where arbitrary partially ordered sets are considered.
The concepts of infimum and supremum are similar to minimum and maximum, but are more useful in analysis because they better characterize special sets which may have . For instance, the set of positive real numbers formula_9 (not including 0) does not have a minimum, because any given element of formula_9 could simply be divided in half resulting in a smaller number that is still in formula_9. There is, however, exactly one infimum of the positive real numbers: 0, which is smaller than all the positive real numbers and greater than any other real number which could be used as a lower bound.
Formal definition.
A of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_13 is an element formula_14 of formula_15 such that
A lower bound formula_14 of formula_1 is called an (or , or ) of formula_1 if
Similarly, an of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_13 is an element formula_28 of formula_15 such that
An upper bound formula_28 of formula_1 is called a (or , or ) of formula_1 if
Existence and uniqueness.
Infima and suprema do not necessarily exist. Existence of an infimum of a subset formula_1 of formula_15 can fail if formula_1 has no lower bound at all, or if the set of lower bounds does not contain a greatest element. However, if an infimum or supremum does exist, it is unique.
Consequently, partially ordered sets for which certain infima are known to exist become especially interesting. For instance, a lattice is a partially ordered set in which all subsets have both a supremum and an infimum, and a complete lattice is a partially ordered set in which subsets have both a supremum and an infimum. More information on the various classes of partially ordered sets that arise from such considerations are found in the article on completeness properties.
If the supremum of a subset formula_1 exists, it is unique. If formula_1 contains a greatest element, then that element is the supremum; otherwise, the supremum does not belong to formula_1 (or does not exist). Likewise, if the infimum exists, it is unique. If formula_1 contains a least element, then that element is the infimum; otherwise, the infimum does not belong to formula_1 (or does not exist).
Relation to maximum and minimum elements.
The infimum of a subset formula_1 of a partially ordered set formula_23 assuming it exists, does not necessarily belong to formula_50 If it does, it is a minimum or least element of formula_50 Similarly, if the supremum of formula_1 belongs to formula_4 it is a maximum or greatest element of formula_50
For example, consider the set of negative real numbers (excluding zero). This set has no greatest element, since for every element of the set, there is another, larger, element. For instance, for any negative real number formula_55 there is another negative real number formula_56, which is greater. On the other hand, every real number greater than or equal to zero is certainly an upper bound on this set. Hence, 0 is the least upper bound of the negative reals, so the supremum is 0. This set has a supremum but no greatest element.
However, the definition of maximal and minimal elements is more general. In particular, a set can have many maximal and minimal elements, whereas infima and suprema are unique.
Whereas maxima and minima must be members of the subset that is under consideration, the infimum and supremum of a subset need not be members of that subset themselves.
Minimal upper bounds.
Finally, a partially ordered set may have many minimal upper bounds without having a least upper bound. Minimal upper bounds are those upper bounds for which there is no strictly smaller element that also is an upper bound. This does not say that each minimal upper bound is smaller than all other upper bounds, it merely is not greater. The distinction between "minimal" and "least" is only possible when the given order is not a total one. In a totally ordered set, like the real numbers, the concepts are the same.
As an example, let formula_1 be the set of all finite subsets of natural numbers and consider the partially ordered set obtained by taking all sets from formula_1 together with the set of integers formula_59 and the set of positive real numbers formula_9, ordered by subset inclusion as above. Then clearly both formula_59 and formula_9 are greater than all finite sets of natural numbers. Yet, neither is formula_9 smaller than formula_59 nor is the converse true: both sets are minimal upper bounds but none is a supremum.
Least-upper-bound property.
The is an example of the aforementioned completeness properties which is typical for the set of real numbers. This property is sometimes called .
If an ordered set formula_1 has the property that every nonempty subset of formula_1 having an upper bound also has a least upper bound, then formula_1 is said to have the least-upper-bound property. As noted above, the set formula_68 of all real numbers has the least-upper-bound property. Similarly, the set formula_59 of integers has the least-upper-bound property; if formula_1 is a nonempty subset of formula_59 and there is some number formula_72 such that every element formula_73 of formula_1 is less than or equal to formula_75 then there is a least upper bound formula_76 for formula_4 an integer that is an upper bound for formula_1 and is less than or equal to every other upper bound for formula_50 A well-ordered set also has the least-upper-bound property, and the empty subset has also a least upper bound: the minimum of the whole set.
An example of a set that the least-upper-bound property is formula_80, the set of rational numbers. Let formula_1 be the set of all rational numbers formula_82 such that formula_83 Then formula_1 has an upper bound (formula_85 for example, or formula_86) but no least upper bound in formula_80: If we suppose formula_88 is the least upper bound, a contradiction is immediately deduced because between any two reals formula_89 and formula_21 (including formula_91 and formula_92) there exists some rational formula_92, which itself would have to be the least upper bound (if formula_94) or a member of formula_1 greater than formula_92 (if formula_97). Another example is the hyperreals; there is no least upper bound of the set of positive infinitesimals.
There is a corresponding ; an ordered set possesses the greatest-lower-bound property if and only if it also possesses the least-upper-bound property; the least-upper-bound of the set of lower bounds of a set is the greatest-lower-bound, and the greatest-lower-bound of the set of upper bounds of a set is the least-upper-bound of the set.
If in a partially ordered set formula_15 every bounded subset has a supremum, this applies also, for any set formula_99 in the function space containing all functions from formula_100 to formula_23 where formula_102 if and only if formula_103 for all formula_89 in formula_105 For example, it applies for real functions, and, since these can be considered special cases of functions, for real formula_72-tuples and sequences of real numbers.
The least-upper-bound property is an indicator of the suprema.
Infima and suprema of real numbers.
In analysis, infima and suprema of subsets formula_1 of the real numbers are particularly important. For instance, the negative real numbers do not have a greatest element, and their supremum is formula_108 (which is not a negative real number).
The completeness of the real numbers implies (and is equivalent to) that any bounded nonempty subset formula_1 of the real numbers has an infimum and a supremum. If formula_1 is not bounded below, one often formally writes formula_111 If formula_1 is empty, one writes formula_113
Properties.
The following formulas depend on a notation that conveniently generalizes arithmetic operations on sets: Let the sets formula_114 and scalar formula_115 Define
In those cases where the infima and suprema of the sets formula_122 and formula_123 exist, the following identities hold:
Duality.
If one denotes by formula_161 the partially-ordered set formula_15 with the opposite order relation, i.e.
then infimum of a subset formula_1 in formula_15 equals the supremum of formula_1 in formula_161 and vice versa.
For subsets of the real numbers, another kind of duality holds: inf S = −sup(−"S"), where formula_171
Examples.
Suprema.
In the last example, the supremum of a set of rationals is irrational, which means that the rationals are incomplete.
One basic property of the supremum is
for any functionals formula_181 and formula_182
The supremum of a subset formula_1 of (ℕ,|) where | denotes "divides", is the lowest common multiple of the elements of formula_50
The supremum of a subset formula_1 of ("P",⊆), where formula_15 is the power set of some set, is the supremum with respect to ⊆ (subset) of a subset formula_1 of formula_15 is the union of the elements of formula_50
