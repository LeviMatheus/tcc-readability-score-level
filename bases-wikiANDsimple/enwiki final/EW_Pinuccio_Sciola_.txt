Pinuccio Sciola (15 March 1942 â€“ 13 May 2016) was an Italian sculptor and muralist from San Sperate, Sardinia. His work has been mentioned as a major attraction of the nearby town of Assemini. His work has also been exhibited in Alghero.
Forms in which he worked include "pietre sonore" or "sounding stones": large sculptures (mainly limestones or basalts) that resonate when rubbed by human hands or small rocks.
