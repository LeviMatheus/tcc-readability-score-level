Jesse Bonds Weaver Jr. (born June 22, 1962), better known by the stage name Schoolly D (sometimes spelled Schooly D), is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Career.
Schoolly D teamed up with DJ Code Money in the mid-1980s. His lyrics reflected urban realism, violence, and sexual bravado. He was interviewed in the 1986 documentary "Big Fun in the Big Town". He later embraced an Afrocentric style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with KRS-One.
Schoolly D contributed songs and music to many Abel Ferrara films, including "P.S.K." and "Saturday Night" (from "Saturday Night! â€“ The Album") as well as "King of New York" to Ferrara's film of the same name and the title track from "Am I Black Enough For You?" that was played during the climactic shoot-out in that film, the title track from "How a Black Man Feels", and "Signifying Rapper" (from "Smoke Some Kill"), which was used in Ferrara's film "Bad Lieutenant". Because Led Zeppelin successfully sued due to an uncleared interpolation of its song "Kashmir" in "Signifying Rapper", the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.
Composer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record "The Player" for Ferrara's film "The Blackout", which Delia scored. Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara's "'R Xmas". In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller "Order of the Quest" with Chuck Treece. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His last album, "Funk 'N Pussy", on Jeff "Met" Thies' Chord Recordings features guest appearances by Public Enemy's Chuck D, Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a drum and bass remix of the classic Schoolly D track "Mr. Big Dick" (remixed by UK trip hop crew The Sneaker Pimps).
Schoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the cult animated series "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" on the Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming block. He was a guest on a first season episode of "Space Ghost Coast to Coast". He also created the song "Sharkian Nights" for the Adult Swim series "12 oz. Mouse". The character Jesse B. Weaver from "The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show" was also named after him.
In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for "Aqua Teen Hunger Force", however, did not file the copyright to the Library of Congress until May 2006, after the series' fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive $150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filed, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series' DVDs be impounded and for "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" to cease broadcast.
Legacy.
