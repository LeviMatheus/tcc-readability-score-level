Micah (; ) is a given name.
Micah is the name of several people in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), and means "Who is like God?" The name is sometimes found with theophoric extensions. Suffix theophory in "Yah" and in "Yahweh" results in Michaiah or Michaihu (), meaning "who is like Yahweh?" Suffix theophory in "El" results in "Michael" (), meaning "who is like god".
In German and Dutch, Micah is spelled and the "ch" in the name is pronounced either or ; the first is more common in female names, the latter in male names. The name is not as common as Michael or Michiel.
