Character biography.
In the "Star Trek" universe, Kathryn Janeway was born on May 20, 2336 in Bloomington, Indiana on Earth. She was the daughter of Vice Admiral Janeway and has a sister named Phoebe, who is the artist in the family. Phoebe never chose to join Starfleet and stayed close to home with her mother, Gretchen Janeway. Kathryn Janeway was very close to her father, who taught her to look at the universe with a scientist's eye; she was devastated by his death. Her first mission after graduating the academy was as a science officer on the USS "Al-Batani", where she served as Chief Science Officer during the Arias mission.
Captain Janeway takes command of the "Intrepid"-class USS "Voyager" in 2371. Their first mission is to locate and capture a Maquis vessel last seen in the area of space known as the Badlands. While there, the Maquis ship and "Voyager" are transported against their will into the Delta Quadrant, 70,000 light-years away, by a massive displacement wave. The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and although "Voyager" survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect the Ocampa, who live on a planet "Voyager" visits, Janeway destroys the Caretaker Array, the space station that transported the two ships to the Delta Quadrant, which provides energy to the Ocampa's planet, despite the fact that the Array may be the two ships' only chance to return home. In doing this, Janeway strands her ship and crew seven decades' travel from home.
Her first major task is integrating the surviving Maquis and "Voyager" crews. Chakotay, captain of the Maquis ship, succeeds the deceased Lieutenant Commander Cavit as her first officer. Janeway also grants convicted criminal, former Starfleet officer, and accomplished pilot Tom Paris a field commission, and makes him "Voyager"s helmsman.
Janeway's other interactions with her crew include helping the de-assimilated Borg Seven of Nine reclaim her individuality and humanity and advocating for the 's status as a sentient being.
During the course of the TV series, "Voyager" has contact with the Q Continuum on three occasions, and repeated contact with the Borg. With the intervention of a future/alternate version of herself, Janeway leads her crew in using one of the Borg's transwarp conduits to return her ship to Federation space after having traveled through the Delta Quadrant for seven years.
In a cameo in the film "", now-Admiral Janeway instructs Captain Jean-Luc Picard to travel to Romulus at the invitation of the film's antagonist.

At the ride's end, Janeway tells the participants, "Congratulations. You've defeated the Borg with one thing the Queen can never assimilate: the human spirit. As long as we have that, resistance will never be futile."

During a brief moment of contact, Janeway helps them destroy the Borg cube, with all hands on board. Although Seven manages to escape, Janeway is killed. Her memorial service sees a vast turnout, and a tall gleaming pillar with a light burning atop it is constructed in tribute to her. The Q female appears to Janeway's spirit, and tells her that Q and the Q Continuum had taken an interest in her. Telling her that she has a destiny, Lady Q takes Janeway by the hand, and disappears with her into realms unknown. Writer Peter David explained the book was conceived by Pocket Books editorial as one in which Janeway would die, and that he was brought in to write it in order to give her a reportedly heroic send-off.

Birthplace monument.
In 2019, three disconnected groups of Bloomington, Indiana residents joined the Janeway Collective with the goal of building a birthplace monument such as the one existing for James T. Kirk in Riverside, Iowa. The monument was to be located on the B-Line Trail immediately next to the WonderLab science museum. Through attending local events and raising awareness, they were able to successfully raise funds through a crowdsourcing campaign on the platform Patronicity and received a matching grant from the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority's CreatINg Place program. The group worked directly with CBS to receive approvals for the likeness of the character and use of Star Trek symbolism.
The monument is constructed of a cast bronze bust with a limestone base with stainless steel plate. From above the monument has the appearance of a comm badge.
Initially, the birthplace monument was to be unveiled on May 23, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic it was rescheduled for October 24, 2020. An official groundbreaking event took place on June 27, 2020, Kate Mulgrew attended the unveiling virtually due to the pandemic.
