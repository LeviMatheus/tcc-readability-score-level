In a radio antenna pattern, the half power beam width is the angle between the half-power (-3 dB) points of the main lobe, when referenced to the peak effective radiated power of the main lobe. See beam diameter.
Beamwidth is usually but not always expressed in degrees and for the horizontal plane.
The beamwidth can be computed for arbitrary antenna arrays. Defining the array manifold as the complex response of the formula_1 element antenna array as formula_2, where formula_2 is a matrix with formula_1 rows, the beam pattern is first computed as:
where formula_6 is the conjugate transpose of formula_7 at the reference angle formula_8.
From the beam pattern formula_9, the antenna power is computed as:
The half power beamwidth (HPBW) is then found as the range of formula_11 where formula_12.
Note that other definitions of beamwidth exist, such as the distance between nulls and distance between first side lobes.
