Zechariah was a person in the Hebrew Bible and traditionally considered the author of the Book of Zechariah, the eleventh of the Twelve Minor Prophets.
Prophet.
The Book of Zechariah introduces him as the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo (). The Book of Ezra names Zechariah as the son of Iddo ( and ), but it is likely that Berechiah was Zechariah's father, and Iddo was his grandfather. 
His prophetical career probably began in the second year of Darius the Great, king of the Achaemenid Empire (520 BC). His greatest concern appears to have been with the building of the Second Temple.
He was probably not the "Zechariah" mentioned by Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew () and the Gospel of Luke (); Zechariah ben Jehoiada was more likely intended.
Bahá'í Faith.
Bahá'í teachers have made comparisons between the prophecies of Zechariah and the "Súriy-i-Haykal" in the Summons of the Lord of Hosts, a collection of the Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh.
Liturgical commemoration.
On the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, his feast day is February 8. He is commemorated with the other Minor Prophets in the calendar of saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church on July 31. The Roman Catholic Church honors him with a feast day assigned to September 6.
