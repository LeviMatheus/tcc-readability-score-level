AD 12 (XII) was a leap year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Capito (or, less frequently, year 765 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 12 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
