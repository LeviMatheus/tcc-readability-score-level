In geometry, a hypercube is an "n"-dimensional analogue of a square () and a cube (). It is a closed, compact, convex figure whose 1-skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space's dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length. A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in "n" dimensions is equal to formula_1.
An "n"-dimensional hypercube is more commonly referred to as an n"-cube or sometimes as an n"-dimensional cube. The term measure polytope (originally from Elte, 1912) is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter who also labels the hypercubes the γ polytopes.
The hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle (also called an "n-orthotope").
A "unit hypercube" is a hypercube whose side has length one unit. Often, the hypercube whose corners (or "vertices") are the 2"n" points in R"n" with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called "the" unit hypercube.
Construction.
A hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:
This can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a Minkowski sum: the "d"-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of "d" mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a zonotope.
The 1-skeleton of a hypercube is a hypercube graph.
Vertex coordinates.
A unit hypercube of dimension formula_2 is the convex hull of all the points whose formula_2 Cartesian coordinates are each equal to either formula_4 or formula_5. This hypercube is also the cartesian product formula_6 of formula_2 copies of the unit interval formula_8. Another unit hypercube, centered at the origin of the ambient space, can be obtained from this one by a translation. It is the convex hull of the points whose vector of Cartesian coordinates are
Here the symbol formula_10 means that each coordinate is either equal to formula_11 or to formula_12. This unit hypercube is also the cartesian product formula_13. Any unit hypercube has an edge length of formula_5 and an formula_2-dimensional volume of formula_5.
The formula_2-dimensional hypercube obtained as the convex hull of the points with coordinates formula_18 or, equivalently as the Cartesian product formula_19 is also often considered due to the simpler form of its vertex coordinates. Its edge length is formula_20, and its formula_2-dimensional volume is formula_22.
Faces.
Every hypercube admits, as its faces, hypercubes of a lower dimension contained in its boundary. A hypercube of dimension formula_2 admits formula_24 facets, or faces of dimension formula_25: a (formula_5-dimensional) line segment has formula_20 endpoints; a (formula_20-dimensional) square has formula_29 sides or edges; a formula_30-dimensional cube has formula_31 square faces; a (formula_29-dimensional) tesseract has formula_33 three-dimensional cube as its facets. The number of vertices of a hypercube of dimension formula_2 is formula_22 (a usual, formula_30-dimensional cube has formula_37 vertices, for instance).
The number of the formula_38-dimensional hypercubes (just referred to as formula_38-cubes from here on) contained in the boundary of an formula_2-cube is
For example, the boundary of a formula_29-cube (formula_46) contains formula_33 cubes (formula_30-cubes), formula_49 squares (formula_20-cubes), formula_51 line segments (formula_5-cubes) and formula_53 vertices (formula_4-cubes). This identity can be proven by a simple combinatorial argument: for each of the formula_22 vertices of the hypercube, there are formula_56 ways to choose a collection of formula_38 edges incident to that vertex. Each of these collections defines one of the formula_38-dimensional faces incident to the considered vertex. Doing this for all the vertices of the hypercube, each of the formula_38-dimensional faces of the hypercube is counted formula_60 times since it has that many vertices, and we need to divide formula_61 by this number.
The number of facets of the hypercube can be used to compute the formula_62-dimensional volume of its boundary: that volume is formula_24 times the volume of a formula_62-dimensional hypercube; that is, formula_65 where formula_66 is the length of the edges of the hypercube.
These numbers can also be generated by the linear recurrence relation
For example, extending a square via its 4 vertices adds one extra line segment (edge) per vertex. Adding the opposite square to form a cube provides formula_73 line segments.
Graphs.
An "n"-cube can be projected inside a regular 2"n"-gonal polygon by a skew orthogonal projection, shown here from the line segment to the 15-cube.
Related families of polytopes.
The hypercubes are one of the few families of regular polytopes that are represented in any number of dimensions.
The hypercube (offset) family is one of three regular polytope families, labeled by Coxeter as "γn". The other two are the hypercube dual family, the cross-polytopes, labeled as "βn," and the simplices, labeled as "αn". A fourth family, the infinite tessellations of hypercubes, he labeled as "δn".
Another related family of semiregular and uniform polytopes is the demihypercubes, which are constructed from hypercubes with alternate vertices deleted and simplex facets added in the gaps, labeled as "hγn".
"n"-cubes can be combined with their duals (the cross-polytopes) to form compound polytopes:
Relation to ("n"−1)-simplices.
The graph of the "n"-hypercube's edges is isomorphic to the Hasse diagram of the ("n"−1)-simplex's face lattice. This can be seen by orienting the "n"-hypercube so that two opposite vertices lie vertically, corresponding to the ("n"-1)-simplex itself and the null polytope, respectively. Each vertex connected to the top vertex then uniquely maps to one of the ("n"-1)-simplex's facets ("n"-2 faces), and each vertex connected to those vertices maps to one of the simplex's "n"-3 faces, and so forth, and the vertices connected to the bottom vertex map to the simplex's vertices.
This relation may be used to generate the face lattice of an ("n-1")-simplex efficiently, since face lattice enumeration algorithms applicable to general polytopes are more computationally expensive.
Generalized hypercubes.
Regular complex polytopes can be defined in complex Hilbert space called "generalized hypercubes", γ = "p"{4}2{3}...2{3}2, or ... Real solutions exist with "p"=2, i.e. γ = γ"n" = 2{4}2{3}...2{3}2 = {4,3..,3}. For "p"&gt;2, they exist in formula_74. The facets are generalized ("n"-1)-cube and the vertex figure are regular simplexes.
The regular polygon perimeter seen in these orthogonal projections is called a petrie polygon. The generalized squares (n=2) are shown with edges outlined as red and blue alternating color "p"-edges, while the higher n-cubes are drawn with black outlined "p"-edges.
The number of "m"-face elements in a "p"-generalized "n"-cube are: formula_75. This is "p""n" vertices and "pn" facets.
