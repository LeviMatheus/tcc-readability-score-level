In mathematics, the tangent space of a manifold facilitates the generalization of vectors from affine spaces to general manifolds, since in the latter case one cannot simply subtract two points to obtain a vector that gives the displacement of the one point from the other.
Informal description.
In differential geometry, one can attach to every point formula_1 of a differentiable manifold a "tangent space"â€”a real vector space that intuitively contains the possible directions in which one can tangentially pass through formula_1. The elements of the tangent space at formula_1 are called the "tangent vectors" at formula_1. This is a generalization of the notion of a bound vector in a Euclidean space. The dimension of the tangent space at every point of a connected manifold is the same as that of the manifold itself.
For example, if the given manifold is a formula_5-sphere, then one can picture the tangent space at a point as the plane that touches the sphere at that point and is perpendicular to the sphere's radius through the point. More generally, if a given manifold is thought of as an embedded submanifold of Euclidean space, then one can picture a tangent space in this literal fashion. This was the traditional approach toward defining parallel transport. Many authors in differential geometry and general relativity use it. More strictly, this defines an affine tangent space, which is distinct from the space of tangent vectors described by modern terminology.
In algebraic geometry, in contrast, there is an intrinsic definition of the "tangent space at a point" of an algebraic variety formula_6 that gives a vector space with dimension at least that of formula_6 itself. The points formula_8 at which the dimension of the tangent space is exactly that of formula_6 are called "non-singular" points; the others are called "singular" points. For example, a curve that crosses itself does not have a unique tangent line at that point. The singular points of formula_6 are those where the "test to be a manifold" fails. See Zariski tangent space.
Once the tangent spaces of a manifold have been introduced, one can define vector fields, which are abstractions of the velocity field of particles moving in space. A vector field attaches to every point of the manifold a vector from the tangent space at that point, in a smooth manner. Such a vector field serves to define a generalized ordinary differential equation on a manifold: A solution to such a differential equation is a differentiable curve on the manifold whose derivative at any point is equal to the tangent vector attached to that point by the vector field.
All the tangent spaces of a manifold may be "glued together" to form a new differentiable manifold with twice the dimension of the original manifold, called the "tangent bundle" of the manifold.
Formal definitions.
The informal description above relies on a manifold's ability to be embedded into an ambient vector space formula_11 so that the tangent vectors can "stick out" of the manifold into the ambient space. However, it is more convenient to define the notion of a tangent space based solely on the manifold itself.
There are various equivalent ways of defining the tangent spaces of a manifold. While the definition via the velocity of curves is intuitively the simplest, it is also the most cumbersome to work with. More elegant and abstract approaches are described below.
Definition via tangent curves.
In the embedded-manifold picture, a tangent vector at a point formula_1 is thought of as the "velocity" of a curve passing through the point formula_1. We can therefore define a tangent vector as an equivalence class of curves passing through formula_1 while being tangent to each other at formula_1.
Suppose that formula_16 is a formula_17 differentiable manifold (with smoothness formula_18) and that formula_19. Pick a coordinate chart formula_20, where formula_21 is an open subset of formula_16 containing formula_1. Suppose further that two curves formula_24 with formula_25 are given such that both formula_26 are differentiable in the ordinary sense (we call these "differentiable curves initialized at formula_1"). Then formula_28 and formula_29 are said to be "equivalent" at formula_30 if and only if the derivatives of formula_31 and formula_32 at formula_30 coincide. This defines an equivalence relation on the set of all differentiable curves initialized at formula_1, and equivalence classes of such curves are known as "tangent vectors" of formula_16 at formula_1. The equivalence class of any such curve formula_37 is denoted by formula_38. The "tangent space" of formula_16 at formula_1, denoted by formula_41, is then defined as the set of all tangent vectors at formula_1; it does not depend on the choice of coordinate chart formula_20.
To define vector-space operations on formula_41, we use a chart formula_20 and define a map formula_46 by formula_47 where formula_48. Again, one needs to check that this construction does not depend on the particular chart formula_20 and the curve formula_37 being used, and in fact it does not.
The map formula_51 turns out to be bijective and may be used to transfer the vector-space operations on formula_52 over to formula_41, thus turning the latter set into an formula_54-dimensional real vector space.
Definition via derivations.
Suppose now that formula_16 is a formula_56 manifold. A real-valued function formula_57 is said to belong to formula_58 if and only if for every coordinate chart formula_20, the map formula_60 is infinitely differentiable. Note that formula_58 is a real associative algebra with respect to the pointwise product and sum of functions and scalar multiplication.
Pick a point formula_19. A "derivation" at formula_1 is defined as a linear map formula_64 that satisfies the Leibniz identity
which is modeled on the product rule of calculus.
(For every identically constant function formula_66 it follows that formula_67).
If we define addition and scalar multiplication on the set of derivations at formula_1 by
then we obtain a real vector space, which we define as the tangent space formula_41 of formula_16 at formula_1.
Generalizations.
Generalizations of this definition are possible, for instance, to complex manifolds and algebraic varieties. However, instead of examining derivations formula_74 from the full algebra of functions, one must instead work at the level of germs of functions. The reason for this is that the structure sheaf may not be fine for such structures. For example, let formula_75 be an algebraic variety with structure sheaf formula_76. Then the Zariski tangent space at a point formula_77 is the collection of all formula_78-derivations formula_79, where formula_78 is the ground field and formula_81 is the stalk of formula_76 at formula_8.
Equivalence of the definitions.
For formula_84 and a differentiable curve formula_85 such that formula_86 define formula_87 (where the derivative is taken in the ordinary sense because formula_88 is a function from formula_89 to formula_90). One can ascertain that formula_91 is a derivation at the point formula_92 and that equivalent curves yield the same derivation. Thus, for an equivalence class formula_93 we can define formula_94 where the curve formula_48 has been chosen arbitrarily. The map formula_96 is a vector space isomorphism between the space of the equivalence classes formula_38 and that of the derivations at the point formula_98
Definition via cotangent spaces.
Again, we start with a formula_99 manifold formula_16 and a point formula_19. Consider the ideal formula_102 of formula_103 that consists of all smooth functions formula_104 vanishing at formula_1, i.e., formula_106. Then formula_102 and formula_108 are real vector spaces, and formula_109 may be defined as the dual space of the quotient space formula_110. This latter quotient space is also known as the "cotangent space" of formula_16 at formula_1.
While this definition is the most abstract, it is also the one that is most easily transferable to other settings, for instance, to the varieties considered in algebraic geometry.
If formula_74 is a derivation at formula_1, then formula_115 for every formula_116, which means that formula_74 gives rise to a linear map formula_118. Conversely, if formula_119 is a linear map, then formula_120 defines a derivation at formula_1. This yields an equivalence between tangent spaces defined via derivations and tangent spaces defined via cotangent spaces.
Properties.
If formula_16 is an open subset of formula_52, then formula_16 is a formula_56 manifold in a natural manner (take coordinate charts to be identity maps on open subsets of formula_52), and the tangent spaces are all naturally identified with formula_52.
Tangent vectors as directional derivatives.
Another way to think about tangent vectors is as directional derivatives. Given a vector formula_128 in formula_52, one defines the corresponding directional derivative at a point formula_130 by
This map is naturally a derivation at formula_1. Furthermore, every derivation at a point in formula_52 is of this form. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between vectors (thought of as tangent vectors at a point) and derivations at a point.
As tangent vectors to a general manifold at a point can be defined as derivations at that point, it is natural to think of them as directional derivatives. Specifically, if formula_128 is a tangent vector to formula_16 at a point formula_1 (thought of as a derivation), then define the directional derivative formula_137 in the direction formula_128 by
If we think of formula_128 as the initial velocity of a differentiable curve formula_37 initialized at formula_1, i.e., formula_143, then instead, define formula_137 by
Basis of the tangent space at a point.
For a formula_56 manifold formula_16, if a chart formula_148 is given with formula_149, then one can define an ordered basis formula_150 of formula_151 by
Then for every tangent vector formula_153, one has
This formula therefore expresses formula_128 as a linear combination of the basis tangent vectors formula_156 defined by the coordinate chart formula_20.
The derivative of a map.
Every smooth (or differentiable) map formula_158 between smooth (or differentiable) manifolds induces natural linear maps between their corresponding tangent spaces:
If the tangent space is defined via differentiable curves, then this map is defined by
If, instead, the tangent space is defined via derivations, then this map is defined by
The linear map formula_51 is called variously the "derivative", "total derivative", "differential", or "pushforward" of formula_163 at formula_1. It is frequently expressed using a variety of other notations:
In a sense, the derivative is the best linear approximation to formula_163 near formula_1. Note that when formula_168, then the map formula_169 coincides with the usual notion of the differential of the function formula_163. In local coordinates the derivative of formula_163 is given by the Jacobian.
An important result regarding the derivative map is the following:
This is a generalization of the inverse function theorem to maps between manifolds.
