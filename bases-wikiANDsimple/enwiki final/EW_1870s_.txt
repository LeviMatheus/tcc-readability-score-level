The 1870s (pronounced "eighteen-seventies") was a [[decade]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]] that began on January 1, 1870, and ended on December 31, 1879.
The trends of the [[1860s|previous decade]] continued into this one, as new [[empire]]s, [[imperialism]] and [[militarism]] rose in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. The [[United States]] was recovering from the [[American Civil War]], though the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] introduced its own legacies of bitterness and [[racial segregation]] in the country. [[Germany]] [[unification of Germany|unified]] as a nation in 1871 and began its [[Second Reich]]. Changing social conditions led workforces to cooperate in the form of [[labor union]]s in order to demand better pay and working conditions, with [[strike action|strike]]s occurring worldwide in the later part of the decade and continuing until [[World War I]]. The decade was also a period of significant technological advancement; the [[phonograph]], [[telephone]], and electric [[light bulb]] were all invented during the 1870s, though it would take several more decades before they became household items.
