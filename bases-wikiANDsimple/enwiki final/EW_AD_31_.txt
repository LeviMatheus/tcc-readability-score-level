AD 31 (XXXI) was a common year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Tiberius and Sejanus (or, less frequently, year 784 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 31 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
