Year 104 (CIV) was a leap year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 104th Year of the Anno Domini (AD) designation, the 104th year of the 1st millennium, the 4th year of the 2nd century, and the 5th year of the 100s decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Suburanus and Marcellus (or, less frequently, year 857 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 104 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
