AD 95 (XCV) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 95th Year of the Anno Domini (AD) designation, the 95th year of the 1st millennium, the 95th year of the end of the 1st century, and the 5th year of the 10th decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Augustus and Clemens (or, less frequently, year 848 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 95 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
