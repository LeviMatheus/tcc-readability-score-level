, also known as , was a Japanese statesman, courtier and politician of the early Heian period.
He was born the third son of Fujiwara no Nagara, but was adopted by his powerful uncle Fujiwara no Yoshifusa, who had no sons. Mototsune followed in Yoshifusa's footsteps, holding power in the court in the position of regent for four successive emperors.
Mototsune invented the position of "kampaku" regent for himself in order to remain in power even after an emperor reached maturity. This innovation allowed the Fujiwara clan to tighten its grip on power right throughout an emperor's reign.
Mototsune is referred to as "Shōsen Kō" (昭宣公) (posthumous name as Daijō Daijin).
