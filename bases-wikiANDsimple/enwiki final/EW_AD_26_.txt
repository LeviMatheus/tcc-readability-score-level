AD 26 (XXVI) was a common year starting on Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 26th Year of the Anno Domini (AD) designation, the 26th year of the 1st millennium, the 26th year of the 1st century, and the 6th year of the 3rd decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lentulus and Sabinus (or, less frequently, year 779 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 26 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
