Christine Lavin (born January 2, 1952) is a New York City-based singer-songwriter and promoter of contemporary folk music. She has recorded numerous solo albums, and has also recorded with other female folk artists under the name Four Bitchin' Babes. She is known for her sense of humor, which is expressed in both her music and her onstage performances. Many of her songs alternate between comedy and emotional reflections on romance.
Lavin worked at Caffe Lena in Saratoga, New York until Dave Van Ronk convinced her to move to New York City and make a career as a singer-songwriter. She followed his advice and accepted his offer of guitar lessons. She was the original host of "Sunday Breakfast" on WFUV in New York City and a founding member of the Four Bitchin' Babes when they were formed in 1990.
She is a lifelong astrophysics hobbyist and has included those themes in her music. She is the favorite musician of Neil deGrasse Tyson.
