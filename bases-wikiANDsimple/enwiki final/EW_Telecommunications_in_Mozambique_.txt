Telecommunications in Mozambique include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.
Internet.
Mozambique has a comparatively low Internet penetration rate with only 4.8% of the population having access to the Internet compared to 16% for Africa as a whole.
Telecommunication de Mozambique (TDM), Mozambique's national fixed-line operator, offers ADSL Internet access for home and business customers. In early 2014 packages ranged from 512 kbit/s with a 6 GByte cap for MTN750 (~US$21) to 4 Mbit/s with a 43 GByte cap for MTN4300 (~US$118).
The three mobile operators, Movitel, mCel and Vodacom, also offer 3G Internet access.
Mozambique was the first African country to offer broadband wireless services using WiMax.
With the introduction of the SEACOM submarine cable in July 2009 and the EASSY submarine cable in July 2010, Mozambique now has access to less expensive international connectivity and is no longer reliant on VSAT or neighbor South Africa for Internet transit services.
Internet censorship and surveillance.
There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet, however, opposition party members report government intelligence agents monitor e-mail.
The constitution and law provide for freedom of speech and the press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Individuals can generally criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal. Some individuals express a fear that the government monitors their private telephone and e-mail communications. Many journalists practice self-censorship.
