 Bi-curious is a term for a person, usually someone who is a heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly-heterosexual or mostly-homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms "heteroflexible" and "homoflexible" are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the "wish to experiment with sexuality" implied by the bi-curious label. 
Etymology.
The term started becoming popular after 1984, according to Merriam-Webster, but "The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English" and "Oxford Dictionariesâ€™ Lexico" claim that the term was coined in 1990.
