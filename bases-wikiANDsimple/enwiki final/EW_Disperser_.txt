A disperser is a one-sided extractor. Where an extractor requires that every event gets the same probability under the uniform distribution and the extracted distribution, only the latter is required for a disperser. So for a disperser, an event formula_1 we have:
formula_2
Definition (Disperser): "A" formula_3"-disperser is a function"
formula_4
"such that for every distribution" formula_5 "on" formula_6 "with" formula_7 "the support of the distribution" formula_8 "is of size at least" formula_9.
Graph theory.
An ("N", "M", "D", "K", "e")-disperser is a bipartite graph with "N" vertices on the left side, each with degree "D", and "M" vertices on the right side, such that every subset of "K" vertices on the left side is connected to more than (1 − "e")"M" vertices on the right.
An extractor is a related type of graph that guarantees an even stronger property; every ("N", "M", "D", "K", "e")-extractor is also an ("N", "M", "D", "K", "e")-disperser.
Other meanings.
A disperser is a high-speed mixing device used to disperse or dissolve pigments and other solids into a liquid.
