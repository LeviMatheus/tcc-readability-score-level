AD 56 (LVI) was a leap year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known in the Roman Empire as the Year of the Consulship of Saturninus and Scipio (or, less frequently, year 809 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 56 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
