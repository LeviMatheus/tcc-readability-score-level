Year 102 (CII) was a common year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ursus and Sura (or, less frequently, year 855 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 102 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
