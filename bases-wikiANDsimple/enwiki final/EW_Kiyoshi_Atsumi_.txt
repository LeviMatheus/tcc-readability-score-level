Kiyoshi Atsumi (渥美 清 "Atsumi Kiyoshi"), born Yasuo Tadokoro (田所 康雄 "Tadokoro Yasuo", 10 March 1928 – 4 August 1996), was a Japanese actor. He was born in Tokyo, and started his career in 1951 as a comedian at a strip-show theater in Asakusa. After two years of fighting pulmonary tuberculosis, he made his debut on TV in 1956 and on film in 1957. His vivid performance of a lovable, innocent man in the film “Dear Mr. Emperor” ("Haikei Tenno-Heika-Sama") in 1963 established his reputation as an actor.
Later he became the star of the highly popular "Tora-san series of films". His portrayal of the main characters lasted from the original "Otoko wa Tsurai yo" (translated in English as 'It's Tough being a Man') in 1969 to the 48th film released in 1995, the year before his death. The enduring success of the series made him synonymous with the Tora-san character, and when he died in Tokyo, many Japanese regarded his death as the death of the character Tora-san, not the death of the actor Yasuo Tadokoro or Kiyoshi Atsumi.
