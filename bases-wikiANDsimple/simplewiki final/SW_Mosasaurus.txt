Mosasaurus was a giant, meat-eating marine reptiles (a mosasaur, not a dinosaur) that lived during the late Cretaceous period. It was up to 40-59 ft (12.5-17.6 m) long. Mosasaurus had four paddle-like limbs on a long, streamlined body and a long, powerful tail. The large head had huge jaws (up to 4.7 ft =1.45 m long) with many teeth. The jaws could open about 3 feet (1 m). The lower jaw is loosely hinged to the skull with a moveable joint on each side (behind the teeth). This loose joint let it swallow huge prey, like some snakes. They hunted fish, turtles, mollusks, and shellfish. Mosasaurus lived in the North Atlantic Ocean. "Mosasaurus maximus" found in Onion Creek, Texas, USA. It was 30 foot (9 m) long and its tail was about 12 ft (3.7 m) long. This huge reptile was discovered in 1934 by University of Texas geology students Clyde Ikins. The first Mosasaur, "Mosasaurus hoffmani", was found in the Netherlands in 1780. It was named in 1822 by W.D. Conybeare. Mosasaurus are related to modern-day monitor lizards.
