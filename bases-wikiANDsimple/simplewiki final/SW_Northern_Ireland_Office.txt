The Northern Ireland Office was set up in 1971. It is a ministry in the British Government which looks after the affairs of Northern Ireland.
It head of the Office is called the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.
The job of Secretary of State is less important now because the Northern Ireland Assembly and the ministers in the assembly do a lot of the work of the Northern Ireland Office.
