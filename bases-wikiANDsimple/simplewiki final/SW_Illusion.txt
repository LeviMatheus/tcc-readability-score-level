An illusion is a distortion of how things seem to be. It shows how the brain normally arranges, sorts, and explains stimulation of the senses. Illusions can change the way reality seems to be. In general, they are shared by most people. Illusions can happen with all five senses (taste, touch, sight, smell, and hearing). Some illusions happen because of disorders.
An illusion is different from a hallucination; a halucination is sensing something which is not real, but an illusion is interpreting what we sense wrongly.
Optical illusions.
They are the most known and understood. The brain doesn’t understand information the eye takes in. The brain makes wrong guesses about what the eye sees.
Auditory illusions.
They are illusions that are heard. The person listening hears sounds that aren’t really there, or sounds that can’t really happen. A Shepard tone is an auditory illusion.
Touch illusion.
They are when a person feels something that isn’t there, or something that shouldn’t be there but feels like it is. This happens sometimes when a person loses his arm. The person still feels like the arm is there. They might want to scratch the arm, or the arm might hurt them. This can happen with any limb of the body, and it is called the phantom limb.
