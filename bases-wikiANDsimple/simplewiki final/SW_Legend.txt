Legends are usually very old stories with little or no evidence to prove them. Legends are often passed on by word-of-mouth. They are very similar to myths.
Legends can also be famous or historically significant people, places, art, etc..
Examples of legends include: King Arthur, the Fountain of Youth, or Loch Ness.
We sometimes say of someone who is extremely famous that they are a "legend" or "of legendary fame".
