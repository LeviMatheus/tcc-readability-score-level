Rhodesian Ridgeback is a breed of dog.
It has red-brown hair on its body and a line of hair down its back which is different from the rest of hair on its body. They are sometimes called "The African Lion Dog", becuase they were used by hunters in Africa to sniff out and confuse lions while the hunter shot the lion.
