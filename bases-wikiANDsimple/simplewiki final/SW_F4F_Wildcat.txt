The F4F Wilcat was a fighter aircraft made by Grumman. It first flew in 1937, and was introduced in 1940. It was used in the Pacific during the early years of World War II. It could take off aircraft carriers. During the war, it mainly fought the A6M Zero. Because the Wildcat was not able to beat the Zero, a new airplane was made called the F6F Hellcat. The Wildcat was retired in 1945.
