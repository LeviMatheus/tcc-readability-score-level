Modular Audio Recognition Framework (MARF) is a computer program that tries to understand voice, sound, speech, text and human language in general. In MARF, scientists and programmers write algorithms using Java. MARF consists of Lego-like algorithm pieces that can be added or replaced easily. MARF itself can be piece in other computer programs or used for learning, education, and making MARF itself better. A few example programs are provided to show how to use MARF. There is also a lot of documentation of the project. MARF and its programs are published under a BSD-style license.
