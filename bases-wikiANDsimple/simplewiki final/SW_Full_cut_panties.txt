Full cut panties are underwear for women. They are known for having a high waistline and are usually thought to be worn by older or more conservative women. The informal nickname for this kind of underwear is granny panties, which is short for "grandmother panties". Some full cut panties have lace, satin or other "feminine" fabrics. However, most full cut panties are made of cotton or other comfortable materials.
