History.
In 1945, two local CSU groups were founded. One in Würzburg and the other in Munich.
In January 1946 the CSU was founded for the whole of Bavaria.
All state elections of Bavaria were won by the CSU. Sometimes the CSU had to make some coalitions with the Bayernpartei (Bavarian Party), the FDP or the SPD.
In the federal government the CSU always joins with the CDU.
One very famous leader of the CSU was Franz Josef Strauß. Sometimes he was well known for the good that he did. Other times because of scandals.

The CSU is a very conservative party according to the people of Bavaria, who mainly live in the countryside and smaller towns and villages.
