Black metal is a style of metal music that started in the early 1980s. It is known by its aggressive and cold sound, and black metal records usually do not have good production. This is because black metal musicians usually want to keep the sound as natural as possible, unlike many death metal bands. Lyrics are usually against religion, especially against Christianity. Most of the black metal bands have relations to satanism in their lyrics and even in outlook.
Black metal is often divided into two waves. The first wave began in the early 1980s by bands such as Venom, Bathory, Hellhammer, Celtic Frost and Mercyful Fate. Venom's first albums, Welcome to Hell and Black Metal are usually said to be the first black metal records. Second wave is the most popular wave of black metal and it started in the early 1990s. It started from Norway and includes bands such as Darkthrone, Enslaved, Burzum, Satyricon, Mayhem, Gorgoroth, Immortal, and Emperor.
Black metal is also very controversial, especially in Norway. During the early 1990s, certain black metal musicians burned old churches in Norway as a statement towards their anti-Christian beliefs. One of the people who was found guilty for burning churches, Varg Vikernes, was also found guilty for murdering Ã˜ystein Aarseth, a fellow black metal musician. Of recently, Gaahl, the leader singer of Gorgoroth, has served two prison sentences for acts of violence in 2001 and 2006.

National Socialist black metal (also known as Nazi black metal or NSBM) is a title used to refer to black metal acts with an emphasis on National Socialist beliefs in their music. For example Absurd and Nokturnal Mortum are National Socialist black metal bands.
