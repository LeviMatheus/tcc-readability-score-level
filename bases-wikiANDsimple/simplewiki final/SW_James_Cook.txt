During his lifetime, he sailed twice around the world. He crossed the Antarctic Circle and found new islands and landscapes in North America and the South Pacific. During his trips, he spent a lot of time on science experiments, and mapping new areas. He also wrote a lot of books about what he found.
Cook's Life.
Cook was born on October 27, 1728 in Marton (York). He was a son of a Scottish farmer. Ever since he was young, he had dreamed of being captain on a ship and sailing around the world. After 18 years, Cook felt that he had to live his dreams. He knew that he must have another destiny other than farming for the rest of his life. His career started as a seaman in the Royal Navy. Cook was not just a normal seaman. He studied as much as he could. That is how he learned a lot of good knowledge about navigation and science. He was sent on three expeditions with the ship called "Endeavour" all over the world.
At the beginning, it was an honor to be on these expeditions. After a while, money was the most important reason for doing his job. After his death, his wife inherited 70,000 gold coins.
