Domestication is a change that happens in wild animals or plants, when they are kept by humans for a long time.
If humans take wild animals and plants and keep and breed them, over time the animals and plants may change. The animals and plants become dependent on the humans who keep them, and they change in ways that are better for human use. This change (domestication) happens in the group of domesticated animals or plants as a whole. It is not the same as taming one individual animal.
The first domestication of plants happened during the first use of agriculture. Human first domesticated dogs. After the invention of agriculture, people domesticated sheep and goats, and later cattle and pigs.
Domesticated plants are crops or ornamental plants. People use domesticated animals as livestock, that means for food, clothing, and work. Otherwise, the domesticated animals may be kept as pets.
