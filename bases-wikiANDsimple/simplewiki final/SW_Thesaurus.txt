A thesaurus is a book of synonyms (words that mean the same thing). Thesauruses (Thesauri) often include related words that mean almost the same thing. Some thesauruses also include antonyms (words that have the opposite meaning).
For example, by looking up the word "big" in a thesaurus, someone would find a list of other similar words such as "huge" and "massive". If the thesarus also has a list of antonyms, the person could also find words which mean the opposite, like "small" and "tiny".
Many students and writers use a thesaurus to help them find words when they are writing. Using a thesaurus can help a person to improve their vocabulary (the number of words that they know).
