A knife is a metal tool with a sharpened metal blade that is used to cut all sorts of things. The plural form of "knife" is "knives".
Picking the right type of knife.
There are many kinds of knives depending what to be cut. With the right knife, cutting can be done efficiently (well). With the wrong kind of knife, cutting will be less efficient. When a knife is too small to cut something, a saw, axe, or power tool may be needed.
Illegal types of knives.
Carrying knives is illegal in many countries, especially if the blade is longer than several inches. Another type of knife which is illegal in many places is the "switchblade", a knife that has a button which when pressed activates a spring to open the knife.
