A weasel is a meat-eating mammal. It is a part of the genus "Mustela". At one time only one of the sixteen species of "Mustela" was called "weasel". This was the European Least Weasel ("Mustela nivalis"). Today, the term weasel is often used for all species of the group. Ten of the sixteen species have the word "weasel" in their common name. Those that are not called weasel include the stoat, the two species of mink, and the polecats or ferrets
