George Washington (February 22, 1732 â€“ December 14, 1799) was the first President of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He was also the commander of all American forces during the American Revolutionary War.
Early years.
His mother was Mary Ball and his father was Augustine Washington. They were teachers at the local university. They lived in Virginia. As a child, Washington did not attend school for very long.
Before the Revolutionary War.
Washington was a farmer like his father. His large farm, or plantation, was called Mount Vernon.
Washington began his army career during the French and Indian War. He first was a messenger for Virginia. He later led troops against the French. The British did not think soldiers from the colonies were as good as they were, so Washington went home and started to farm again.
In 1759, Washington married Martha Custis Washington. They did not have any children.
The Revolution.
Washington wanted the Thirteen Colonies to be independent. Washington was chosen by the Second Continental Congress to be the commanding general of the Continental Army. Washington led the army until the end of the war in 1783. He is noted for leading troops across the Delaware River on Christmas Day, 1777, in a surprise attack on German mercenaries at Trenton, New Jersey. The British had many more troops and more supplies than Washington. However, Washington kept his troops together. He did not win many battles, but he never let the British destroy his army. With the help of the French navy, Washington made the British surrender at Yorktown, Virginia in 1781. The war officially ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1783.
After the war.
When the Revolutionary war ended, Washington went home to Mount Vernon. He wanted the colonies to have a strong government. Washington was voted president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787. Washington wanted the states to ratify the Constitution of the United States and they did.
