Impala ("Aepyceros melampus") is is a medium-sized African antelope. The name impala comes from the Zulu language.
Description.
The impala is reddish-brown with white hair inside the ears, over each eye and on the chin, upper throat, underparts and buttocks. A narrow black line runs along the middle of the lower back to the tail, and a vertical black stripe appears on the back of each thigh. Impalas have unique brushlike tufts of black hair that cover a scent gland located just above the heel on each hind leg.
Habitat.
Impalas are found at grassland and woodland edges, usually very close by water.
