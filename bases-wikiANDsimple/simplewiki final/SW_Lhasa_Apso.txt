The Lhasa Apso is a small breed of dog. It originated in Lhasa, Tibet, which it is named after. Male Lhasas generally weigh about 14 to 18 pounds, and female Lhasas weigh 12 to 14 pounds. Lhasas have developed a thick coat due to the fact that they were bred in Tibet, which can get very cold. Their fur comes in many different colors, and they usually have dark brown eyes and a black nose. Lhasas generally live long lives, some surviving into their twenties. Lhasa Apsos do tend to develop some sort of arthritis in their legs, which is due to the fact they are excitable, energetic dogs. As they grow older they may weaken in their legs.
