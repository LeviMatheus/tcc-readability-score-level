Wave-particle duality is where waves can behave like particles, and particles can behave like waves. Albert Einstein and Louis de Broglie were scientists who studied it.
Particles as waves.
An electron has a wavelength called the "de Broglie wavelength". It can be calculated using the equation
formula_1
formula_2 is the de Broglie wavelength.
formula_3 is Planck's constant
formula_4 is the momentum of the particle.
This made the idea that electrons in atoms show a standing wave pattern.
Waves as particles.
The photoelectric effect shows that a light photon which has enough energy (a high enough frequency), can cause an electron to be released off a metals surface. Electrons in this case can be called photoelectrons.
