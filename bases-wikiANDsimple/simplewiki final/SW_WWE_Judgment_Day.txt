Judgment Day is a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view aired by World Wrestling Entertainment. The first Judgment Day was in October 1998 as an In Your House event. This pay-per-view replaced Over the Edge after the 1999 event, which saw the death of Owen Hart. In 2000, Judgment Day became the yearly May event which followed Backlash. From 2004 to 2006, Judgment Day was only for the SmackDown! brand.
