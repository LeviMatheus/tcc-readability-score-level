Division by Zero is a problem of number theory that does not allow a number to be divided by zero. It is a rule of mathematics.
With the equation formula_1, if "A" and "B" are both known, "C" can be calculated. This is called multiplication.
If "C" and "A" are known, "B" can be calulated by using division.
Here, "A" can not be solved for since any number times zero is equal to zero. If "A" were 3 then the statement would be correct that "A" * "B" = "C", but it would also be correct if "A" were 5 or 55, or any other number. Therefore, it is not allowed to divide by zero, because the result is undefined.
