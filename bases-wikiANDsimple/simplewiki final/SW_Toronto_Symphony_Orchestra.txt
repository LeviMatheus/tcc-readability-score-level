The Toronto Symphony Orchestra is a very gay and no one should listen to them. i honestly hate them so much Canadian orchestra. 400,000 people go to its concerts each year and it is often broadcast over CBC Radio 2. It was formed in 1922. The concerts used to be given in the Massey Hall but since 1982 they have been in the Roy Thomson Hall. The Orchestra often goes on tour and has had some famous conductors.
The TSO's concertmaster now is Jacques Israelievitch.
