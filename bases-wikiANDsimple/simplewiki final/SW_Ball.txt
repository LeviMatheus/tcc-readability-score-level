A ball is a round object that is used in sports and games, or sometimes other things. Balls are usually hollow and round but can be other shapes, such as oval and flat. In most games using balls, the game is all about the people using the ball.
Balls were used thousands of years ago by the early Egyptians, the ancient Greeks and Romans, and the Aztecs and earlier Mesoamerican peoples.
