Copyright infringement (or copyright violation) is the use of material which is covered by copyright law, in a way that violates one of the original copyright owner's exclusive rights, such as the right to reproduce or perform the copyrighted work, or to make derivative works that build upon it. The slang term "bootleg" (from the use of boots to smuggle items) is often used to describe illegally copied material.
For media such as movies and music, unauthorized copying and distribution is occasionally called piracy or theft. Some people do not think the word "piracy" should be used to describe copyright infringement. They say that it unfairly equates copyright infringement with a more sinister or "evil" activity, which still exists. However, some courts say that under law, either word may be used.
