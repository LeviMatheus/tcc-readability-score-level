Monolophosaurus was a medium-sized meat-eater from China that lived during the Jurassic Period. It had lots of sharp teeth and a big, skinny head. It also had one feature not found on any other meat-eat. The area where Monolophosaurus was discovered showed signs that it was sometimes covered with water, so it is possible that this dinosaur lived on the shore of a lake or sea.ting dinosaur - a long, bony ridge that went from its nose back to the top of its head.
The remains of the type of Monolophosaurus preserve a complete skull and partial postcranium (Zhao & Currie, 1994). In fact, these remains are amongst the most complete from the Middle Jurassic of China (Rauhut, 2003). A recent phylogenetic analysis (Rauhut, 2003) places Monolophosaurus as the basalmost member of the the Allosauroidea.
