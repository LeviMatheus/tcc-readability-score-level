Mongolia is a country between China and Russia, in Asia. Until recently, most of the people there were Buddhists, and many of them are nomads (people who always move and stay in one home), but this is changing. The largest city, and capital city is Ulaanbaatar, which has been spelled "Ulan Bator" and other ways in the past. The north and east parts of the country have many mountains, and part of the south part is the Gobi Desert. There are 2,791,272 people living in Mongolia, which is the 18th biggest country in the World, with an area of 1,564,116 square kilometres.
