Nicholas II of Russia, (May 18, 1868 â€“ July 17, 1918) was the last Tsar or Emperor of Russia. He became Tsar in 1894 after his father, Tsar Alexander III died, but was forced to quit in 1917, during the Russian Revolution. He married Princess Alix of Hesse, who was the granddaughter of Queen Victoria, and they had five children, Olga, Tatiana, Maria,Anastasia, and Alexi. There were many problems during his time as Tsar, and many people in the country did not like him. His son, Alexi suffered from a disease called haemophilia, which was a problem as well. In 1917, he abdicated (gave up being Tsar) and he and his family were held under house arrest. On July 17, 1918, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were all killed by a firing squad. In 1981, the executed royal family were made Saints by the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1990, the bones of the Tsar and his family were found in the woods and given a proper burial in 1998.
