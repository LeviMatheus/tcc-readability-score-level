The act of killing a living thing can be said to have happened when an outside force, usually another life form, has done something to cause it to die.
When a human being is killed by the action or fault of another human being, this event is called a homicide. When a human being is killed by the action of himself (or herself), it is called a suicide.
A kill is also the act of shooting down a fighter aircraft. There are laws against this.
