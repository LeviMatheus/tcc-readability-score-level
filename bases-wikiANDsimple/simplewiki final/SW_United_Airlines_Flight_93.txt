United Airlines Flight 93 was a scheduled U.S. domestic passenger flight from Newark International Airport, in Newark, New Jersey, to San Francisco International Airport. It was hijacked by four men as part of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Minutes into the flight, the hijackers breached the cockpit and overpowered the pilots. They assumed control of the aircraft and diverted it toward Washington, D.C. Several passengers and crew members made calls aboard the flight and learned about the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. The passengers then decided to mount an assault on the hijackers and wrest control of the aircraft.
The plane crashed in a field just outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, about northwest of Washington, D.C. The subsequent investigation determined that the actions of those on board had prevented the hijackers from reaching their intended target.
