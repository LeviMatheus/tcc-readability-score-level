Pedro Calderón de la Barca y Henao (January 17, 1600 – May 25, 1681), was a dramatist of the Spanish Golden Age.
Calderón was born in Madrid. His mother, who was of Flemish descent, died in 1610; his father, who was secretary to the treasury, died in 1615. Calderón was educated at the Jesuit College in Madrid, the Colegio Imperial, with a view to taking orders; but instead, he studied law at Salamanca.
