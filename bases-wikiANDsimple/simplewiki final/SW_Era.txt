An era is a very long time, probably millions of years. Scientists talk about eras like the Mesozoic era, when dinosaurs lived on the Earth.
Earth's existence is separated by geologists into even longer times called eons. A number of eras make up an eon.
We are now in the Cenozoic Era of the Phanerozoic Eon. Cenozoic is from a Greek word meaning "new life", that is, the time of the newest life on Earth.
The Phanerozoic Eon started about 545 million years ago. It is made up of the Paleozoic (from the Greek for "oldest life") Era, the Mesozoic ("middle life") Era and the Cenozoic Era.
The Paleozoic Era started about 545 million years ago, then the Cenozoic Era started about 248 million years ago. This was followed by our era, the Cenozoic Era, which started about 65 million years ago.
