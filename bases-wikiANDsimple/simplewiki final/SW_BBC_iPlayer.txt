BBC iPlayer is a service developed by the BBC which lets you catch up on the last week's television and radio. BBC iPlayer was first called the Integrated Media Player (iMP), the Interactive Media Player, and then MyBBCPlayer. iPlayer is available online on the BBC website, through P2P, cable television, iPhone and iPod Touch. BBC iPlayer left Beta and went live on December 25 2007.
On June 25 2008, it was announced that a new-look iPlayer would be launched. The new version is now live.
