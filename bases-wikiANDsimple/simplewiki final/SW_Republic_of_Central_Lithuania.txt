The Republic of Central Lithuania or Middle Lithuania (,), or simply Central Lithuania (,), was a short-lived political entity which did not gain international recognition. It was created in 1920 following the staged rebellion of soldiers of the 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division of the Polish Army, supported by the Polish air force, cavalry and artillery. Centered around the historical capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Vilna (,), for eighteen months the entity served as a buffer state between Poland, upon which it depended, and Lithuania, which claimed the area. After a variety of delays, a disputed election took place on January 8 1922, and the territory was annexed to Poland.
The Polish-Lithuanian borders in the interwar period, while recognized by the Conference of Ambassadors of the Entente and the League of Nations, were not recognized by the Republic of Lithuania. In 1931 an international court in the Hague issued the determination that the Polish seizure and ongoing control of the city was a violation of international law.
