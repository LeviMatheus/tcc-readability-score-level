The Crimean War (1853â€“1866), also called the Eastern War (), was a war fought between Russia and France, the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Sardinia and the Ottoman Empire on the other side. Most of the fighting happened in the Crimean Peninsula, with other fighting in western Turkey, and around the Baltic Sea.
The Crimean War is sometimes called the fist "modern" war, since the weaponry and tactics used had never been seen before and affected all other wars after it.
Differences.
The Crimean War was a very important point in the history of warfare. It was not only different in the weapons it used, it was also the first war related to by press, by photography and journalists. Another very important factor was that it was the first war with real field hospitals, started by Florence Nightingale. A defeat by Russia in the war caused increased development of weaponry and the emancipation (breaking down serfdom) in 1861.
