Muskox ("Ovibos moschatus") are large, long-haired, horned mammals that are well-adapted to their cold, Arctic environment. They are found in the far north of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Norway, Siberia, and some Arctic islands.
Diet.
Musk oxen are herbivores (plant-eaters) that graze on grasses, willow leaves, and some Arctic flowers. They are ruminants; they swallow their food without chewing it. Later, they regurgitate the food (called a cud) and chew it. Musk Oxen, like other ruminants, have a four-part stomach.
Behavior.
Musk oxen travel in herds. The herd protects the young from predators, like wolves. When in danger, a herd will close ranks, with the musk oxen on the perimeter of the group facing outwards.
