The All India Muslim League was a political party of British India. It was created at Dacca in 1906 and helped to create Pakistan as a Muslim state in the Indian subcontinent. After the independence of India and Pakistan, the League continued as a small party in India, especially in Kerala, where it is often in government within a coalition with others.
In Pakistan, the League formed the country's first government, but lost power and split during the 1950s following an army coup.
