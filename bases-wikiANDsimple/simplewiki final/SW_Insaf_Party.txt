The Insaf Party (Justice Party), was a Muslim political party. It was founded by Syed Shahabuddin in 1989 as a split from the Janata Party - it formed as a protest against the alliance between V.P. Singh and the right wing Bharatiya Janata Party. When the V.P. Singh government fell in 1990, the IP stopped being a party.
