Louis the Stammerer (November 1, 846 — April 10, 879;), was the oldest son of Charles the Bald and Ermentrude of Orléans. He became King of France after his father in France in 877. Unlike his father, he never became Holy Roman Emperor.
Louis the Stammerer married twice. With his first wife Ansgarde of Burgundy he had two sons: Louis III of France (born in 863) and Carloman, King of the West Franks (born in 866). Both of them became kings of France. They also had two daughters: Hildegarde (born in 864) and Gisela (865–884). With his second wife, Adelaide of Paris, he had one daughter, Ermentrude (875–914) — who was the mother of Cunigunde, wife of the Count Palatine Wigerich of Bidgau; they were the ancestors of the House of Luxemburg —, and a posthumous son, Charles the Simple, who also became a king of France.
