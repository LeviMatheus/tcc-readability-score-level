Plate tectonics) is a theory of geology. It has been developed to explain for large scale motions of the Earth's lithosphere. This theory replaces the older theory of continental drift from the first half of the 20th century and the concept of seafloor spreading that was developed during the 1960s.
Following this theory the outermost part of the Earth's interior is made up of two layers: above is the lithosphere, which includes the crust and the rigid uppermost part of the mantle.
Below the lithosphere lies the asthenosphere. Although solid, the asthenosphere has relatively low viscosity and shear strength and can flow like a liquid on geological time scales. The deeper mantle below the asthenosphere is more rigid again. This is, however, due not to cooler temperatures but to high pressure.
The lithosphere is broken up into what are called "tectonic plates"â€”in the case of Earth, there are seven major and many minor plates (see list below). The lithospheric plates ride on the asthenosphere. These plates move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent or collision boundaries, divergent or spreading boundaries, and transform boundaries. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation occur along plate boundaries. The lateral movement of the plates is typically at speeds of 0.66 to 8.50 centimeters per year.
