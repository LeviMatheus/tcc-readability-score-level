"Death Note" is a popular manga and anime series from Japan. It is about a teenage boy named Light Yagami, who finds a magical notebook. The notebook is called a "Death Note". When Light writes the name of a person in the book, that person dies. If he wants to, Light can say how he wants the person to die. If he does not say how, then the person dies from a heart attack. Light uses the Death Note to kill criminals. Some people are happy with this, others are not. This results in a all out brawl between both sides in the series.
