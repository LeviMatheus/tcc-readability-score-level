Object-oriented programming or OOP is a paradigm of computer science. A computer program is made of a collection of objects that each have aids, that call each other. In the traditional view, a program used to call functions that act on some set of data. With the object-oriented view, the set of data that is acted upon is implicit (the object itself).
Each object can receive messages, process data, and send messages to other objects. Each object can be seen as an independent little machine or actor with a distinct role or responsibility.
People say object-oriented programming gives them more flexibility. Since it promotes the use of clean specifications and programming interfaces, it can lead to programs that are easier to maintain. It is very popular in software engineering. Some people also say that those new to programming will learn the object-oriented approach more easily. Other people question this, and say that at least for some fields of programming, object-oriented programming adds more problems than it solves.
