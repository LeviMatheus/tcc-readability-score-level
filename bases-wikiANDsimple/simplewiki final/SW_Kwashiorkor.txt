Kwashiorkor is a type of protein energy malnutrition. If a child uses up energy from carbohydrates and lipids, their body may begin to use protein for energy.
The body breaks down protein into energy that can be used. They then do not have enough protein for other functions in their bodies. Children from aged 1-4 years usually get this but rarely adults and older children get it. It is common in places like Africa. Symptoms include having a pot belly, swollen face, and hair that is dark then light then dark. This can be cured by having a protein rich diet.
