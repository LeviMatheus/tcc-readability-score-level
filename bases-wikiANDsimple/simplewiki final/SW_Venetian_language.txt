The Venetian language (in Venetian: "v√®neto") is a Romance language.
It was the language once spoken in the Republic of Venice.
In the present day, it is spoken in the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, in Slovenia and in Croatia. It is also spoken in Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina states) and Mexico (town of Chipilo) by the descendants of Italian immigrants.
