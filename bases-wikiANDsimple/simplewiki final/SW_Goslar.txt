History.
The German Emperor Henry I founded Goslar in 922. In the 11th century Goslar became seat of a Pfalz, a temporary seat of the Emperor. In 1253 Goslar became a Free City (that means without being ruled a Duke) in the Holy Roman Empire and joined the Hanseatic League.
Henry 4th a Holy Roman Emperor came from Goslar.
In the Thirty-year War Goslar belonged to the loyalists of the Emperor, although its territory belonged to a Protestant region. The Swedish King Gustav II Adolph punished Goslar for supporting the imperial forces. After 1642 Goslar came under the rule of the Welfs.
In 1803 Goslar lost its status as a Free City and belonged to Prussia. Napoleon made Goslar a part of the Kingdom of Westphalia. After the Napoleonic Wars it became part of the Kingdom of Hanover.
In the 19th century Goslar lost its economic base. Now it lives mainly on tourism.
