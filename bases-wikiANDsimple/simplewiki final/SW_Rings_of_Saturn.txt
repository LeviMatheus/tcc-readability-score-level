The rings of Saturn is the name of the rings around the planet
Saturn. They consist of countless small particles, ranging in size from microscopic to the size of a bus (or bigger) that form clumps that in turn move around Saturn. The particles in the rings are made almost entirely of water ice, with just a small amount of dust and other chemicals.
