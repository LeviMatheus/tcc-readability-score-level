Mutual assured destruction (MAD) is a military strategy. It should help to avoid a nuclear war. If a state attacks another with nuclear weapons, the state attacked will likely be able to attack back. The attacker must think that he will be destroyed with his victim if he attacks. The theory is that no state would start an attack if attacking its enemy means its own destruction.
