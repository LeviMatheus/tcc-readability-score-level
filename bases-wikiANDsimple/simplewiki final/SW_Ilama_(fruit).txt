Ilama is a kind of fruit, and also the name of the tree that it grows on. The trees and fruits can be found in tropical Central America. The name comes from the Spanish tranlsation of the Nahuatl "ilamatzapotl". Its rough translation is 'old woman's sapote'. The name is also applied to a similar fruit, soncoya or "cabeza de negro" ("A. pupurea") which is cultivated as an alternative to the cherimoya. The soncoya is similar in size to the Ilama but grey brown in color with hard bumps on the surface, and orange flesh that tastes like mango or papaw.
The Ilama fruit is delicious when eaten ripe. It is either eaten on the half-shell or scooped out with a tool. The Ilama is usually chilled when served, it is sometimes served with a little cream and sugar to intensify the flavor, or with a drop of lime or lemon juice to bring in a tart and bitter tinge.
