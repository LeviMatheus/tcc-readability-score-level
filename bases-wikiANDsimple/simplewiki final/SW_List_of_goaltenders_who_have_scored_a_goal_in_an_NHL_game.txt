There have been nine goaltenders who have scored a goal in a National Hockey League (NHL) game. The most recent to do so was Chris Mason in 2006, who was credited with a goal after he was the last player to touch the puck before his opponents put the puck into their own net. The most recent goaltender to have scored a goal by actually shooting the puck into his opponents' net was Evgeni Nabokov, in 2002.
