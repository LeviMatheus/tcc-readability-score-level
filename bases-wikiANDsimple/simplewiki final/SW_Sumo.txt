Sumo (or sumo wrestling) is a sport from Japan where heavy men try to push one another out of a ring or onto the ground. Most of the time, the bigger sumo wrestler wins. To get heavier, sumo wrestlers eat a special food that helps them gain weight.
Sumo wrestlers need to be fat because the fatter they are, the harder it is to defeat them. The sumo wrestler who weighs the most, named Konishiki, weighs about 264 kg (580 lb).
In May 2008, a European, Kotooshu from Bulgaria, won a championship for the first time ever.
The main tournaments take place in Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuoka.
In 2008 both top wrestlers, Asashoryu and Hakuho, are Mongolian. Hakuho won the Nagoya tournament in July with no losses, 15-0.
