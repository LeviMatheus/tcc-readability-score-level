Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia was a daughter of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. She was born on June 26, 1899. One of her sisters was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. Her other sisters were Olga and Tatiana. Her brother was Alexei. Her friends said that she was a pretty girl who liked to flirt with boys.
The family was killed by Bolsheviks on July 17, 1918 during the Russian Revolution. Some people think Maria or her sister Anastasia was saved by a soldier who liked the girls. Two bodies were missing from the family's grave when it was found in 1991. The missing bodies are Alexei and Maria or her sister Anastasia.
A man named Gabriel Louis Duval thinks his foster grandmother, Granny Alena, might have been Grand Duchess Maria. He wrote a book called "A Princess in the Family."
Grand Duchess Maria is a saint in the Russian Orthodox Church. She was made a saint in 2000. Her parents and sisters and brother were also made saints.
