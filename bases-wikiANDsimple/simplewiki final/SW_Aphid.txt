Aphids are small insects that feed on plants. Aphids cause more plant damage than any other insects. There are about 4,000 different types of aphids known.
Presently aphids are classified in 10 families, though historically there were many fewer, with most species included in the family Aphididae. Around 250 species are serious pests for agriculture and forestry as well as an annoyance for gardeners. They vary in size from 1-10Â mm long.
Important natural enemies include the predatory lady beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), hoverfly larvae (Diptera: Syrphidae), and lacewings (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae), and entomopathogenic fungi like "Lecanicillium lecanii" and the Entomophthorales.
Aphids are found many places on earth. Aphids are most common in temperate zones.
Aphids can travel far in the air. For example, the lettuce aphid spread from New Zealand to Tasmania. They have also been spread by human transportation of infested plant materials.
