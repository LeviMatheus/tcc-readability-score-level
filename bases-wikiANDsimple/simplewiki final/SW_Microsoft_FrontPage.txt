Microsoft FrontPage is a program made by Microsoft to help people make webpages and full websites. It was one of Microsoft Office programs until 2003.
FrontPage 98, FrontPage 2000, FrontPage 2002 & FrontPage 2003.
There was also a freeware version included in earlier releases of Internet Explorer. If you have an older version of IE (If I am not mistaken this would be 4.0-5.0) it was found under Accessories. It was actually a useful web editor for those without access to the funds for purchasing software.
FrontPage is a WYSIWYG, "What You See Is What You Get", Web Editor. All versions of FrontPage are still in use by web developers all over the globe.
The 2003 version is the last installment to the series. It was replaced by "Expressions".
