The masks.
The members of the band wear masks because they were once working as office workers and they could not show their faces. After they became well known, they decided to keep wearing their masks. The masks became a trademark for the band. Also, one member says if they keep wearing their masks, they can keep their privacy and it will be easy to live normal lives.
