Mac OS X is the name of an operating system, or OS, that runs on computers made by Apple Inc. These are called Macintosh computers, or Macs. It is different from most other operating systems, because Mac OS X is made to run only on Macs and not on other computers. People have made it run on computers that are not Macs.
The "X" in Mac OS X, which is read aloud as "Mac Oh Ess Ten," comes from roman numerals. Mac OS X first came out in 2001, and is completely different than the Mac OS that it replaced. Mac OS X is a UNIX OS that is based on NEXTSTEP, an older OS that Apple bought and turned into Mac OS X. Mac OS X and NEXTSTEP have a background in a kind of UNIX called BSD. The core of Mac OS X is an open source OS called Darwin, but Darwin cannot run Mac OS X software.
Mac OS X releases are named after kinds of "big cats" and have a version number that starts with 10. The latest version of Mac OS X is called "Leopard" and is version 10.5. It was released on October 26, 2007. The next version is called "Snow Leopard".
