The British Railways Class D20/2 diesel-hydraulic locomotives were built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow during 1957 and 1958. Although never assigned a TOPS class as they were withdrawn before TOPS was introduced British Loco enthusiasts coined the term "Class 41". All were named after Royal Navy vessels, hence the nameplates each bore a subtitle "Warship Class".
