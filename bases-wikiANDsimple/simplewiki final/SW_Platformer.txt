A "platform game", or "platformer", is a video game where the player has to jump from and to platforms or over obstacles. The first platform games were made in the 1980s. In most games jumping from and to platforms is not the only thing the player has to do. If jumping from and to platforms is important in a game, it can be called a platformer.
