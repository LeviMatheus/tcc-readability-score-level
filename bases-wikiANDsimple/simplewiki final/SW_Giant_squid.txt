The giant squid is the biggest kind of squid in the world. Until 2005, nobody had ever seen a giant squid that was alive. Only dead giant squids had been found. In September 2005, scientists from Japan made videos of real living giant squids. Giant squids can grow to be up to 44 feet long (13 meters). Female (girl) giant squids are bigger than male (boy) giant squids.
