George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron (22 January 1788â€“19 April 1824), is commonly known as Lord Byron. He was an English poet and a leading figure in Romanticism. He was regarded as one of the greatest European poets and still many people read his works. Among his best-known works are the narrative poems "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage" and "Don Juan".
Lord Byron is also famous for the way he lived his life: extravagant living, many love affairs, debts, separation and for his fight against the Turks in the Greek War of Independence which lead to his death from a fever in Messolonghi in Greece. There were rumours that he was homosexual (which was against the law, at that time) and that he was guilty of incest. Lady Caroline Lamb, who was his lover for a time, said that he was "mad, bad, and dangerous to know."
His daughter Ada Lovelace is famous because she collaborated with Charles Babbage on the "analytical engine", a predecessor to modern computers.
