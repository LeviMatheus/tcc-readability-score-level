Sven-Göran Eriksson born February 5, 1948) is a Swedish football manager. He was recently the football manager of Manchester City after agreeing a 3-year-deal with the club. He is set to earn £2 million per year plus bonuses. He was sacked by Manchester City. Eriksson stepped down from his most recent position as the English national football team manager following England's exit from the 2006 World Cup; there was, however, considerable speculation that he was forced out by the English football authorities due to his tenure being punctuated by well-documented tabloid reports of his private life. Erikkson currently manages Mexico.
