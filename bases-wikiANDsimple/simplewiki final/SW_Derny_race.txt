A derny race is a race in which the cyclists are paced by someone riding a derny.
A Derny is a motorised bicycle designed and built for motor-paced cycling events (eg: motor-paced races in six-day and Keirin racing) or motor-paced road races.
The first Dernys were built by "Roger Derny et Fils" of Paris, France in 1938. That firm is no longer in business and any motorised bicycle for pacing is called a "Derny".
The rider of the derny usually sits upright, this makes it easier for the cyclist by reducing wind resistance.
The photographers' motorbikes used to help riders in ordinary races. That is why they were banned from riding in front of the cyclists.
