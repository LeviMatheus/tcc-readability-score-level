A headland is an area of land, which is surrounded by water on three sides. A bay is similar, it is a an area of water, enclosed by land on three sides. Very often, such land areas are called "cape", and the water areas also may be called "gulf". Headlands are made of hard rock and bays are made of soft rock and it takes the hard rock longer to erode.
A bay is a recess or inlet in the shore of a sea or lake between two headlands. The waves reaching the shore in a bay are usually constructive waves, and because of this, many of them have a beach. A bay may be metres across, or it could be hundreds of kilometres across. Bays form where weak rocks, such as sands and clays, are eroded, leaving bands of stronger rocks, such as chalk, limestone, or granite, forming a headland, or peninsula.
