In mathematics, an unknown is a number we don't know. In algebra, an unknown is represented by a letter. For example, in the equation "E" = "m" "c"2, the letter "m" represents an unknown mass, and the letter "E" represents an unknown amount of energy. Not all letters in algebra represent unknowns. In the example above, "c" represents a known quantity, the speed of light, which is about 186 thousand miles per second. Because "c" is so large, the formula "E" = "m" "c"2 tells a person who understands algebra that in an atomic reaction, a small amount of mass can produce a very large amount of energy.
