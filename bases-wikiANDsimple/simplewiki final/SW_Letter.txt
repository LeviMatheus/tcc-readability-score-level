There is a paper format called "Letter" or "US Letter". It is mainly used in the United States (see Paper size). Most other countries use the DIN paper sizes. The most common DIN paper size is A4.
Letters of the alphabet.
In some languages, for example English, we write a "letter" for all the sounds of the alphabet: when we write A, B, C, D etc, these are letters, or "letters of the alphabet". Other languages do not use letters for writing: Chinese, for example, uses "ideograms".
English, French, Spanish and many other languages use the Latin alphabet for writing. In this alphabet there are often two different letters for a sound. For example, "A" and "a". In other alphabets, for example the Cyrillic alphabet, there is only one letter for a sound. The letters are: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
