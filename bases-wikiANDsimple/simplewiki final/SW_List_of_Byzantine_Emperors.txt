This is a list of the Emperors of the late Eastern Roman Empire, called Byzantine by modern historians. This list does not include many of the emperors that rules with someone else.
The title of all Emperors before Heraclius was Augustus, but other titles such as Dominus were also used. After Heraclius, the title was changed to the Greek Basileus. This title used to mean "king", "sovereign" but now was used in place of Augustus. The emperors of the 15th century called themselves "Basileus ton Hellinon" ("Emperor of the Greeks") but they were still "Roman" Emperors.
This list begins with Constantine I the Great, the first Christian emperor reigning from Constantinople.
Palaiologan Dynasty (restored to Constantinople, 1259-1453).
At around this time the emperors began using the title "Βασιλευς Βασιλεων Βασιλευων Βασιλευσιν", that is, "King of Kings, ruling over Kings."
Ottomans.
In 1453 Mehmed II overthrew the Byzantine Empire and claimed the title of Kaisar; his successors continued this claim. See Ottomans for the complete list of Ottoman sultans.
