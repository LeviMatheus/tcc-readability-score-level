Pierre-Auguste Renoir (February 25, 1841â€“December 3, 1919) was a French artist. He was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau".
