The Zuiderzeewerken ("Zuiderzee Works") are a system of dams, land reclamation and water drainage works, and the] project undertaken by the Netherlands during the twentieth century.
Polders make new land for agriculture and make flood protection better, because the lake is smaller.
Plans for the works date back to the 1600s, but it was not until a very bad flood in 1916, that the Dutch parliament finally agreed to pay for the works.
First some dams or dykes were built to separate the Zuiderzee from the North Sea. The biggest was the "Afsluitdijk" ('closure dyke'). It is long. When it was finished in 1932, the Zuiderzee was completely dammed off and from then on would be called the "IJsselmeer".
There are gates and sluices, at the ends of the Afsluitdijk. The gates, called locks, can be opened to let ships through. The sluices let water out of the IJsselmeer. If there were no sluices the lake would fill up and flood the countryside. This isbecause it is always beingfilled with water from rivers and from the polders which are still being drained.
