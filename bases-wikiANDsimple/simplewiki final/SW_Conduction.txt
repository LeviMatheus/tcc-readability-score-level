Conduction in science is when energy moves from one places to another place. Heat and electricity are two kinds of energy that move by conduction. Something that energy can easily move through is a good conductor. Metal is a good conductor. An insulator is a bad conductor. Energy can not move quickly through an insulator. Plastics are one kind of insulator.
Example.
A pan of hot soup is taken off the oven and put on a table. The area of the table under the pot gets hot. Heat from the pot moved to the table top by conduction.
