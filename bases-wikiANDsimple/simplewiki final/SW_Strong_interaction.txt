The strong interaction, one of the four fundamental forces, is a force that acts between particles in the nucleus of an atom. It is what holds the nucleus together. Under the new QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics Theory), the strong force is carried by a particle called the gluon. The strong force is about 1.6666 x 1038 times the force of gravity and has a range of 1 x 10-15 metres. There are two types of strong force: residual and fundamental.
Fundamental/ Color Strong Force.
Fundamental, or color strong force is the nuclear force that acts between the three quarks of a proton. Quarks are the smallest particle currently known to man, and the only particle that we have not been able to break apart yet. The force carrier of the strong force is the gluon. Both quarks and gluons have properties that make them unique from other particles.
Residual Strong Force.
Residual strong force is the type of strong force that acts between hadrons (protons and neutrons). It is what holds the nucleus of an atom together. Alpha decay is a result of the residual strong force. This force is carried by pions. Among the particles that experience it are protons and neutrons. Each of these three particles has unique properties as well.
