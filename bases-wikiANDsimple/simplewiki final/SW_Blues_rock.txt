Blues Rock is a type of music which mixes blues with rock and roll, and uses mostly electric guitar as a main instrument. It began in the mid 1960s in England and the United States with bands such as Cream and The Rolling Stones, who experimented with music from the older bluesmen like Elmore James, Robert Johnson, Howlin' Wolf and Bo Diddley.
