Herakles (or Heracles) is a person in Greek mythology. He was the greatest of the Greek heroes, and he was given immortal life with the Olympic gods.
He is the son of the god Zeus and Alcmene, step-son of Amphitryon and great-grandson of Perseus. He and Theseus, king of Athens, had many adventures together, including those with the Amazon warriors.
He is shown with the lion skin and the club.
In Roman mythology he was named Hercules, and had different myths and practices than the Greek Herakles.
One of his most well known stories are "The Twelve Labours" (Greek name: "Dodekathlos").
The twelve labors is very one sided because there are some stories stating that Herakles only did nine labors and he had help on three so that didn't count.
