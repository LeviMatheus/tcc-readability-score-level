Quarks are smaller than atom particles that, for example, make up neutrons and protons.
Scientists had once believed that protons, neutrons, and electrons were fundamental particles that made up everything in the universe. This means that they cannot be broken down into simpler particles.
Then, they invented the particle accelerator and realized that there were, in fact, hundreds of other fundamental, even smaller particles that made up the protons and neutrons.
They found out that even these so called fundamental particles were actually just various arrangements of the even more basic quarks and leptons. There are six types of quarks (named Up, Down, Strange, Charm, Top and Bottom), and six types of leptons.
