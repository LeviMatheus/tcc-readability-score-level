Bangladesh consists of a number of administrative areas called divisions ("bibhag"), each named after its respective capital.
Each division is further split into districts ("zila") which are then further sub-divided into Upazilas.
History.
In 1983, the English spelling of the Dacca division (along with the name of the capital city) was changed to Dhaka to more closely match the Bangla pronunciation.
In 1993, Barisal division was off from Khulna and again in 1998, Sylhet division was split off from Chittagong giving rise to the 6 divisions in existence today.
