Sadism is a medical condition where people can derive pleasure from humiliating or hurting other people. Often, thr arousal has a sexual nature. In some cases, Sadism can also show in wanting to hurt or torture animals. Masochism may be similar, but in the case of masochism, the person is sexually aroused from being humiliated or hurt.
The first person to use the term sadism in a scientific way was Richard von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist. He named it after Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois Marquis de Sade who had written books where he mixed pornographic material with violent fantasies.
Originally, sadism and masochism were seen as a problem with sexual preference. This is no longer the case though, BDSM is clearly not classified that way.
No sexual motivation.
Erich Fromm said Heinrich Himmler probably showed this kind of sadism. There are no sexual motives behind this kind of sadism.
Sexual motivation.
This kind has sexual motives. Exerting power or being violent to other people or animals often is a source of sexual arousal. It can replace foreplay in some cases.
"Compensatory sadism" is when a sadistic action completely replaces sex.
Both sexually motivated sadism and compensatory sadism can lead to severe conflicts with the law. There are cases where those that fell prey to such people have been killed. These killings are the results of severe perversions, which are very rare. Extreme cases can take decades to develop. The people suffering from them can become serial killers, or they can direct their violence towards children.
Treating sadism.
Treating sadism is difficult, but it looks like psychotherapy can help in certain cases.
