Superman is a famous comic book character. He is possibly the first modern superhero character. He was created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1932, while they were still in high school. He first appeared in "Action Comics" issue #1 in 1938. Later, he appeared in movies, television series, cartoons, commercials, and radioshows. He is one of the most popular superheroes ever and the mascot of DC Comics.
Superman is from a planet called Krypton. His name was Kal-El. His father, Jor-El, found out that their planet was going to explode. Jor-El sent his baby son to Earth in a spacecraft to save him. Kal-El was found and adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent. They named him Clark Kent. The Kents raised him as their own son in a town called Smallville, Kansas in the United States. There is a television series called "Smallville" based on this time.
As he grows up, Clark finds out that he has special powers. He is indestructible (he cannot be hurt). He is strong enough to lift almost anything. He can fly. He can run and move faster than a bullet. He has X-ray vision (he can see through walls), and heat vision (he can shoot heat from his eyes). He can freeze things with his cold breath. He decides to use his special powers to fight crime and save people in danger. He wears a blue and red costume and cape to keep his alter ego (his real name) a secret. He saves the entire world many times.
He moves to a city called Metropolis, and becomes a reporter for the Daily Planet, a newspaper. He falls in love with another reporter, Lois Lane.
His only weakness is a radioactive rock from his home planet, called "kryptonite." It makes him sick and weak. His enemies use it to hurt him. Blue Kryptonite makes people be able to control him using hypnosis, green slowly kills him, and red takes away his powers. His worst enemy is a bald, evil genius named Lex Luthor.
