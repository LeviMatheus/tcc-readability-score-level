"UMD can also mean University of Maryland."
The Universal Media Disc (UMD) is an optical disc made by Sony for their PlayStation Portable. It holds 1.8 gigabytes of data. The disc can store games, music and video along with updates for the PSP. To prevent illegal copying, Sony has not made blank discs available for sale. This disc is not used with any other devices. The UMD is a very fragile CD, and can be broken from misuse. The first movie released on UMD was "Spider-Man".
