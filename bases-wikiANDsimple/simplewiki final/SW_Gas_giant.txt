A gas giant is a large planet that has a solid core, but a very thick atmosphere. This means that most of the planet is made up of gas. These planets are very large.
In our solar system, there are 4 gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Jupiter and Saturn are similar because they are made up of mostly hydrogen and helium. They both contain massive rocky cores bigger than Earth. Neptune and Uranus are similar because they are mainly made up of water and rock (a mixture of one or several minerals).
