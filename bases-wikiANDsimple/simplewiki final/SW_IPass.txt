iPass is a company that lets business users connect to the Internet when they are not in work or even on holiday. A laptop is usually used and can be used to connect from another city or country or even when at home.
For most countries in the world a dial-up service is available, using the laptop to call a local phone number that connects to the internet. Today it is also possible to use iPass with a wi-fi connection.
The main benefit of iPass is that a single account can be used without setup almost anywhere in the world. It is possible to do the same thing by signing up for local services, but this can be quite hard to do. But it is not free to use and it is usually expensive compared to normal internet connections.
