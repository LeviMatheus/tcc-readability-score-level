Esotericism is about secret knowledge for a small group of people. Esotericism also describes mystical, spiritual or occult viewpoints (point of view). Esotericism studies Gnosticism, Yoga, Alchemy, Magic, Astrology, Meditation, Mysticism, Occultism,
In history, "esoteric knowledge" generally described knowledge kept secret from outsiders by certain groups, such as the Freemasons, either to leave others out or to protect themselves against prejudice.
The opposite of esoteric knowledge is exoteric knowledge (well-known or public knowledge). If it is public knowledge then it is exoteric. If one keeps it to oneself then it is esoteric.
Since one cannot know what another person is thinking, one can say that what one thinks is esoteric if one keeps it to oneself. If one opens one's mouth and talks then it becomes public knowledge and is no longer esoteric but exoteric.
It seems that esotericism has to do with being able to keep a secret. If one cannot keep a secret, then one cannot do very well in an esoteric activity. One cannot be a member of a secret fraternity. One will not be trusted by a group made up of only a select few.
The general rule seems to be that nobody knows what one is thinking until one opens one's mouth.
There is a general saying in esotericism that goes something like this: those who know do not talk and those who talk do not know. People who know how to keep a secret do not tell others.
The sphinx is one of the symbols of esotericism.
The more one can talk about what one is thinking, the more one can leave something unsaid: this is very esoteric and very few people notice.
