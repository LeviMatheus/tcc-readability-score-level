Skinks are a group of lizard. They form the family "Scincidae", in the order Squamata. There are over 1,200 different kinds (species) of skink.
Skinks are different from other lizards. They have very small legs and necks. Some have no legs at all; these move more like snakes than lizards. Their tails can grow back when part of it is cut off. This is called "regeneration".
Most skinks can only grow to be 12cm long. Some can grow to be 35cm.
What skinks eat.
Many skinks are carnivorous, which means they eat meat. Some types of skinks eat both plants and meat, making them omnivores, or things that eat both plants and meat.
