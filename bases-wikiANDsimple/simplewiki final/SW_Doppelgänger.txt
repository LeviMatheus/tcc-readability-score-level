A Doppelgänger or a doppelganger is a German word used in English to talk about any double or someone that looks exactly like another person — most commonly an "evil twin." In some folklore, a doppelganger that is seen by a person's friends or family means the person will have illness or is in danger, while seeing your own doppelgänger means you will likely die. Some mythology offer more magic explanations, where the doppelganger is created by some kind of curse or through magic. These doppelgängers are usually, but not always, bad in some way. Doppelgängers can sometimes be seen in books, movies, and other fiction as part of their stories.
