Garbage is what someone leaves behind that they do not want to use anymore. It can also be called waste or rubbish. A definition of garbage is anything left behind at a place where you used to be, but are not anymore. In modern homes and businesses, however, garbage is normally separated and put where it can be collected and taken to a place designed to hold ("landfill"), burn ("incinerate")), or recycle garbage.
