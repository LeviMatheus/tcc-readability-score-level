A quasar (or Quasi-Stellar Radio Source) happens when gas around a black hole goes in the black hole. As the gas gets close to the black hole itself, it heats up from a process called friction, and glows so brightly that this light can be seen on the other side of the Universe. It is often brighter than the whole galaxy the quasar is in. No one is sure what quasars are for but since the 1980's scientist have tried to find out.
