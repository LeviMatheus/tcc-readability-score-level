24 Themis is one of the biggest Main belt asteroids. It is also the biggest member of Themistian asteroid family.
It was found by Annibale de Gasparis on April 5, 1853. The mass and diameter appearing in the table are from different sources, and combining them gives an unusually high density, which is most probably wrong. The mass has very likely been overestimated by a factor of at least five times.
It is named after Themis, the personification of divine order, law and custom in Greek mythology.
