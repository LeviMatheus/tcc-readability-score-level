When people feel or think the same way about something, they agree. Sometimes it is important to write down or make a promise to what has been agreed on. This is called an agreement. Agreements are common in law and business. For example, when a person takes out a loan or hires someone to work, an agreement is usually signed so everyone understands what must be done and in what time it must be done.
