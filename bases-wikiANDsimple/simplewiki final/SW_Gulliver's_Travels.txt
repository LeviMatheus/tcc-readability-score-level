"Gulliver's Travels" is a 1726 book by Jonathan Swift. This book is fiction, meaning it is an untrue story, about Lemuel Gulliver and his journeys to four countries.
The four countries are Lilliput, a land of little people, Brobdingnag, a land of big people, Laputa, a land of intelligent but useless people, and Houyhnhnm, a land of horses.
The story is funny and many children like it. However, Swift wrote it for adults because he wanted to show his readers that some people and governments were wrong. He wrote this story so these people would change.
