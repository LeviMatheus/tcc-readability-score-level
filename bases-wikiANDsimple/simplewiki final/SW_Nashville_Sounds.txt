The Nashville Sounds are a minor league baseball team from Nashville, Tennessee. They play at the Triple-A (AAA) level, the most difficult level before Major League Baseball, against other baseball teams in the Pacific Coast League (a group of 16 baseball teams at the same level). When a player shows that he plays well at this level, he is moved up to the team's partner, the Milwaukee Brewers, which is a Major Leage Baseball team.
The Sounds started playing in 1978 at Herschel Greer Stadium (the name of the stadium where they play baseball). They have won the championship in their league three (3) times: 1979, 1982, and 2005.
The team is named "Sounds" because Nashville, the city where the team plays, is famous for making Country music.
