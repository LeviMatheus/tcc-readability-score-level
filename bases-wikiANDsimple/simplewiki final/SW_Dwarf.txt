A dwarf is a short, humanlike creature in Norse mythology as well as other Germanic mythologies, fairy tales, fantasy, fiction and role-playing games.
A dwarf can also be a short human. Often "dwarf" is used as an insult for short people, but some people have a genetic condition which was called dwarfism. Not all short people have this condition.
