"Lounge Act" is a song by the American grunge band Nirvana. It was the 9th song on their second album, "Nevermind", which made the band very popular. The song is much like the post-grunge songs that were very popular starting in the mid-1990s, after Nirvana broke up.
The title "Lounge Act" came from when the band thought it sounded like a song they would play in a lounge.
It is one of the songs in the soundtrack of the video game "Skate.", a skateboarding video game from 2007 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.
