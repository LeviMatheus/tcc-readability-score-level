A sash is of a cloth belt used to hold a robe together, and usually tied about the waist. The Japanese equivalent of a sash, called an "obi", serves to hold a kimono together. Decorative sashes may pass from the shoulder to the hip rather than around the waist. Sashes traditionally form part of formal military uniform and the Royal attire.
