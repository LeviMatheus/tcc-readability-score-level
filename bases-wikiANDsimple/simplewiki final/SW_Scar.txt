A scar is the natural result of a healing process in the human body. When the deeper layer (scientists call that "dermis") is hurt by a wound, the wounded tissue will be replaced by scar tissue. Scar tissue is not identical to the tissue it replaces. A scar will look different (and have different characteristics) than the surrounding tissue.
