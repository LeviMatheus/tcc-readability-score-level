Mosleh Zamani (also referred as Moslah Zamani) is now 21-year old Iranian-Kurdish boy from Sanandaj, who is facing execution for "adultery" (under Iranian law, every sexual contacts outside marriage, even if both people are unmarried, is adulterous).
Mosleh, who was arrested at age of 17 and spend four years in prison, was recently sentenced to death by hanging.
His case raised strong controversies, because of both nature of his crime and fact he was 17 year old (Iran, because of international obligations, is not permitted to sentence anyone to death for crime he or she had committed under age of 18).
Now the only person, who could commute the death sentence is Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, the head of the judiciary.
