A Time server is a special computer in a Computer network.
It is important that computer on a network have a common idea of time. Time servers are computers with special software on them. They either use an atomic clock, or they ask other computers on the network about the time. They then make this time available to all the other computers in the same network. Common protocols used to do this are the DAYTIME protocol and the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
Dedicated Time Server [NTP] delivers the time directly into LAN network using NTP and SNTP protocols. It is equipped with multiple independent Ethernet interfaces. UTC reference time is drawn simultaneously from different clocks via GPS or RF AM. It has build-in oscillators (rubidium, ocxo, tcxo) stabilized in PLL/FLL against 1PPS frequency reference. This device is ready for continuous operation 24h/ day and is able to provide simultaneous synchronization to 10 000 NTP clients: servers, routers and workstations.
