Strict construction means a restriction of judicial interpretation. In the United States the phrase is also commonly used more loosely as a term for conservativism among the judiciary.
Strict sense of the term.
In its strict sense, strict construction requires a judge to apply the text as it is written and no further, if the meaning of the text is clear. That is, judges should avoid drawing inference from a statute or constitution.
For example, Justice Hugo Black argued that the First Amendment's injunction that "Congress shall make no law," should be construed strictly: the term "no law," Black thought, admitted virtually no exceptions.
