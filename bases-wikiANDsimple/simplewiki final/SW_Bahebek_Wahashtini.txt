"Bahebek Wahashtini" is a song written and sung by Emarati pop star Hussein El Jesmy, the song serves as the theme music for the popular Arabic film "Al Rahina (2006)", or "The Hostage".
The words, when translated in Arabic to English, means "I love you and I've missed you"; this, of course, parallells the intimacy and loyalty that the character within the movie has for his mother country, Egypt.
