A muffin is a small bread- or cake-like baked food. Muffins look cupcakes: they have round bases, rounded tops, and are usually sweet, but there are also savory kinds (like cornbread muffins). They fit in the palm of an adult hand, and are meant to be eaten by one person in a single sitting. A "muffin" can also mean a different baked food, the smaller, disk-shaped English muffin, although this is not common outside Britain. In Britain, the term can mean either muffin. Muffins often have a "topping" baked in, such as blueberries or chocolate chips.
