Aum (also spelled Om), is the most sacred symbol in Hinduism. Hindu scriptures tell many things about this symbol. In Hinduism, Aum is like calling god's name towards you. This name is generally said three times, before chanting any prayers. Om is usually related to the Hindu God [Shiva]who is the creater and the destroyer. He has a third eye that does all the destroying when it opens when Shivji gets angry.
