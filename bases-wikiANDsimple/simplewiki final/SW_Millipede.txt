Millipedes are arthropods. They have very long bodies. Millipedes are segmented. They have between 20 to over 100 segments. Except for the first few segments, each segment has 2 pairs of legs. So far, about 10.000 different species of millipedes have been identified. The animals are detrivores, they eat what is left over. In most of the cases, this is decaying leaves and other plant matter. Most millipedes are poisonous. This protects them from being eaten. They are usually slow movers.
They can easily be told apart from centipedes. Centipedes move faster, and only have one pair of legs per segment.
Millipedes were among the first animals to colonize the land.
