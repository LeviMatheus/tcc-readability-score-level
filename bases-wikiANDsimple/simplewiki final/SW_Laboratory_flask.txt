Laboratory flasks are containers made of glass which are usually used in scientific laboratories. Flasks are made in different shapes and sizes. Their size are chosen by the volume they can hold, and is measured in metric units, like leters (L) or mililiters (mL). Their shape depends on what they are used for, but they usually consist of a body which contains the materials, and a neck which is they way to insert materials into the body. Some modern flasks are made of plastic.
Flasks can be used to make and hold solutions, to measure chemicals, and to contain chemical reactions like boiling, precipitation and analysis.
