"Homo erectus" (Latin: "upright man") is an extinct species of the genus "Homo". Fossile remains were found in Java (1890s) and in China (1921). But nearly all of them were lost during World War II. But there are casts that are considered to be reliable evidence.
Early in the 20th century it was believed that the first modern humans lived in Asia. But during the 1950s and 1970s, many fossil finds from East Africa (Kenya) showed that the oldest hominins came from there.
