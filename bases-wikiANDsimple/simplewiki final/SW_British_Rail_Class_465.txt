The British Rail Class 465 "Networker" electric multiple units were built by Metropolitan Cammell and BREL between 1991 and 1993, and by ABB Rail between 1993 and 1994. They were brought into service from 1991 onwards. They are mostly used on suburban routes serving the South East of England, now operated by Southeastern.
