Intelligent Design is the idea that the universe is not simple enough to be made by nature. Instead, people who believe Intelligent Design think that a smarter force must have made everything. Intelligent Design is the idea that the types of plants and animals around us were not made using evolution. Overall, scientists do not think that there are good reasons to believe Intelligent Design. Many people think that Intelligent Design is a form of Creationism or just another name for it. In 2005, in the Dover trial, a United States judge decided that Intelligent Design was creationism in disguise to try to get around the First Amendment.
