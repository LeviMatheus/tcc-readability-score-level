Deep Ng (吳浩康; born 吳偉男 on 13 June 1983) is a Hong Kong singer and actor of the Emperor Entertainment Group.
He was fined 5,000 USD because of keeping cocaine (an illegal drug).
He was charged of beating Chim Chi Kin at the Boozeroo Pub in Tsim Sha Tsui on 11 July 2005. On November 21, 2005, the court ruled that he did not committed the crime, because what the victim said seemed not to match his own words.
Deep also acted in movies like "New Police Story". He is also famous for his number 1 hit song, "Select the Breakup Day" (擇日失戀). A new album, "Nowhere" (pronounced as Now-here), was sold in public in September 2005. This album was seen as a comeback for Deep after a number of bad news. He also had another new album, "Documentary", in 2006.
He was once the boyfriend of Nancy Wu, a Hong Kong artist.
