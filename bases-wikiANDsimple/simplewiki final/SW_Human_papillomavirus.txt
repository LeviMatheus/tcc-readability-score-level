The Human papillomaviruses are a group of papillomaviruses. These viruses usually can infect the skin or mucous membranes (like the genitals, or inside the mouth) of animals and humans. Usually they cause warts. Some of them may cause cancer. There are over 100 different virus types in this group. About 30 virus types can be transmitted sexually. About 12-15 can cause cancer.
A first step in treatment is the use of salicylic acid. This is available in pharmacies, usually without a prescription. If this does not help, the wart can be frozen, and destroyed that way, or a laser can be used to destroy it. If this still does not help, different methods of chemotherapy can be used.
