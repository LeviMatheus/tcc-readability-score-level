Halaal (حلال, halāl, halal) is an Islamic Arabic term meaning "permissible".
It has both a general and specific meaning.
When people use the word in Islamic countries, they usually mean to say "what is allowed by Islamic Law".
In non-islamic countries, the word usually means "fit to be eaten by a Muslim".
When Jewish people say something is "Kashrut" (or Kosher), they mean a similar thing except Jewish people are allowed to have alcohol which is made from grapes(made in a certain way of course).
