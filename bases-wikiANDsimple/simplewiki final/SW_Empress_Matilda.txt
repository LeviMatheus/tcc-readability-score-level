Empress Matilda (c. February 1101 - 10 September 1167), sometimes referred to as Empress Maud, was the second child of Henry I of England and Matilda of Scotland. She was Queen of England for a short time in 1141. She fought against King Stephen who was the nephew of Henry I. Their argument ended when Matilda's son, Henry, was named by King Stephen as his successor at the treaty of Wallingford in 1153. This happened because Stephen's own chosen successor, his son Eutace, died in 1153.
