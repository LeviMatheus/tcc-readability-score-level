Germany is divided into 429 administrative districts. There are 313 rural districts ("Landkreise"), listed here, and 116 urban districts ("Kreisfreie StÃ¤dte" / "Stadtkreise") listed in List of German urban districts).
In some cases the government of the rural district is not based in the district, but in an independent city nearby.
