When we say Baltic Paganism we actually mean many different religions and mythologies that people had in Baltic countries before Christianity and that some people still have. All of those religions have their own features but also between these religions many things are similar. Baltic pagans just like Scandinavian and Finnish pagans believes that greatest god is a male god of sky and thunder. He has a hammer or axe that makes lightning. This belief is very old. We think that in Stone Age Corded Ware culture already had this kind of a god and that his weapon was boat shaped stone axe. Corded Ware culture lived in large area and many features of Nordic and Baltic people are from it.
