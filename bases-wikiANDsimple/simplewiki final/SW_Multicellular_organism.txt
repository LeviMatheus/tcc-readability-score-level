When people talk about multicellular organisms, they mean organisms that has more than one cell. This is the case for most animals and plants that can be seen (without the use of a microscope).
In such organisms, cells are usually specialised. All the cells with the same function group together. Such a group of cells is then called tissue.
Multicellular organisms have a set of cells that specialize in reproduction. Reproduction in such organisms is usually sexual. This means that there are germ cells. These are either sperm or ovum (also named "egg") cells. If they are sperm cells, the organism is male, if they are egg cells it is female. If both are present, the organism is a hermaphrodite.
Cancer occurs when certain cells of a tissue are unable... to regulate their growth, and grow in an uncontrollable manner.
