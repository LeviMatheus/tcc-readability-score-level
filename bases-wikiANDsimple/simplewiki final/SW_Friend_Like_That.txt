Music video.
The music video for Friend Like That shows the band in a cartoon world. The singer, Jason Dunn is running while other members of the band wait patiently for him to reach them. Then they get into the bus and drive. During the breakdown, some of them are singing in the van. They get off the van and go through a door, to find themselves playing a Live concert on stage.
