Biologically, a woodland is an area with trees that is not a forest. A woodland allows sunlight to penetrate between the trees, therefore there is little shade. In a forest the branches and foliage of trees are so dense that there is continuous shade.
Woodlands may support an understory of shrubs, herbs, or grasses.
