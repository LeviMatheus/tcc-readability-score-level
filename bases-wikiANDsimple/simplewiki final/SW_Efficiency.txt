The term efficiency means that a person or machine do good work without spending too much resources, that means energy, material, capital and labour.
Machines are efficient when they can do their task without wasting energy. An efficient car can go farther with less fuel; an efficient spacecraft can fly in space without bringing a heavy tank of rocket fuel with it.
