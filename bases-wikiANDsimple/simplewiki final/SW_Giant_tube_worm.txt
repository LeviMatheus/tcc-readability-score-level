Giant tube worms are annelids. They live on the floor of the oceans, usually near Black Smokers. They can tolerate extremely high temperatures and levels of sulfur. They live in symbiosis with certain bacteria. These bacteria are fed with sulfur compounds and oxygen. The bacteria then turn these compounds into organic molecules on which the host worms feed.
