A natural disaster is the consequence of the combination of a natural hazard (a physical event like a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, a landslide) and human activities.
Only if humans are there where the hazard happens and if they have no sufficient emergency management, there will be human losses. Therefore one can say: "disasters occur when hazards meet vulnerability". A natural hazard will therefore have no natural disaster as a result in areas without vulnerability, that means if for example a strong earthquake is in uninhabited areas.
