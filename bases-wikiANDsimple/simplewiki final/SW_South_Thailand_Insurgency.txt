South Thailand Insurgency is a violence that has happened in the 3 provinces of Thailand. There are Naratiwat Pattanee, and Yala. There are many severe attacks.
There are ambush, commit arson, bomb, terrorize, and disturbance.
It has started on 7 November 2004 until now. It’s one of the biggest problems in Thailand. The people are all interested about this and all pray that one day this problem will fade away from Thailand. It’s started from the conflict of Thai-Muslim and disagreeable people. That are effected to Thai-Muslim for long time. Since it has happened, some families had to move out from the site because those bad people changed their life. They were also scare of what would happen with them, and their family’s members. Some families lose their fathers while the fathers were working. However, not only the people who have been related in this situation, but even the adults. Adults are used to be the equipment of these criminals. Some schools have to close because the criminals always bomb the schools. Thailand have wasted many brave soilders by this situation. Children can’t stay away from the houses. Everything is changing. In the past,Thailand was a very peaceful country. We hope everthing is going to be alright, soon.
