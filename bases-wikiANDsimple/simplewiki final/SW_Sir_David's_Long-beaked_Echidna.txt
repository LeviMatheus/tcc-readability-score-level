Sir David's Long-beaked Echidna ("Zaglossus attenboroughi"), also known as the Cyclops Long-beaked Echidna, is one of three species from the genus "Zaglossus". All of them occur in New Guinea. It is named in honour of Sir David Attenborough. It lives in the Cyclops mountains in Papua province of Indonesia near the cities of Sentani, Jayapura.
The species was described from a single damaged animal, which was collected in the Dutch colonial era (c. 1961). It has not been collected since that time. The Cyclops mountain forest habitat has been disturbed recently. This has raised concern that "Z. attenboroughi" populations may already be endangered or even locally extinct. However, it is important to note that biological surveys of Papua province are often incomplete and it is possible that the animal still exists there or in related mountain ranges.
It is the smallest member of the genus. It is closer in size to the Short-beaked Echidna than other members of the genus. It has five claws on its fore and hind feet. It has dense short fur.
