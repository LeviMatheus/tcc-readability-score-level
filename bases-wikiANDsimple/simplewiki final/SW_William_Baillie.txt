Captain William Baillie (June 5, 1723 - December 22, 1810) was an Irish military man and artist.
Baillie went to London at age of 18 to study law, but liked art more. Shortly after getting to London, he joined the army. He served at the Battle of Culloden and retired with the rank of Captain. Baillie was later made the Commissioner of Stamps, which he was until 1795.
A book of prints, after the above artists, was published in 1792, in two volumes, with subsequent editions.
