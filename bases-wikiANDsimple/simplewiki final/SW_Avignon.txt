Avignon is a city in the south of France. It is the administrative capital of the Vaucluse. About 89.000 people live in the city today, and about 155.000 in its urban area. The first foundations of the city were around 539 before the birth of Christ.
During the Midlle Ages, the city was the seat of the popes.
Today, a very well preserved old city remains, also the Palais of the Popes, and the Bridge ("Pont d'Avignon") are worth a visit.
