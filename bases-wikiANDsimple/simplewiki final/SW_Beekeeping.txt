Beekeeping or apiculture is the farming of honeybees.
Uses.
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for honey. Now it is increasingly used for crop pollination and other products. These are wax and propolis. Queen bees do not control their hives; they lay eggs they are known as the "egg layers" of the hive. They are bigger than other types of bees.
Types of beekeeping.
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a hobby.
