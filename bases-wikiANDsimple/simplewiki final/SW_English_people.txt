English people are people who are from or live in England. Most English people speak the English language. Over the years, many English people have moved to other countries, such as the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
The English are one of the nations of the island of Great Britain, which they share with the Scots and the Welsh. The ancestors of the English came to Great Britain from mainland Europe in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries. They are traditionally called the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.
