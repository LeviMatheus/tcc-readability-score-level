A sandbox or sandpit is a small area filled with sand made for children to play in. Sandboxes are often square and often have wooden sides. They are in playgrounds, but can be in homes as well. Sandboxes or Sandpits are also very popular for making sandcastles. However, some animals use them for litter trays. They are in most elementary schools and in back yards and can also be made of plastic and in the shapes of different reptiles and animals. They are mostly made for the purpose of entertaining the imagination of young children.
