A Variable focus lens (also called Zoom lens) is a camera lens that can vary its focal length.
In general, such lenses have a lower aperture than comparable fixfocus lenses. Depending on the manufacturer common zoom lenses (in the 30-100mm focal range, for film photography) usually have a varying aperture, from 4-5.6, perhaps 3.3-5.6. There are also some zoom lenses with a fixed maximal aperture (to take the example from before: Of 2.6 or 2.8, maximum). In contrast, fix-focus lenses in that range have maximum apertures of 1.4 to 2.
