An album is a collection of sound recordings. It is usually made by a musician, and is sold in stores to people. Albums today come in the form of compact discs. Some musicians make albums on vinyl records that can be played on record players.
Types of albums.
There are two main types of albums, studio albums and live albums. Studio albums are recorded at a recording studio. Live albums are normally recorded while the musicians are performing for an audience. Live albums are usually recorded at concerts.
Tracks== .
Albums are normally separated into "Tracks". Each track is a part of the album which has one song in it. The term is often used to mean a specific song on the album by number. For example, the "forth track" or "track four" from an album is the forth song on the album when it is played from the beginning.
