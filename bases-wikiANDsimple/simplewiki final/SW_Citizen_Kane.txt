"Citizen Kane" is a movie from 1941, starring the famous Orson Welles in his first full-length movie. There are rumours that the story of the movie is based on the life of famous business people William Randolph Hearst, Howard Hughes and Samuel Insull. Welles said that his character, Kane, is based on more than one famous person. In 1974's "F for Fake", he said that Kane was going to be based on Hughes, but he was later inspired by Hearst.
For this movie Orson Welles worked closely with his cinematographer Gregg Toland. The cinematographer is the person in charge of the camera and the lights. Together, they worked on a new style called "deep focus." Usually, if something close to the camera is in focus, something that is far away is out of focus. In the deep focus style, every object is in focus at the same time.
Its working title (the name of a movie used before it is finished) was "RKO 281".
Many have called "Citizen Kane" the best movie of all time. In 1998, it was number one on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Years... 100 Movies.
The movie in some ways is like 1933's "The Power and the Glory".
The last living crew member was director Robert Wise (also known for making 1965's "The Sound of Music"). He died on September 14, 2005.
