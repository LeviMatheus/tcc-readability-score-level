A conflict is a problem. The word comes from Latin "conflingere" (which has the past participle "conflictum"). Conflingere means "to come together for a battle". Conflicts can either be within one person, or they can involve several people. Conflicts arise because there are needs, values or ideas that are seen to be different, and there is no means to reconcile them.
Very often, conflicts lead to fights, or even wars (in the case where conflicts are solved with arms).
