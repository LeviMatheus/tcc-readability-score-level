Marriage is a union between a man and a woman. It is like a contract. Sometimes people also call this matrimony. The fact of being married is called wedlock. Very often, people celebrate that they are getting married. The ceremony is usually called wedding.
The most common form of marriage is that between a man and a woman. Some societies recognise polygamy. In polygamy, a man may be married to many women; in polyandry a woman may be married to many men. In Senegal, for example, nearly 47 percent of marriages are multiple.
Some countries and religious communities also permit the union of two partners of the same sex. This is generally known as same-sex marriage. In the Netherlands, the marriage law was changed to allow such unions, called "Marriage". Other countries that allow them sometimes have a different name for them.
Usually there is also a spiritual part of marriage. In addition to the civil act (wanted by the state) there is sometimes a religious one. If both partners are Christians, they may marry in a church, for example. There are certain restrictions on who can marry or be married; those closely related, like brothers and sisters usually cannot marry. This is usually to prevent problems for the children. Those marrying also have to be of a certain age to be able to marry. If that age is not specified it is usually the age of consent.
A wedding usually consists of the couple exchanging vows and a party afterward. The man getting married is called the groom, and the woman getting married is called the bride.
Marriage is also about sexual intercourse; being unable to have sex, or being unwilling to have sex may be a reason to undo the marriage.
In Indian culture marriage is considered to be holy and divine and is a union of Goddess "Laxmi" and God "Narayan".
