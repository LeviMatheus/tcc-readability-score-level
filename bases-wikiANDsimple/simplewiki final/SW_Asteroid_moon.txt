An Asteroid Moon is an asteroid that orbits or goes around another asteroid. Asteroid moons are quite rare. Only 2% of asteroids are thought to have moons.
To be an asteroid moon an asteroid has to be smaller than the object it goes around. If they are roughly the same size they are called a binary pair.
