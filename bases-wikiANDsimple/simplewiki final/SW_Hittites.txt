The Hittites were an ancient people from Kane≈° who spoke an Indo-European language, and established a kingdom centered at Hattusa (Hittite URU') in north-central Anatolia from the 18th century BC.
After 1180 BC, the empire disintegrated into several independent "Neo-Hittite" city-states, some surviving until as late as the 8th century BC.
