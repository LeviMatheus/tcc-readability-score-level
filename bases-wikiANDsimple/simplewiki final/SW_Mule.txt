A mule is a horse-donkey hybrid (a mix of two different animals). It is the child of a female horse and a male donkey.
They are used mostly for pulling carts and transportation. Although it is extremely unlikely for a mule to become pregnant (less than 300 reported cases worldwide), it is possible.
