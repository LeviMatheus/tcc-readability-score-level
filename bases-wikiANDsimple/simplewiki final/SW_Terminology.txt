Terminology is the study of terms and their use. Terms are words and compound words that are used in specific contexts. Not to be confused with "terms" in everyday usages, the shortened form of technical terms (or terms of art) which are defined within an academic system or a field of specialty. Terminology studies among other things how such terms of art come to be and their interrelationships within a culture.
Terminology therefore refer to a more formal discipline which systematically studies the "labelling or designating of concepts" specific to one or more subject fields or domains of human activity, through research and analysis of terms in context, for the purpose of documenting and promoting correct usage. This study can be limited to one language or can cover more than one language at the same time ("multilingual terminology", "bilingual terminology", and so forth) or may focus on studies of terms used in teaching across different fields.
