DiBiase first appeared on WWE television on May 26, 2008, where he said he was going to become a champion like his father, Ted DiBiase, and challenged the World Tag Team Champions, Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly. At Night of Champions, DiBiase won the World Tag Team Championship in his first match in WWE, after Rhodes turned on Holly, and decided to team up with DiBiase. They held the titles for a month, but then lost them to John Cena and Batista on August 4. The next week, DiBiase and Rhodes had a rematch, and won the titles back.
DiBiase and Rhodes were joined by Manu, but on the October 27, 2008 episode of "Raw", DiBiase and Rhodes lost their championship to CM Punk and Kofi Kingston. DiBiase was then taken off television, so he could film the movie "The Marine 2".
