The United Nation Environment Programme's Indian Solar Loan Programme has won the "World award for Sustainability" for helping to establish a householder loan program for solar home power systems.
Over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, mainly in areas of South India where the electricity grid does not yet extend.
