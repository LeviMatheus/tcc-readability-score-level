A conductor is a material which electricity can flow through. Most metals, like iron and copper, are conductors. These metals are used to make wires.
Some materials are semi-conductors. This means that electricity "can" flow through them, but not very well.
Some materials are resistors. This means that they make it very hard for electricity to flow through them.
Some materials are insulators. This means that they stop electric current completely. Wires are covered with insulators like plastic to stop the electricity from leaving the wire.
