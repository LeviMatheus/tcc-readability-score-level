Popular culture is culture enjoyed by some Westernized people. It can include Hollywood, Bollywood, Broadway, video games, computer games, music, or other concepts and ideas for young people to experience. Compared to plain culture, popular culture is often controversial and objects of popular culture have been banned in non-Western countries like Malaysia, for example. Most popular culture involves complex art and sometimes violence and/or profane language are used to appeal to a young adult male audience raised on watching R-rated movies with a parent or supervising adult at any much earlier age than the Baby Boomer generation.
