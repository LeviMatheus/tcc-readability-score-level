A Unicorn is an animal from fiction. It looks like a horse or goat, with one horn on its head. The word "unicorn" comes from the Latin word "unus", which means "one", and "cornu" which means "horn".
Unicorns are in many stories from different parts of the world. Its blood and horn usually have mystical powers. Its horn (often called "alicorn" in medieval literature) has the power to heal wounds and sickness, and to neutralize poison.
In some pictures unicorns also have goat's feet or a lion's tail.
