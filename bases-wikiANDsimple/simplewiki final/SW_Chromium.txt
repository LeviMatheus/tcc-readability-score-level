Chromium is a chemical element. Its symbol on the periodic table (a list of all the elements) is Cr'". Its atomic number is 24. (The atomic number says where chromium sits in the periodic table.)
Chromium is a shiny metal. It is pretty reactive. It forms compounds (a combination of more than one element), and these compounds are colorful. They can be green, yellow, or maybe even other colors.
There are different types of chromium. One type of chromium ("chromium-3", which says how many electrons have been lost) is required by our body and by those of other animals. If we do not get enough chromium, certain parts of our body may not work properly. We get most of the chromium we need from our food we eat. Chromium is also put into vitamins to make sure that we get enough. If we get too much of this type of chromium, it can harm our body. Another type of chromium ("chromium-6" or "hexavalent chromium") can cause cancer or make people sick, even though most people do not get exposed to it much. Chromium-6 was important in the movie "Erin Brockovich".
Chromium is used in different metal products. When it is mixed with other metals (the mixes are called alloys), it can make them stronger. Many people know about chromium from their "chrome wheels" on their cars. Chromium metal covers the wheels, and makes them shiny.
