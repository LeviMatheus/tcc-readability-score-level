A litre (liter in the United States) is the metric unit of volume.
One litre is the volume of one cubic decimetre, that is a cube of 10 x 10 x 10 centimetre. A litre of water has a mass of about one kilogram.
The abbreviation of litre is L or l. For smaller volumes the millilitre is used: 1000 ml = 1 l.
The capital letter abbreviation "L" is preferred by some people as the small "l" can look like the number one "1".
