A laxative is a food or drug taken to make bowel movements easier, or to treat constipation. Sometimes taking powerful or lots of laxatives can cause diarrhea or a flatulence.
Laxatives work by helping your intestines digest undigested food, and don't make you lose weight. Despite this, some people with eating disorders take laxatives in an attempt to lose weight.
