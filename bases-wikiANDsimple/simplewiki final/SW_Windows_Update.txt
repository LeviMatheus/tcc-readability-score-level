History.
Windows Update first became part of windows with the launch of Windows 98. Since then the Windows Update site has gone through many updates.
With the release of Windows ME a feature called Automatic Updates was added; this meant updates could be installed in the background.
In Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 instead of using a Windows Update website you now use a application to receive your updates in windows.
