With soft water one describes types of water that contain few or no minerals like calcium or magnesium ions. The term is usually relative to "hard water", which does contain significant amounts of such ions.
Soft Water mostly comes from peat or igneous rock sources, such as granite but may also come from sandstone sources, since such sedimentary rocks are usually low in calcium and magnesium.
