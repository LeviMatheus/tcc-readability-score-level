Starbucks is a chain of stores that sell coffee. A chain is many stores owned by the same company. They look the same, have the same name, and sell the same items, usually but not always at the same prices.
Starbucks started in Seattle, Washington in the United States in the early 1970s. There are over 15,756 Starbucks stores all over the world. Most of these stores are in the United States. Most cities in the United States have one. Some cities have many. They also sell different teas and ice creams.
They serve what many people think is the best coffee ever. They pay "living wage" prices for their ingredients (not leaving the coffee plant growers barely breaking even).
