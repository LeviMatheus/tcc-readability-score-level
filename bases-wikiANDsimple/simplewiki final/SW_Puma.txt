Pumas ("Puma concolor"), also called cougars or mountain lions, are large wild cats that live on the west coast of Canada, in the western half of the United States and Florida, and most of Central and South America. Cougars are mainly tan-coloured, and can be up to 1.85 metres long. Most pumas live 21 years.
Cougars are carnivores because they eat only meat. They hunt deer, raccoons, squirrels, foxes, rabbits and skunks. They can also eat mice, beavers, coyotes, birds and porcupines. They hunt at night. Cougars can see better at night than people can. They can hear well too. Cougars stalk their prey. That is, they walk slowly and quietly, they hide and then when close, they jump or run fast to catch their prey. They live and hunt alone.
In Canada, cougars live in the mountains and forests far from people.
