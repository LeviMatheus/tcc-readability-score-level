A barnacle is an animal. It is a kind of crustacean that grows on different hard surfaces like piers, boats, and on rocks. Barnacles are family of crabs and shrimps. They are considered mostly a nuisance to the shipping industry and private boat owners. Barnacles are filter feeders, which means that they suck in water and filter out different things like plankton to use as food. The barnacles send out little larvae that land on other hard surfaces and start to create hard shells, forming new barnacles.
