Frederick William Herschel (November 15 1738 - August 25 1822) was a British astronomer. He was born in Germany, but moved to England in 1755. He is best known for discovering the planet Uranus in 1781. He lived in England most of his life.
When he discovered Uranus, Herschel was not looking for a planet but a comet; it was an accidental discovery.
William Herschel used to work with his sister Caroline Herschel. She was a dutiful sister who used to wrote up all his observations as he had no time to write them himself.
On 25 August 1822, Herschel died at Observatory House, Windsor Road, Slough, and is buried at nearby St Laurence's Church, Upton. Ironically, he died in his 84th year, which is the same number of years which Uranus takes to orbit the Sun.
