Sir Thomas Cavendish (or Candish) (1560 - 1592) was an English sea explorer. He was known as "the Navigator" because he led the third expedition to travel around ("circumnavigate") the globe. Cavendish was the first who set sail to do this. Magellan and Francis Drake were the first two to circumnavigate the globe, but they did not intend to do so. Cavendish died at sea on his second voyage around the world.
