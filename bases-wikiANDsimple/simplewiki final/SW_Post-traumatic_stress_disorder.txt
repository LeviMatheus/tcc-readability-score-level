Post-traumatic stress disorder (sometimes also written "Posttraumatic stress disorder", often shortened to "PTSD") is a disease linked to anxiety.
It can develop when people are severely harmed, or experience something extremely upsetting.
PTSD is different from traumatic stress, which is less intense and of shorter duration, and combat stress reaction, which is transitory. PTSD has also been recognized in the past as shell shock, traumatic war neurosis, or post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS).
