Tropical is a word that means "near the equator". Near the equator it is hot, wet, and many plants grow so hot places are sometimes called tropical even if they are not inside the tropics. There are places in the tropics that aren't hot. Places that are high up can be cold. There are even some places in the tropics where snow can be found such as Mauna Kea, which is a very big volcano in Hawaii, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Central Africa, and the Andes mountains which is a mountain rage in Chile and Argentina which are two countries in South America. Tropical people have different names for seasons, even though the seasons are the same in the [tropics] as in other places. Tropical people call the seasons dry and wet seasons.
