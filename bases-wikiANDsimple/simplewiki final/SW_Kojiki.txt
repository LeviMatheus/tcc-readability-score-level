"Kojiki" or "Furukotofumi" (古事記), also called in English as the "Records of Ancient Matters", is the oldest book known in Japan. The body of the "Kojiki" is written in Chinese, but it includes many Japanese names and some phrases. The songs included in the "Kojiki" are in ancient Japanese written phonetically with Chinese characters. The Kojiki is a text which tells about the creation of the Kami (deities), their brothers and sisters, and the Earth.
A document that is said to be an older work, the "Kujiki" (the "Kojiki" was written around the year 620 AD), also exists, but most experts believe it to be false.
