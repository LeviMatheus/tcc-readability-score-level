Backgammon is a game played by two players. Each player moves pieces around a board from one side to another. Players roll two dice to find out how far their pieces can move in one turn. The winner is the first to get all of his or her pieces all the way around the board.
Usual playing time is around 15- 30 minutes, per game. The roll of two dice introduces a random component in the game, but Backgammon is basically a game of strategy.
The game has a long history. Games that resemble it very much have been played since antiquity. Archaeologists doing excavations at a place called "Burnt City" in modern-day Iran have found parts of a game that resembled backgammon. They have found 60 pieces to play with, and two dice. They could show that the game utensils date from around 3000 BC. These pieces around 100-200 years older than another set, found in Ur, in Mesopotamia.
