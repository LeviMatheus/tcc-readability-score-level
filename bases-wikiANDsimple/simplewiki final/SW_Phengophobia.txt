Phengophobia is an abnormal fear of daylight. It is a rare but serious problem. People who have a fear of something are said to have a phobia. The word comes from two Greek words; "phengos" meaning daylight, and "phobos" meaning fear.
Sometimes people with the disease get discriminated against and are sometimes called vampires. There is presently no cure for this phobia, but there are ways to suppress it effects.
