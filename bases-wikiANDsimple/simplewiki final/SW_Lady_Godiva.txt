Godiva (; about 980 â€“ 1067) was an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman. There are legends that say that she rode naked through the streets of Coventry in England. She did this so her husband would lower the taxes on his tenants. The name "Peeping Tom" for a voyeur comes from later versions of this legend. In these versions, man named Tom had watched her ride and was struck blind or dead.
