Resuscitation is a kind of thing to do in a medical emergency. It is first aid which is given to a person that is unconscious, and where breathing or pulse can not be detected. It is done to make oxygen continue to reach the heart and the brain. That way, a doctor may be able to restart the heart, possibly without damaging the brain.
The most common cause for a stopping heart is a heart attack.
