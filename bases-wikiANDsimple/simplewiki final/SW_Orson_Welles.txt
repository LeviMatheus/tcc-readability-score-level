George Orson Welles (May 6, 1915 â€“ October 10, 1985) was an American director of movies and the theatre, as well as an actor, screenwriter, broadcaster and producer.
In 1938, he performed "The War of the Worlds" (about an attack on Earth by beings from the planet Mars) on the radio. The radio play Welles performed was fiction, but many people believed it was non-fiction (or a newscast).
He also made the movie Citizen Kane in 1941. Many movie critics think that this film is the best movie ever made.
