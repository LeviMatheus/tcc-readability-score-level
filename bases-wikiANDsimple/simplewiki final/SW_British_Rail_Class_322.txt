The British Rail Class 322 electric multiple units were built by BREL between 1988-90. Five 4-car units were built for the dedicated Stansted Express service from London Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport. The units are now operated by First ScotRail, between Edinburgh Waverley and North Berwick.
