A kilometre is a measurement that is equivalent to 1000 metres, and 100000 centimetres. And since a "cube" is a shape formed by having the same length, breadth and height, a cubic kilometre refers to a unit of volume, that is 1km3. In other words, it is a cube with a length of one kilometre, with 1,000,000 litres of space.
