Margaret "Maggie" Simpson is a fictional character shown in the animated television series "The Simpsons". She is a baby.
Character.
Like most babies, Maggie copies what she sees around her. She once hit Homer on the head with a mallet, shot a suction dart at his picture and attacked him with a pencil in imitation of "Itchy and Scratchy". Maggie is also very accurate with a gun, she shot Mr.Burns in the two parter Who Shot Mr. Burns.
Characteristics.
During the early episodes of the show, Maggie's most well-known feature would be to trip over her clothes and fall on her face while trying to walk, causing a loud smack on the floor. Throughout the Tracey Ullman shorts, Maggie fell down 39 times.
Creation.
Maggie was named after Matt Groening's younger sister Margaret "Maggie" Groening. She often sucked on a pacifier and wore a sleep suit like Maggie. Groening thought that it would be funny to have a baby character that did not talk and never grew up, but showed any emotions that the scene needed.
Voice.
With few exceptions, Maggie never speaks but is aware of what is going around her. Maggie has spoken in "Good Night", the first cartoon to air on "The Tracey Ullman Show". When the rest of the family falls asleep, she speaks and her voice is played by Liz Georges.
Maggie's first word spoken in the normal television show of the series happened in "Lisa's First Word", when she was voiced by Elizabeth Taylor and says "Daddy" in an empty room. Elizabeth Taylor as Maggie was later named the 13th greatest guest spot in the history of the show. James Earl Jones, who voiced Maggie in Treehouse of Horror V, was in seventh place. She would later have small sentences in Treehouse of Horror IX, voiced by Harry Shearer, who used his Kang voice. Her squeaks and occasional speaking parts are regularly done by Nancy Cartwright or Yeardley Smith.
