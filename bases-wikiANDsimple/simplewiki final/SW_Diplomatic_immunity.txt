Diplomatic immunity means that the laws of a host country do not apply to people who work in the embassies and consulates of another country. These officials are called diplomats.
This was to allow them to do their jobs without interference from the police and government of the host country. It also allows a country to keep its secrets from the host country.
Police cannot arrest or search diplomats their houses or offices, or even give their cars parking tickets without the permission of the foreign government.
Honorary consuls only work part-time as diplomats, so only have diplomatic immunity when working as diplomats. Police may search their offices, but not the part where they keep their diplomatic work.
