Skene's glands (also called lesser vestibular glands or paraurethral glands) are glands in the upper wall of the vagina. They empty into the urethra. Their location is known as the Gr√§fenberg spot. In males, their homologue is the prostate gland.
The glands are named after the person who described them first, Alexander Skene. He was a physician.
