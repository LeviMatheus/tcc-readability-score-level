"König von Deutschland", in English "King of Germany", is a song by Rio Reiser. It was written in 1975 while Rio was a member of Ton Steine Scherben. The song was only recorded 1986 on the album "Rio I.", however it was heard at Ton Steine Scheiben concerts since at least 1976. Rio Reiser himself is sometimes nicknamed 'King of Germany' because of this song.
The song was later published again with a modified song text. "König von Deutschland (Best of)" is also the name of his best-of album of 1994.
A number of cover versions of the song exist, among them songs from Bela B. (Die Ärzte), and Wizo.
Song text.
Today the song text is part of the traditional culture of Germany. It does not matter whether the song text is modified - in fact one can find an intention for modification so that the song text does better match with a current political situation. (Ton Steine Scherben was punk band with radical political songs - after its dissolution (i.e. break-up) Rio made a number of sarcastic (i.e. biting-funny) pop songs that made fun of the situation).
