Onions are vegetables. They are plants in the genus "Allium". When people talk about onions, they usually mean "garden onions". Onions have bulbs, which are edible, in most species. They have a strong flavour, and a very distinctive smell.
Onions have been grown for a very long time. Together with leek and garlic, they go back to Ancient Egypt at least.
How onions are eaten.
Onions can be eaten in different ways. Fried onions are often served with hot dogs. Pickled onions are eaten with chips or with salad. Raw onions are sliced (cut into flat layers) for Hamburgers. Chopped onions are put in many stews and curries. Onions are sometimes roasted whole.
