Warp Technology is fictional technology created within science fiction. It is a way of moving objects faster than the speed of light. There are many examples of how this idea is used. A well known one is found in the Star Trek universe where faster-than-light travel is needed to tell the story.
Current technology does not allow anything or anyone to go, at, or faster than the speed of light. Unless the current theories are proven wrong, this will always be true. However warp technology as a fictional idea has proven to be an interesting way of shaping the story line to let spaceships move at speeds greater than 186,000 miles per second (speed of light through a vacuum - the known limit of speed in the universe).
Warp technology allows ships move at warp speed. In the Star Trek universe for example the actual speed the ship is moving is called the warp factor(although thrusters and impluse power propel spaceships at sub-light speed). Warp speed ranges from warp factor 1 (the speed of light) up to warp factor 9.99. In some circumstances Star Trek spaceships can go faster than warp 10 although rare.
