History.
In Roman times Leeds was called 'Leodis' which means 'People of the flowing river'.
Leeds grew into a large city, mainly during Victorian times, many factories were built in the city, producing cloth as well as other products. Most of these factories have now closed.
With the building of many of the factories and mills in Leeds, many canals and railways were built in the city as well.
Leeds used to have a tram system but this was removed in 1959. There has been plans to bring it back. Trolley buses have also been considered.
Marks and Spencers started with a market stall in Leeds Market, Marks and Spencers now have shops throughout the city with their largest one being on Briggate.
Much of Leeds was rebuilt in the 1960s and 1970s as the old Victorian buildings were mostly run down and unsuitable for modern use. Many new council houses and flats were built around the city.
In the 1970s the council used the moto 'Motorway City of the 1970s' to try promote the city. This is because the Leeds Inner Ring Road is a motorway.
