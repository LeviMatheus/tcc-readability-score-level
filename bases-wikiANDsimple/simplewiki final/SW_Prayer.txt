Prayer is attempting to talk to God or a supernatural being. It is an important part of many religions. There is no conclusive evidence, but many believe their prayers are answered. Prayer is done by those who trust the power of word and thought. Many religions recognise the creation of the universe by God from words. Jesus taught people to say the Lord's Prayer.
