James Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx, KG, OBE, FRS, PC (March 11 1916 – May 24 1995) was one of the most prominent British politicians of the 20th century. He won more elections than any other 20th century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (in 1964, 1966, February and October 1974) — but only once with a clear majority (1966).
