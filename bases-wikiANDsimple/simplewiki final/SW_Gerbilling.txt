Monowheel.
Gerbilling is when the rider of a monowheel brakes too hard. Instead of staying in the normal position at the bottom of the wheel they spin around the inside uncontrollably. This sense is derived from gerbil wheels.
As a sexual term.
Gerbilling, also known as gerbil stuffing or gerbil shooting is the sexual practice of inserting small animals, usually gerbils but also hamsters, and reportedly other rodents, into the rectum; the idea being that the animals would snoop and or wiggle about which in turn would stimulate the prostate as in anal sex. Although there are apparently widespread public belief and persistent rumours about this, especially in the 1980s, no medical evidence of gerbilling exists; this would classify it as an urban legend.
