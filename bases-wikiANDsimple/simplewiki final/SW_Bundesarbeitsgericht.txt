The Bundesarbeitsgericht or "Federal Labour Court" is the German federal supreme court of appeals for cases of labour law. This includes "individual" labour law (mostly about contracts of employment) and "collective" (more than one) labour law (e.g. cases about strikes and collective bargaining). The court hears cases from the "Landesarbeitsgerichte" (Superior State Labour Courts), which, in turn, are the courts of appeals against decisions of the "Arbeitsgerichte" (ordinary State Labour Courts).
The "Bundesarbeitsgericht" is in the city of Erfurt.
