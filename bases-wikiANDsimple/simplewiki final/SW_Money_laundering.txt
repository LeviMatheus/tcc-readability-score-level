Money laundering is something some criminals do to the money they make from crime. When a criminal does money laundering, the criminal tries to make it hard for the police to find out where the criminal got the money.
One way criminals do money laundering is by using the money to buy things (like gold and silver, shares or casino chips) and then selling those things to get the money back. If a criminal buys and sells things many times it is hard for the police to find out where the criminal got the money.
In 1989, some countries set up a group of people from different Governments to tell countries the best ways to stop money laundering. This organization is called the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.
