Worcestershire sauce (wooster-sheer) is a widely used fermented sauce. It was first made at 68 Broad Street, Worcester by Messrs Lea & Perrins in the 1830s. It was made commercially in 1837, and remains the only Worcestershire Sauce still to be made in the UK. In 1930 the business was sold to HP Foods and was later acquired by the H.J. Heinz Company when they acquired that business from Groupe Danone in 2005.
The product is made and bottled in the Midlands Road factory in Worcester, which has been the home of Lea & Perrins since 16th October 1897.
The H. J. Heinz Company, which now manufactures "The Original Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce", under the name Lea & Perrins, Inc., lists the following ingredients on the label of a bottle produced in the United States: vinegar, molasses, high fructose corn syrup, anchovies, water, onions, salt, garlic, tamarind] concentrate, cloves, natural flavorings and chili pepper extract.
The ingredients of a bottle of Worcestershire Sauce from England sold under the name "The Original & Genuine Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce" by Lea & Perrins, Limited, lists the following ingredients: malt vinegar (from barley), spirit vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, tamarind extract, onions, garlic, spice and flavouring.
The sauce is used in many dishes, both cooked and uncooked, and particularly with beef; drinks such as the Bloody Mary also contain it. Lea & Perrins supplies it in concentrate form to be bottled abroad.
Worcestershire sauce is referred to in South Africa and some parts of the US as Worcester sauce (), or spelled phonetically as Wooster sauce.
A fermented fish sauce called "garum" was a staple of Greco-Roman cuisine and of the Mediterranean economy of the Roman Empire. "Worcestershire sauce" is one of the many legacies of British contact with India, though. While some sources trace comparable fermented anchovy sauces in Europe to the 17th century, this one became popular in the 1840s.
