"Asterix" () is a French comic book, created by Ren√© Goscinny (words) and Albert Uderzo (pictures). Goscinny died in 1977 and Uderzo continues to draw and write the series by himself. The title character Asterix is a Gaul, a member of Celtic tribe that lived in France, many years ago. Asterix lives in a small village in northwest Gaul (Anicent France) during the time of Julius Caesar in 50 BC. Unlike, the rest of Gaul, this village has not been taken over by the Romans, because the people in the village drink a magic potion brewed by their druid. Asterix has many adventures with his friend, Obelix. The stories have been adapted into movies and video games, there is even an amusement park.
