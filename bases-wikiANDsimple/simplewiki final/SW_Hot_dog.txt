A hot dog (or hotdog) is a type of food. It consists of a sausage (Frankfurter or Wiener), which is usually boiled, grilled, fried, or barbequed. This sausage is usually served in a bun or another type of bread. The most common type of hot dogs are made from beef and beef by-products, often in combination with pork and pork by-products. Chicken and vegetarian hot dogs are popular as well. Animal by-products are used in all but vegetarian hot dogs, and may include skin (rind), lips, pig snouts, rectums, connective tissue, gristle, intestines, fat, and other parts of animal bodies. Bone marrow and brain matter may also be included. Hot dogs and other sausage products were initially developed as a way to sell these meat byproducts that otherwise had little market value. Approximately 20% by weight of hot dogs is usually non-meat ingredients including water, sugar, and spices. Some legal categories of hot dogs, such as "frankfurters" can contain up to 3.5% of non-meat fillers as well, such as corn meal.
To enhance the taste, various toppings and sauces are often added. The most common sauces in the United States are ketchup, mustard and pickle relish. Onions, chopped pickles, hot sauce and cheese are also sometimes added to the food. Onions cooked in tomato sauce and Sauerkraut are popular toppings, as is chili.
A type of hot dog called a "kosher hot dog" is very common in parts of the United States. It is similar to most hot dogs except that it is always made of beef, is saltier, often has spices added to it and is processed under rabbinical supervision.
