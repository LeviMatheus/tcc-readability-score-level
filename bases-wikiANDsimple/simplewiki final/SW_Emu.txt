The Emu is a large bird, one of the rare birds that cannot fly. It is usually found in mainland Australia. It is the tallest bird from Australia. It is also the second tallest bird in the world, after its ratite relative, the ostrich. It is also related to the cassowary which is slightly smaller but heavier. The soft-feathered, brown, birds reach up to 2 m (6.5 ft) in height. The Emu is common over most of mainland Australia. It avoids very thick forests and very dry areas. Emus can travel great distances at a fast trot. If necessary they can run at up to 50 h (30Â mph) for some distance at a time. They may travel long distances to find food. They feed on a variety of plants and insects.
There was a slightly different Emu species that lived in Tasmania. They became extinct after the European settlement started in 1803. On the mainland of Australia emus were once common on the east coast but have become uncommon with increased human population. On the other hand the development of farms and the supply of water for stock have increased the range of the Emu in arid (dry) regions. Emus are farmed for their meat, oil and leather.
The history of the name.
The first written description of the emu was under the name of the New Holland Cassowary in Arthur Phillip's "Voyage to Botany Bay", published in 1789. The species was named by ornithologist (bird expert) John Latham, who worked on Phillip's book. He provided the first descriptions of and names for many Australian bird species. Its scientific name, Dromaius novaehollandiae, is from the Latin words, meaning "fast-footed New Hollander". The history of the common name, "Emu", is not certain, but is thought to have come from an Arabic word for large bird. This word was later used by Portuguese explorers to describe the related Cassowary in New Guinea. In Victoria, some Indigenous Australian words for the emu were "Barrimal" in the Djadja wurrung language, "myoure" in Gunai, and "courn" in Jardwadjali.
