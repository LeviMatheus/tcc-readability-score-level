A man is a male human adult (male:not female; human:a person; adult:not a child). We use the word "man" (one "man", two or more "men") to talk about biological sex.
Manhood is the time in a man's life after he changes from a boy. A boy is a male human child, not a female child (a girl).
After boys grow, we call them a man. There are some times we also call a man a "boy". For example, we often use the word "boy" when talking about adult males who have a partner, for example in the word boyfriend. Sometimes people also use the word in a bad way for a black man or male slave.
Sex.
There are some sexual differences between a man and a woman. Men have sex organs which we call "external" (not in the body). But many parts of the male reproductive system are internal too. The study of male reproduction and sex organs is "andrology".
Men normally have the same illnesses as women, but there are some sexual illnesses which men have only, or more often.
Biology is not the only thing which makes people feel they are men, or that other people are men. Perhaps one in 100,000 people are men who were born without a male body. We call these "transgendered" or "transsexual" men. Some men can have a hormone or chromosomal difference (for example "androgen insensitivity syndrome"). Some men have other intersex conditions. Some of those intersex people who people said were female (girls) when they were born later want to change this.
About 20% of males, especially babies and children in the USA, have had circumcision which changes the male genitalia (the penis).
There are more differences between men and women, not only sexual differences.
