Warm-blooded animals are animals who can control the temperature of their body. When they are cold they "shiver", or shake, to make them warmer. When they are warm they "sweat", make water from the body, to become cooler. This is different from cold-blooded animals who need to move to warm places to become warm and move to cold places to be cold. Warm-blooded animals do not need to move to make them warm or cold.
