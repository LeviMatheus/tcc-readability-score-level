198 Ampella is a fairly big Main belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Alphonse Borrelly on June 13, 1879. The name seems to be the feminine form of Ampelos, a satyr and good friend of Dionysus in Greek mythology. It could also come from the Ampelose (plural of Ampelos), a variety of hamadryad.
So far Ampella has been seen occulting a star once, on November 8, 1991 from New South Wales, Australia.
