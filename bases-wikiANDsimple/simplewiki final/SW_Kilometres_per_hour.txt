Kilometres per hour is a unit of measurement, which measures speed or velocity. The unit symbol is km/h or km·h−1. By definition, an object travelling at a speed of 1 km/h in a straight line for 1 hour moves 1 kilometre. The unit is the most commonly used unit of speed worldwide, more common than the SI unit of speed, metres per second.
