A virtual private network or VPN for short, is a way of connecting two computers through a network. Most people using computers connect to the World Wide Web using a normal network - they use dial-up or broadband. VPN is a little bit different, it is used by some workers to connect using a laptop to do work - they can check their work email and see work websites which can't be seen on the normal internet.
