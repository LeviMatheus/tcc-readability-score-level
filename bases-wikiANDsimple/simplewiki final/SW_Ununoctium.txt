Ununoctium (or), also known as eka-radon or element 118, is the temporary IUPAC name for the transactinide element having the atomic number 118 and temporary element symbol Uuo. An ununoctium atom is very unstable, meaning it quickly changes to another atom (nuclear reaction). Only three atoms of ununoctium have been found since 2002. Although it is a noble gas, it is more reactive than other noble gases.
