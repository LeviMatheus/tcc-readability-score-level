A peanut is a type of nut. It is a legume in the family Fabaceae. This family is native to South America. It is an annual plant which grows between 30cm and 50cm high.
While it is called "nut" by many, the fruit of this plant is not really a nut, but a legume.
Peanuts have been cultivated in South America for a very long time. Today most peanuts are eaten roasted and salted. Peanut butter peanut brittle and candy bars are also often eaten.
The U.S. introduced the peanut to the tropical South America, and India, China, West Africa, and itself to become the largest commercial producers of peanuts. The peanut was grown mainly for its edible oil, except in the U.S., where it was produced for grinding into peanut butter, for roasted, salted nuts; and for use in candy and bakery products. A small percentage of the U.S. crop is crushed for oil. In the southern U.S. the peanut is used extensively as feed for livestock.
