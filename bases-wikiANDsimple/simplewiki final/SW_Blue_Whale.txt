The Blue Whale ("Balaenoptera musculus") is a baleen whale, of the biological order Cetacea.
They can grow to be about 25 meters (80 feet) long, and the biggest Blue Whale found was 29 meters (94 feet) long. This makes blue whales the largest animals ever to be on Earth, even bigger than the largest dinosaurs. They eat tiny living things, like krill and plankton.
