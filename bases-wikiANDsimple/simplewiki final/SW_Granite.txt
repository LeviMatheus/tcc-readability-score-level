Granite is a kind of igneous rock, which means that it came from volcanic action inside the Earth. Granite is made from magma. Magma is molten (very hot, melted) rock and minerals. The magma is forced between other layers of rock by the pressure under the Earth's surface. The magma cools and turns slowly into solid stone. Granite has many different types of minerals in it. These include quartz, feldspar, mica, and hornblende. As the magma cools, some of these minerals form crystals. The crystals can often be seen easily, if the granite is cut and polished.
Granite is a common stone on Earth, and makes up a big part of the crust (the Earth's outer layer). Although it forms under the surface of the Earth, there are many places where it has been forced upwards by tectonic movement. This is the cracking and folding of the Earth's crust. When this happens, granite mountains are often formed.
Granite is a very useful rock for building. It is good for making solid walls. It is also good for polishing, because it can have a shiny surface which shows the pattern of its crystals. Kitchen benches are often made of polished granite. Granite is found in many countries of the world. Some countries have beautifully patterned granite which is quarried (cut in open mines) and sold for building material.
