Krypton is a noble gas. That means that it does not react with other elements to form compounds. It is not used for many things, and there is not much of it in the air. It is clear and does not taste like anything, so we do not really see it. That made it hard for chemists to find.
Krypton is number 36 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Kr.
It was found by Sir William Ramsay and Morris Travers in Great Britain in 1898.
