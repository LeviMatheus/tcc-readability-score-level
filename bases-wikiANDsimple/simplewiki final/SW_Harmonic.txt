Harmonics is a short term for harmonics of a wave motion, or wave motion harmonics. Harmonics are waves added to a fundamental wave (of any radiant energy, for example sound or electricity), having a frequency that is a whole multiple (an integer) of the fundamental frequency. The second harmonic has a frequency twice that of the fundamental, the third harmonic three times, and so on. Frequencies that lie between one harmonic and another harmonic are called interharmonics.
