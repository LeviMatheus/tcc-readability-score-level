100 Hekate is a big Main belt asteroid. It orbits in the same area of space as the Hygiea asteroid family, however it is actually an unrelated interloper. Its albedo of 0.19 is too high, and it is of the wrong spectral class to be part of the dark carbonaceous Hygiea family.
Hekate was the 100th asteroid to be found, by J. C. Watson on July 11, 1868. It is named after Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft in Greek mythology, but its name also honours it as the hundredth asteroid, as "hekaton" is Greek for 'hundred'.
A Hekatean occultation of a star was seen on July 14, 2003 from New Zealand.
