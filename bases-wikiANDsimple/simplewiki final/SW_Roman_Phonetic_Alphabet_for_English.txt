The Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English is a system based on the Extended Basic Roman spelling of English, augmented with two pairs of stress marks in order to disambiguate words that share the same spelling but have different meanings, and ensure a one-to-one phoneme-grapheme correspondence. The system has certain similarities to the systems of the NBC Handbook of Pronunciation, the Carnegie Mellon version of Arpabet alphabet, and the World Book Dictionary.
