The River Yare is a river in the county of Norfolk, England.
The river starts south of Dereham in the county of Norfolk. From there it flows to the east. The river flows along the southern edge of the city of Norwich. The river continues past Norwich into the tidal lake of Breydon Water. Here the Yare is joined by the Rivers Bure and Waveney. It empties into North Sea at Gorleston, Great Yarmouth.
Small coastal boats can sail along the river from Norwich to the North Sea. In the past, the river had a large amount of boats carrying good to Norwich. Larger modern boats can not get across Breydon Water because it is not deep enough. Because of this, a canal was created at Reedham to provides a connection to the River Waveney.
