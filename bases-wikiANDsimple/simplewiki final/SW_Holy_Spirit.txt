The Holy Spirit is a part of what is known as the Holy Trinity in the Christian belief. The Trinity includes God the Father, God the Son (Jesus) and God the Holy Spirit. When Jesus came to Earth, he said that it was better for him to leave so that he could leave with us the Holy Spirit as a teacher. It is often believed that the Holy Spirit is the still small voice inside that help us determine right from wrong. It is said that Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit so it would make sense then that he would be what Jesus left on Earth after his death.
In the Assembles of God Sect of Christianity, it is believed that speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Spirit and is the first initial evidence of the action; this is not an adopted belief in all of Christianity.
