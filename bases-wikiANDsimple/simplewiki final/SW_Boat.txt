A boat is a vehicle used to travel on water. It is smaller than a ship. Some boats have sails, some are powered by rowing with oars, and some use motors.
These boats are usually made of wood. However, some parts are made of metals like steel and aluminium. Expensive boats may have parts from fiberglass or composite materials.
