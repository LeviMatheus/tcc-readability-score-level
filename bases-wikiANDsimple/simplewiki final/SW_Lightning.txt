Lightning is a powerful electrical discharge produced during a thunderstorm. The electric current is very hot and causes the air around it to expand very quickly, which in turn makes thunder. Sometimes it happens between clouds. Sometimes (in the rain) it goes from cloud to ground. If it goes from cloud to ground, it can strike a person. Around 2000 people are struck by lightning each year.
Benjamin Franklin was fascinated by lightning and its properties. His curiosity led to many important discoveries.
Lightning is caused by static charges mainly positive and negative opposite charges coming and repelling each other.
