719 Albert is an Amor asteroid, the second one found after 433 Eros. It is also a Mars-crosser asteroid.
It was found by Johann Palisa in 1911, but then was lost and not found again until 2000, using data from the Spacewatch asteroid survey project. When the asteroid was found again, it was designated 2000 JW8. By 2000, Albert was the last "lost" asteroid among the numbered asteroids (69230 Hermes was not numbered until 2003). The second last "lost" numbered asteroid, 878 Mildred, had been found again in 1991.
Palisa named the asteroid in memory of a major benefactor, Albert Salomon von Rothschild, who had died some months before.
