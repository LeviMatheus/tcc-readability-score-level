Jock Sturges (born 1947) is an American photographer. He is most well known for taking photographs of young people, often in the nude. His work on the nude beaches in France and California has been the subject of disputes.
Sturges was born in New York City. He got his degree in photography at Marlboro College. Sturges caused dispute, as his work is mostly young girls and boys photographed in the nude. In April 1990, he was raided and arrested by the FBI, but the case was thrown out by the Grand Jury, because his photographs were of naturism rather than pornography.
