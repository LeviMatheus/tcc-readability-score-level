The Nintendo Virtual Boy was a mostly-portable game console which had two screens that showed only red and black graphics. To use the system, one had to put one's face close to the system so that each eye could see only one screen. By showing each eye a different image, the system could create a 3D effect.
The Virtual Boy was first sold in 1995, but was not popular. Consumers did not like the console's high price, monochrome graphics, and need for a stand. Many were saving money for the soon-to-be-sold Nintendo 64. Nintendo lowered the price many times, but the system did not sell well and was discontinued (Nintendo stopped making them) in 1996. Only 22 games were released in Japan and America.
Popular games for the system include Mario Tennis and a Wario Land.
The Virtual Boy was made by Gunpei Yokoi, who also made the Game Boy and Game & Watch.
