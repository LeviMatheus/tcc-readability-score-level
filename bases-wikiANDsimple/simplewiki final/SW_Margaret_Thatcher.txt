Margaret Hilda Thatcher, "Baroness Thatcher LG, OM, PC, FRS " (born Margaret Hilda Roberts October 13, 1925) was the first woman Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990. Leader of the Conservative Party, she is often remembered by her nickname, "the Iron Lady". She also directed British troops in 1982 to recapture the Falkland Islands from Argentina, which had captured them for a short time, in the Falklands War. Also, she had the second longest single term in history. She also married Sir Dennis Thatcher.
She suffered from very strong opposition during the miner`s strike and also when she attempted to introduce a poll tax into Britain. This caused widespread rioting across the country. This is one of the reasons why she was replaced in 1990 by John Major.
