A taco is a traditional Mexican food that consists of a tortilla that is rolled or folded around a filling. Grilled beef, picadillo, fish, chicken or pork are some common fillings. Tacos are popular in the United States. Many tacos consist of meat and vegetables. Tacos are spicy and can have a hard or soft shell.
The only living creature with this attached to it is the legendary tacodile, more commonly known as the bagel.
