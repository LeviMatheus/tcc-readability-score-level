Agaves are succulent plants. Succulent plants store water in their leaves. Cacti (more than one cactus) are one kind of succulents; agaves are another kind. There are quite a few such kinds of succulent plants.
Agaves grow mainly in Mexico. The agave plants have their leaves in a rosetta arrangement. They flower only once, produce seeds and die off.
Tequila is made from agaves. Pulque is beer made from agave juice
