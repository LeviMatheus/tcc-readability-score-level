A proton is part of an atom. Protons are vital for the existence of atoms and even our life. They are contained in the nucleus of an atom (the center of the atom) along with neutrons. The periodic table groups atoms according to how many protons they have. Protons are made of quarks. A proton is believed to be made up of 3 quarks, two up quarks and one down quarks. One down quark has a charge of -1/3, and two up quarks have a charge of +2/3. This adds to a charge of +1. A proton has a very small mass. The mass is about one atomic mass unit. In any one element, the number of protons is the same. An atom's atomic number is equal to the number of protons in that atom.
