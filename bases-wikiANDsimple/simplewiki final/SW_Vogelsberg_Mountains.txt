The Vogelsberg Mountains are a group of low mountains in central Germany, located in the middle of the state of Hessen. They are the product of ancient volcanic activity and are separated from the Rh√∂n Mountains by the Fulda River and its valley.
The Vogelsberg is about 19 million years old and is Germany's only shield volcano and the largest basalt formation of Central Europe. It consists of many layers which fall downward from their peak in ring-shaped terraces to the base.
The highest mountains of the Vogelsberg are Taufstein, 773 m (2,536 ft), and Hoherodskopf, 763 m (2,503 ft), both are now in a national park, the Hoher Vogelsberg Nature Reserve.
