A television programme (American spelling: program) is something that people watch on television.
Television broadcasting is a lot of different television programmes which are shown one after another. In between television programmes, a channel may use an announcer to tell the audience what the next programme will be. On many channels in many countries in the world, advertisments are shown for short periods of time during and between programme screenings. These advertisements are not a part of the television programme.
