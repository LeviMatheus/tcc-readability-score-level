William Randolph Hearst (April 29, 1863 â€“ August 14, 1951) was an American newspaper magnate, born in San Francisco, California.
William Randolph was the only child of George Hearst, a successful miner who became a multi-millionaire, and later U.S. Senator from California, and Phoebe Apperson Hearst, a former school teacher from Missouri.
Hearst was a media tycoon. He started a newspaper empire, now the Hearst corporation. He has become known for sensationalist stories. Those stories were often false, or only very loosely based on true events.
The film Citizen Kane by Orson Welles tells the story about William Randolph Hearst.
A modern-day equivalent of Hearst would probably be Silvio Berlusconi.
