A disability is an aspect of a person that limits them in some way.
People with disabilities try to live just like other people do. They sometimes need special equipment (such
s or special cups to drink from) or "accessible" buildings (with ramps, elevators, wide doorways and plenty of room beside the toilet, for example).
