The World Trade Center (WTC) in New York City had several buildings.
These buildings were designed by Minoru Yamasaki with Antonio Brittiochi. Minoru Yamasaki was an American architect.
The World Trade Center was most famous for its Twin Towers. These two skyscrapers, the North Tower and the South Tower, were once the tallest buildings in the world. They had 110 floors each. The Twin Towers and the WTC building 7 were destroyed in the September 11, 2001 attacks while the other buildings were damaged beyond repair. Currently, the site is being developed as a memorial ground to the victims of the attacks, with a new Freedom Tower set to be built in its place.
