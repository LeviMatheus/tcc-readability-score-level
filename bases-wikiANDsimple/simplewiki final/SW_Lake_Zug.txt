The Lake Zug (German: "Zugersee") is one of the lesser known Swiss lakes, on the outskirts of the Alps and north of Lake Lucerne. It is fed by the Aa, which descends from the Rigi and enters the south end of the lake. The Lorze feeds the lake at the northern shore.
For the most part, the lake is in the Canton of Zug, but the southern end is up to 10km in the canton of Schwyz, while the Canton of Lucerne stretches over a 2km area by the Immensee.
At its northern end the shores are nearly level, while on the west shore the wooded promontory of Buonas (with its castles, old and new) projects picturesquely into the waters. The principal place on the lake is the town of Zug. Three railways follow the shore of the lake, one from Zürich via Zug and Arth-Goldau to the St Gotthard, one from Lucerne via Arth-Goldau to the St Gotthard and one from Zürich via Zug to Lucerne.
Many fish (including pike and carp of considerable weights) are taken from the lake, which is especially famous for an endemic kind of trout ("Salmo salvelinus", locally called "Rolheli"). Because of farming runoff, it is not one of Switzerland's cleanest lakes.
Historical notes.
In 1911, a railway was built around the lake.
The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1852.
