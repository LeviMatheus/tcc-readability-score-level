Kingman Reef is a coral reef in the North Pacific Ocean, owned by the United States. It is owned directly by the federal government. There is no local government.
It is the farthest north of the Northern Line Islands. It is only sometimes above water, and it is uninhabited (no one lives there).
Palmyra Atoll is the other U.S. territory in the Northern Line Islands.
