The West Bank is a piece of land in the Middle East. It touches the Dead Sea and the River Jordan, and the landscape is pretty dry.
Right now, it is under the control of nearby Israel, some countries and the United Nations say. But some Israelis and other groups (Especially other Muslim groups and nations) disagree on whose it really is.
Right now, talks between the Israeli government, and the Palestinian National Authority, which leads Palestine, are happening. These talks are about what will happen in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in the future.
