A ghost town is a name for a city in which no one lives anymore. It can happen because of economical reasons (for instance, a town of gold miners who cannot find any more gold), a natural disaster (a flood, or a very long drought) or even a man- made disaster (for example, the nuclear fallout that emptied the town of Prypiat, Ukraine). Some ghost towns are kept intact as tourist attractions.
