The mind is the part of a person that thinks, reasons, perceives, wills, and feels. Certain religions say that the mind is separate from the body and is called a Soul (see Dualism). Others believe that the mind is just a different way of describing certain parts of the human brain.
Sciences that focus on the mind include philosophy of the mind, psychology and neuroscience.
Artificial intelligence is an attempt to create a machine that works like a human brain.
