Baruch Spinoza (November 24, 1632 – February 21, 1677) was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Jewish origin. He is considered to be one of the great Rationalist philosophers of the 17th century. Other famous rationalists include Gottfried Leibniz and René Descartes.
Life.
Spinoza's ideas were disliked by the Jewish community of the time, and Spinoza was excommunicated in 1656.
Key ideas.
An important idea in Spinoza's philosophy is that God and Nature (everything that exists) are the same thing. Opposing Dualism, Spinoza said that the body and the mind (soul) are two of God's infinite attributes.
There is no good or evil in Nature, and that these words only have meanings for human beings. For a person, an event that leads to happiness is good, and an event that leads to suffering is bad.
The goal of every person is to intellectually love God (that is, understand Nature as much as humanly possible).
