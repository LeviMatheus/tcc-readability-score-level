Reading is a way of getting information from something that is written. Reading involves recognising the symbols that make up a language. Reading and hearing are the two most common ways to get information. Information gained from reading can include entertainment, especially when reading fiction or humor.
Reading by people is mostly done from paper. Stone, or chalk on a blackboard can also be read. Computer displays can be read.
Reading can be something that someone does by themself or they can read aloud. This could be to benefit other listeners. It could also be to help your own concentration.
"Proofreading" is a kind of reading that is done to find mistakes in a piece of writing.
