Cutlery are tools used for preparing, serving and eating food. The most common types of cutlery are knives, spoons and forks.
The best quality cutlery is often made of silver, though steel is often used. In a restaurant, they are often served wrapped in a cloth napkin (serviette). Plastic cutlery is used for eating fast food, because it can be thrown away.
In the United States, these are more often called "utensils". They are also often called "silverware", even when they are not made of silver.
