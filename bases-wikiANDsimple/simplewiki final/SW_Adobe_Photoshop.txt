Photoshop is a popular image editing software package. It is widely used by photographers for editing photographs (fix colors, reduce noise, add effects, fix brightness/contrast) and by graphic designers and Web designers to create and edit images for web pages.
Photoshop works on computer systems like Windows and Mac. The software is made by the company Adobe. There is also a version named Photoshop Elements, made for the home user that does not want to buy the full version that is more expensive.
The current version is Photoshop CS4, which was released in 2008.
