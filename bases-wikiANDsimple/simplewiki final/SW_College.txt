College is a kind of school, a place where people go to learn skills for future jobs. Most people go to college right after high school but other people choose to go later in life.
College is a career choice that most people make because it will help them to earn more money and live better lives.
In some countries, for example the United Kingdom, college means also a house belonging to a university, where students and teachers live together.
