Portlethen is a town situated seven miles south of Aberdeen, Scotland along the A90. It has expanded rapidly over the last thirty years. Portlethen has a population of about seven thousand, and more than eight hundred houses are as of 2007 being built on nearby farmland. To the east of Portlethen lie three fishing villages: Findon, Downies and Old Portlethen (now often referred to as "Portlethen Village"). Although Portlethen is a town in terms of population (and it has been granted official town status); it resembles a residential suburb without a clear 'town centre' or focal point.
