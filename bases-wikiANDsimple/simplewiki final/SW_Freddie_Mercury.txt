Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara September 5 1946 - November 24 1991) was the lead singer for English rock band Queen.
Mercury was born in Stone Town in Zanzibar in Africa. His parents were Jer and Romi Bulsara. They were both Persian. His father worked as a High Court cashier in the government. Mercury also had a younger sister named Kashmira. She was born in 1952. His friends at school gave him the name "Freddie." His family then began calling him Freddie too.
At the young age of eight, Mercury was sent to a boarding school in India. The school, St. Peters English Boarding school, was around 50 miles outside of the city of Bombay (now called Mumbai). He grew up to be an amazing artist, and sportsman. At the age of ten he was named the school champion of Table Tennis. At the age of twelve he received a trophy called the Junior All-rounder.
Mercury was more interested in music than anything else. He listened to anything he could find. He soon got the schooling he needed to be able to help his music career. He joined a choir and started learning how to play the piano. Like any young school-bound music prodigy, he liked music much more than his school work. He had a 3.5 octave vocal range. That is very large for anyone, but especially large for a man.
Mercury moved to London for his musical career. While in London, he became very fond of a woman named Mary Austin. Although they never had a relationship together, they lived together before and after the band Queen took off and moved to a house in London nicknamed "The Court of King Freddie". Mary still lives in that house and allows fans to visit the house on the day of Freddie's death each year.
Mercury was in love with a local barber when he died. They were happy in a loving relationship of 6 years when it was learned by the media that Mercury had AIDS. Two days after the news was found out, Freddie passed away. He died of health problems caused by AIDS on November 24, 1991.
