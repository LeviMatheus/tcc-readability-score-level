Jean-Antoine Watteau (October 10, 1684 – July 18, 1721) was a French painter whose brief career spurred the revival of interest in colour and movement (in the tradition of Correggio and Rubens), and brought back the almost forgotten Baroque idiom, which, in time became known as Rococo. He is credited with inventing the genre of "fêtes galantes": scenes of bucolic and idyllic charm, along with an air of theatricality. Some of his best known subjects were drawn from the world of Italian comedy and ballet.
