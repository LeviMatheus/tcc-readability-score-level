A disease or medical condition is an abnormality of the body or mind that causes discomfort, dysfunction, distress, or death to the person afflicted or those in contact with the person. The term is sometimes used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts these may be considered separate categories. Literally, a disease refers to the invasion of the body by pathogens.
Causes of disease.
A disease can be caused by many things. A person can be infected by infectious agents like bacteria or viruses. Disease can also be caused by eating spoiled foods. There are small germs in spoiled foods that can cause diseases. Some people are born with 'genetic diseases.' These are diseases because of an error or mutation in a person's DNA. An example of a mutation is cancer. Living or working in an unhealthy environment can also be a cause for diseases. Diseases are more common in older people.
Treatments of disease.
Some diseases can be helped with medicine. Some disease is helped by surgery. Not every disease can be helped with medicine or surgery, though. Some diseases must be treated during the whole life; they are "chronic" diseases. An example is diabetes. Diabetes can be treated (made better) but it can not yet be cured (made to totally go away.) People who usually treat disease are called doctors or physicians.
Prevention of disease.
Some diseases that are common or very bad are tested for even in people who are healthy. "If these diseases are found early they can be treated before they cause problems." An example would be checking a woman for cervical cancer with a test called a pap smear. If cervical cancer is found early it can be fixed. If it is found later it usually causes death.
