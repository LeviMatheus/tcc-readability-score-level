A candy cane is a hard cane-shaped candy stick. It is traditionally white with red stripes and flavored with peppermint. It is also made in a variety of other flavors and colors. The candy cane is a traditional candy of the Christmas holiday in the United States, but it is possible to find them throughout the year.
