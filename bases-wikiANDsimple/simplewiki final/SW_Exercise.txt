Physical exercise.
Exercise can be an important part of physical therapy, weight loss, or sports performance.
Exercise can be fun, but it is important for the exercisor to do what he likes and eat enough calories, so when he exercises he is building up muscles, not just breaking them down for fuel. Carbohydrates are muscle-sparing; and if one does not get enough calories overall, there is the risk of burning muscles up with the fat to make up the deficit.
Exercise benefits.
Regular exercise has been shown to help high blood pressure, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and depression, among others.
