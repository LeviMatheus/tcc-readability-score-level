Pope (Latin: "papa" "father'") is the name several churches give to their highest spiritual leader. In English usually means the head of the Roman Catholic Church.
The "Annuario Pontificio", published every year by the Roman Catholic church's government in the Vatican has the most accurate list of popes. Its list is used here.
Popes with the shortest reigns.
This is the list of the 11 shortest-reigning popes.
The number of calendar days includes part days, e.g., if a pope's reign commenced on 1 August and he died on 2 August, this would count as having reigned for two calendar days.
