A printer is a piece of hardware for a computer. It is an instrument that must be connected to a computer which allows the users to print items on paper, such as letters and pictures. It can also work with Digital Cameras to print directly without the use of a Computer.
Cost of printers.
There are different costs with a printer. Printers that are more expensive to buy will usually be less expensive in the consumables (the ink, toner, or ribbon used by the printer). Therefore, laser printers are often more expensive to buy than inkjet printers. Inkjet printers on the other hand have a higher cost of consumables, the ink tanks are more expensive than the toner. Laser printers that can print color are still quite expensive.
