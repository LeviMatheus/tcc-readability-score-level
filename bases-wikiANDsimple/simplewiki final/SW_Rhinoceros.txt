A rhinoceros (also called a rhino for short) is any of five living species of mammals in the family Rhinocerotidae, of the order Perissodactyla.
Habitat.
All five are native to Africa or Asia. The two in Africa are the "White Rhinoceros" and the "Black Rhinoceros". The three in Asia (including islands of Indonesia) are the "Javan Rhinoceros", "Sumatran Rhinoceros", and "Indian Rhinoceros".
Life.
The rhinoceros is an herbivore.
Rhinoceroses have a large horn on the nose. Their horns are not like those of other horned mammals: the rhinoceros' horn is made of keratin packed together very tightly.
Rhinoceroses and Humans.
Only the White Rhinoceros is not in critical danger of becoming extinct because of humans killing them even though it is illegal, and the White Rhino in some danger of becoming extinct. Loss of habitat is also a danger to all rhinos. Rhinos are becoming extinct because people are still killing them just to get money even though the governtment made logging there habitat and poaching illegal.
Rhinoceros horns are used in Asian medicine, and for dagger handles in Yemen and Oman which is leading to extinction of these animals.
