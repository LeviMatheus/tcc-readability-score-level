McLean Stevenson (November 14, 1929 â€“ February 15, 1996) was an American actor. He is best known for his role as Henry Blake on the TV show, "M*A*S*H". He left the show in 1975 and his character was killed off.
His grandfather Adlai E. Stevenson was Vice-president of the United States to Grover Cleveland, and his cousin Adlai E. Stevenson II was Governor of Illinois and unsuccessfully ran for President twice in the 1950s losing to Dwight D. Eisenhower both times.
Ironically, Roger Bowen, who played in the same character he did in the 1970 movie version of "M*A*S*H", died the day after he did of the same cause, a heart attack.
