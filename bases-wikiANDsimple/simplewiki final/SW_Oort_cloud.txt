The Oort Cloud is a cloud of comets and other objects that scientists and astronomers believe exists beyond the orbit of Pluto, in what is called the Kuiper belt.
The Oort Cloud is believed to be the source of comets in the Solar System.

The Dutch astronomer Jan Hendrik Oort was the creator of the Oort Cloud idea. The Oort cloud was named after him, as were the Oort Comet, and Oort Constants
Structure.
The Oort cloud takes up a lot of space and has trillions of comets about tens of millions of kilometers apart.
the Oort cloud is made up of an Inner Oort cloud and an Outer Oort cloud. The Outer cloud is weakly bound to the sun and gives the solor system comets. The Inner Cloud is also called the Hill Cloud and may be the maker of comets.
The objects in the Oort cloud are believed to consist of much ice, and since the object 1996 PW was found, it is believed that rocky objects might be in the Oort Cloud.
Origins.
The Oort cloud is imaged as the remains of a disk made out of gas which surrounded the sun long ago.
Most believed that the Oort cloud was created the same way that science says the planets were created.
