Marbury v. Madison is a famous Supreme Court case that first established judicial review in the United States.
Following the election of 1800, Thomas Jefferson, a Democratic-Republican, was elected President of the United States. During his time as a lame duck (after losing the election but before leaving office), outgoing President John Adams, a member of the Federalist Party, started making other Federalists judges. His party was losing power, but by making Federalists judges that would serve for life, Adams was trying to keep Jefferson and his party from changing things too much.
All the new judges were approved by the Senate. Secretary of State John Marshall now had to deliver the judges the document (called a commission) that made them judges. Marshall delivered most of them, but not all as time ran out. He thought the new Secretary of State would deliver them, because even though the new office holders did not want the new judges, the judges were legally made. However, President Jefferson made sure the commissions were not delivered as he thought they were void.
One of the judges who did not get his commission was William Marbury. He sued (asked a court) the new Secretary of State James Madison, wanting his commission. Marbury asked the Supreme Court to order Madison to deliver the commission.
The Supreme Court made a 4-0 decision. Chief Justice John Marshall, the former Secretary of State, made a ruling that said that Marbury was entitled to his commission. However, Marshall said that a law that gave the Supreme Court the power to rule on the case was against the United States Constitution. Thus, the Supreme Court did not have the power to make Madison give Marbury his commission.
