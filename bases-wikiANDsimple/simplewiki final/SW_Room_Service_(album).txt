"Room Service" is a rock album by Canadian songwriter Bryan Adams released internationally in 2004 and in the U.S. the following year. "Open Road" was the first single taken from the album, followed by "Flying", "Room Service" and, as an American release, "This Side of Paradise". In the summer of 2005, "Open Road" was used the theme song in ESPN's SportsCenter series 50 States in 50 Days.
"East Side Story" was originally going to be released on Chicane's cancelled Album "Easy To Assemble" with Bryan Adams on vocals, albeit with a completely different composition.
