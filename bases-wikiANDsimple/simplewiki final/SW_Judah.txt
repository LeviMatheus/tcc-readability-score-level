The Kingdom of Judah was a Jewish kingdom that existed from 930 BCE to 586 BCE. It was located in the southern part of what is now called Israel.
The kingdom was created after the death of Saul when the tribe of Judah picked King David to rule them. After the death of King Solomon, son of David, ten of the twelve of the tribes of Israel did not want Solomon's son, Rehoboam to lead them. This caused the kingdom to split the Northern Kingdom, the Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom, the Kingdom of Judah. Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah. In 586 BCE, the king of Babylon took over Jerusalem and with it, Judah.
