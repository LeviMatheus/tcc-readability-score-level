A riding helmet, sometimes called a horse riding helmet, is a type of hat (cover for the head) made for people who ride horses. It is important to wear a riding helmet when riding. It is easy for a person to fall off a horse and hit his or her head. Riding helmets keep the rider of a horse from being hurt. Horses can accidentally step on a person who has fallen to the ground.
Helmets should be worn by all riders, but are most often worn by English style riders.
