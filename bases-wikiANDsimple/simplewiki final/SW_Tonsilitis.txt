Tonsilitis is a disease. The tonsils in the mouth get inflamed, and grow red. This may cause a sore throat or a fever. Sometimes the inflammation goes away on its own, but if it does not the tonsils may have to be surgically removed. This operation is called a "tonsilectomy".
The disease is caused by certain viruses most of the time, but can also be cause by bacteria. It easily spreads between humans.
