In 1845 another Irishman named John Philip Sheahan (died December 9, 1877, aged 61 years) built the Sir George Tavern (an hotel) which made Jugiong an important resting place on the new road, the "Great Southern Road", to Melbourne. The building was destroyed in a flood in 1852. The flood also destroyed the buildings at the town of Gundagai. Sheahan rebuilt the hotel with walls up to 500 mm thick and it is still in use, and still owned by the Sheahan family. It is the oldest family owned hotel in Australia.
