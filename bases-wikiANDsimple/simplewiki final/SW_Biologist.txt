A biologist is a scientist who studies biology. Biologists study plants and animals.
There are many different kinds of biologists. Some study fish and ocean plants. They are called marine biologists. Others study very small bacteria or viruses. Other scientists study groups of animals. People who look at DNA in cells are called geneticists. Some biologists study using cells in factories and companies, and that is called biotechnology.
