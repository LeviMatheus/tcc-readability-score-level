"My Fair Lady" is a musical. It is based on George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion". It was first performed on stage in 1956 starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison. It was made into a movie in 1964. The movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year. Audrey Hepburn stars in it, as does Rex Harrison.
GB Shaw never wanted to turn his book into a musical. That is why the film was created after his death.
