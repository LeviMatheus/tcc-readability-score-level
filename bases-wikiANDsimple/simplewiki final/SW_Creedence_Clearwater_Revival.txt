Creedence Clearwater Revival was a rock band from California, United States. Many people thought they were from the Southeastern United States because the group's music sounded like the country, folk, and blues music of that place. They were popular and most active in the 1960s and early 1970s. The members of the group were John Fogerty, his brother Tom Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook.
