Breton ("Brezhoneg", in Breton) is a Celtic language spoken in Brittany, in the north-west of France. It has 300,000 speakers but is in danger of dying because so many of them are old and not enough children are learning it. It is closely related to the Cornish language of Cornwall in the south-west of Great Britain, and Welsh. It is less closely related to the Goidelic languages of Scotland, Ireland and the Isle of Man.
