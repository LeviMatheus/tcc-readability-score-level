The triangle is a musical instrument with three sides and curved corners. There is always one corner where the sides do not join. This makes it possible for the instrument to vibrate.
The player holds a small piece of string or leather from which the triangle is hanging, and he makes a sound by hitting the triangle with a metal beater. In orchestras, where the percussionist may be playing several percussion instruments, the triangle may hang from a stand so that the player can move quickly to another instrument.
Triangles come in different sizes. Smaller ones will sound higher than larger ones.
The triangle can always be heard clearly above the sound of the orchestra or band.
