Saint Anna is the grandmother of Jesus. Saint Anna gave birth to the Virgin Mary, and Mary grew up and gave birth to Jesus. Saint Anna's husband is Saint Joachim, who is Mary's father. Saint Anna died at the age of 79 while her husband died at age 80.
Her name Anna is interperating of a Hebrew name Hanna. Joachim went to the temple to pray and wasn't admitted in because of his childlessness. Joachim ran away. Anna heard and prayed and sacrificed like mad. She promised she would bring the child up in God's name. An angel came to Anna and told her that God would grant her a baby. The angel went to Joachim too and told him the same thing. Joachim came home.
Anna had the baby soon after. She named the girl Mary. Anna continued to keep her promise. When Mary was about three years old, Joachim and Anna brought her up in The Second Temple.
The name Anna means grace, joy, or favor.
