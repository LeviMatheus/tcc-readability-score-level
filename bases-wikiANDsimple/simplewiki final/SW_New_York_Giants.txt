The New York Giants are an American football team. They are a part of the National Football League (NFL). Even though they are called the New York Giants they do not play in New York. They play in East Rutherford, New Jeresy. New York is right across the Hudson river from East Rutherford,so they consider New York as home. The Giants play in Giants Stadium in which they share with the New york Jets. However in 2009 a new stadium will be opened right next to the sight of the old stadium. The New York Giants started playing in 1925. They have won six championships. On February 3, 2008, the Giants beat the New England Patriots (17-14) to win their third Super Bowl championship.The previous two Super Bowl victories came against the Denver Broncos and the Buffalo Bills (when they won the game on a missed last second field goal that went "wide right".
