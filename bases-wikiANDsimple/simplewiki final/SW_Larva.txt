A larva is a baby of certain kinds of animals. Amphibian and insect babies are called larvae. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis in some cases) when it grows up. Larvae is the word for more than one larva. Maggots and caterpillars are both larvae.
