There are two types of Japanese traditional dance:"Odori", which was created in the Edo period; and "Mai", which was created in the western part of Japan. Odori came from Kabuki drama, and is more of a male dance. Mai is usually danced by female dancers, and is mostly done at houses, instead of on stage.
A type of the Mai style of Japanese dance is the "Kyomai" or Kyoto Style Dance. Kyomai was created in the 17th century Tokugawa cultural period. It is influenced by the elegance of the manners of the Japanese Imperial Court.
