Drought is when not enough rain falls for a long time. Crops and other plants need water to grow, and land animals need it to live. It can become dangerous to people; causing famine and even creating deserts. Drought is a natural event, caused by other weather events like El Nino and high pressure systems. Drought can also be triggered by people cutting down forests, by global warming, and by diverting rivers or emptying lakes. By collecting rainwater or changing sea water into drinking water, people can lessen the impact of drought.
