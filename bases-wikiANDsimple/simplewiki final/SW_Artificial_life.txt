Artificial life (commonly Alife or alife) is a field of study which examines systems related to life, its processes, and its evolution. This is done with simulations using computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. There are three main kinds of alife, named for their approaches: "soft", from software; "hard", from hardware; and "wet", from biochemistry. Artificial life imitates traditional biology by trying to "recreate" biological phenomena. The term "artificial life" is often used to specifically refer to soft alife.
