Carlos Sastre Candil (born 22 April 1975 in Legan√©s, Madrid) is a Spanish cyclist. He races for Team CSC Saxo Bank and he won the Tour de France in 2008. He is a climbing specialist and has been very consistent, finishing consistently in the top 10 of the Vuelta and the Tour de France.
In 2009, his contract expires with CSC, and will probably have to find another team.
