The African Union (abbreviated AU) is an international organization consisting of fifty-three African member countries. Founded in Durban in July 2002, the AU was formed as a replacement to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African Economic Community (AEC).
The AU, in the future, aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State. The purpose of the organisation is to help secure the continent's democracy, human rights, and a sustainable economy, especially by bringing an end to conflict between African nations and creating an effective common market.
