Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states in Germany. The Danish name is Slesvig-Holsten, the Low Saxon name is Sleswig-Holsteen and the Frisian name is Sleeswyk-Holstein.
Schleswig-Holstein borders on Denmark in the North, the North Sea in the West, the Baltic Sea and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in the East, and Lower Saxony and Hamburg in the South. Kiel is the capital of this Bundesland.
The countryside is lowlands with virtually no mountains. The highest elevation in the state is the Bungsberg at only metres. There are many lakes, especially in the eastern part of Holstein called the Holsteinische Schweiz ("Switzerland of Holstein").
