Tennis is a sport played with a rubber ball, a racket, and a court. There are many different kinds of courts, like grass, clay, or a hard court. The goal of tennis is to hit the ball over the net into the other player’s court. When the other player can’t return the ball, a point is won. The game is played with two or four people. When it’s played with two people, it’s called “singles”, and when it’s played with four people, it’s called “doubles”.
A tennis game has a number of sets. Each set has a number of games, and each game has points. The points are counted love (0), fifteen (15), thirty (30), forty (40). If both players get to forty, the score is "deuce" from which 2 more points are needed to win the game. When one player reaches six games, it is one set. If it is a five set match, the player who reaches three sets first is the winner. If the game count reaches 5-5, the set must be won with two more games than the other player, like 7-5 or 8-6. When the game count gets to 6-6, a "tiebreaker" is played. In a tiebreak, players have to get at least seven points while getting two more points than the other player to win the set. In tiebreak points are called “one,” “two,” etc.
The game started in England during the 1800s. Tennis is now a sport that is played at the Olympic Games. They also have big tournaments like the U.S. Open, Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. These four are known as Grand Slam titles.And, right now, according to wikipedia, tennis’s official name is "lawn tennis". From 1998, every September 23rd, is called "Tennis Day".
