Oneness Pentecostalism is a protestant Christian movement. The movement split from the Pentecostal movement. Followers believe that the bible should be read literally. They believe in one god, and reject ideas like the Trinity. Jesus is fully god and flully human. This makes them different from most Unitarians who say that the son of god was only man. Oneness Pentecostalists say the belief in the trinity is really the belief in three different gods. The 10 Commandments say there is only one god, so Trinity is wrong.
