The Aardvark ("Orycteropus afer") is a mammal from Africa. Its name means "earth pig" in the language Afrikaans.
Taxonomy.
The Aardvark is the only surviving member of the family Orycteropodidae and of the order Tubulidentata.
The Aardvark looks a bit like other animals, like the South American anteaters but they are not related.
Appearance.
Adult aardvarks weighs about 50 Kilograms (110 pounds) and a little more than one meter (45 inches) long.
Life.
Aardvarks eat mostly ants and termites. They have a long sticky tongue which makes it easy to pick up many ants at once.
Aardvarks are nocturnal, which means they are awake at night and asleep during the day.
