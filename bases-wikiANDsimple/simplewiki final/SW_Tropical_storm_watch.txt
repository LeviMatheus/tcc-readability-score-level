A tropical storm watch is a special kind of weather advisory that is issued by the National Hurricane Center, when tropical storm effects are a possible threat to an area within 36 hours. Tropical storm effects include winds from 39 to 73 mph (35 to 64 knots, 63 to 117 km/h). Maritime flags indicate this with a single square red flag.
