Uncyclopedia is a website parody of Wikipedia founded by Jonathan Huang and "stillwaters". Its slogan is "the content-free encyclopedia that anyone can edit ", its logo is a hollow potato named Sophia, making fun of Wikipedia's globe logo. It is a comedy wiki. Users make fun of things by creating pages about them. They have a guide on writing called HTBFANJS (How To Be Funny And Not Just Stupid).
