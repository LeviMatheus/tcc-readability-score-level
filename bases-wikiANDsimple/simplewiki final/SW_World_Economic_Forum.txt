The World Economic Forum is a foundation based in Geneva, Switzerland. It is known for holing a yearly meeting in Davos. Important leaders form politics (such as presidents) and the economy are given an opportunity to talk about subjects that concern everyone. Very often, these subjects concern globalization.
These meetings are often critizised because they are seen as a vehicle to further capitalism in the world. During the meetings, which invole the G8, access to the village of Davos is heavily controlled (It is usually not possible to get there during such a meeting). Also, the right to come together freely, and hold demonstrations is heavily restricted in the area around Davos during these meetings. This is one of the rights given by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Usually the Swiss army helps secure the area. Meetings and protests are usually held in other cities in Switzerland during the World Economic Forum.
