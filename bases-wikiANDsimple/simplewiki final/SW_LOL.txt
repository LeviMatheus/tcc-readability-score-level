LOL is an internet slang term that means "laugh out loud". It also means mute in Persian and is a native Dutch word (not an acronym) which, conveniently, means "fun" ("lollig" means "funny").
In Welsh, lol means nonsense - e.g., if a person wanted to say "utter nonsense" in Welsh, they would say "rwtsh lol". It does not mean anything in any other language. LOL is usually used on the internet or when text messaging.
