Philodendron ("tree lover") is the name commonly given to some species of the Arum family, Araceae. Currently, over 1000 different species are known. The plants are evergreen flowering plants. Some of them are vines, some can grow as epiphytes. Most of them grow like bushes. They can reach a height of about 6 meters.
Very often, Philodendrons are grown as houseplants. They grow quickly, and are easy to care for.
Sometimes Monstera are still caled Philodendron. That plant is very similar.
Philodendrons are sometime grown because they can neutralise some poisons commonly found indoors, most notably Formaldehyde, Carbon monoxide and Benzene.
