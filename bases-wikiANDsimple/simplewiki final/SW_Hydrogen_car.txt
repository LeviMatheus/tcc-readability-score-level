A Hydrogen car is a vehicle that uses hydrogen as its fuel for motive power. The term may refer to a transportation vehicle, such as an automobile, or any other vehicle that uses hydrogen in a similar way, such as an aircraft.
Hydrogen is the simplest and the most abundant element in the universe. Therefore, It is said infinity resources because it's made from water. Despite its simplicity and rich, hydrogen doesn't occur naturally as a gas on the earth: it's always combined with other elements. Hydrogen is high in energy, yet an engine that burns pure hydrogen produces almost no pollution.
- We can gain hydrogen from water by using various energy, so it is almost infinity resources.
- As hydrogen is diatomic molecular, Combustion product is only water. Therefore, it does not produce the harmful gasses that gasoline and diesel cars produce, such as carbon dioxide.
- Hydrogen itself is nonpoisonous, and it is easy to permeate air. Therefore, in case of outflow, hydrogen is safer than any other gas.
- As waste gas of hydrogen is steam and hydrogen is made from water, it is circulation fuel.
- Temperament that hydrogen is easy to be fired occurs early autoignition and backfire because hydrogen's burning rate is fast.
- As autoignition temperature of hydrogen is higher than diesel oil, it has difficulty in compression ignition.
- As adiabatic flame temperature of hydrogen is higher than other fuels, generation of nitrogen oxide increases.
(1) What is a Fuel Cell?
In principle, Fuel cells are electrochemical devices like batteries that convert the chemical energy of a fuel directly and very efficiently into electricity (DC) and heat, thus doing away with combustion. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down or require recharging. It will produce energy in the form of electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied.
A fuel cell consists of two electrodes sandwiched around an electrolyte. Oxygen passes over one electrode and hydrogen over the other, generating electricity water and heat. Layers of materials with distinct electrochemical properties are sandwiched together to form a single galvanic cell. At the heart lies a membrane that can only be crossed by charged molecules. Gas-permeable electodes coated with a catalyst adhere to this memebrane, adding a layer on either side. There electrodes are in turn connected to a device that can utilize electricity. Hydrogen gas flows into channels on one face of the cell and migrates through that electrode, while the same occurs with oxygen gas along the opposite electrode. Spurred by a catalyst, favorable chemistry causes the hydrogen to oxidize into hydrogen protons and give up its electrons to the neighboring electrode, which thereby becomes the anode. this buildup of negative charge then follows the path of least resistance via the external circuit to the other electrode. It is this flow of electrons through a circuit that creates elecricity.
Problem to solve for the practical use of hydrogen car
Most important problem involed practical use of hydrogen car is hydrogen storage materials. If it uses a fuel cell that generates electricity through reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, it doesn't matter. However, if method is that hydrogen is sprayed to internal-combustion engine, it does matter. Now hydrogen storage tank with highest possibility is method using metal hydride. Metal hydride is that reversible reaction between metal and hydrogen make new form of compound. Now Hydrogen storing technology using Hydrogen storage compound metal comes to practical use step in the side of technical, however, hydrogen storing capacity per weight is no match for demand of user, so this technology does not wide use yet. Therefore, that problem should be solved.
