Zinc is a type of metal. Its symbol on the periodic table is "Zn". When it has been newly cut, zinc has a shiny white-gray color, but if it is exposed to air, it will not stay shiny for long.
Zinc is used in electrical batteries, and in motorboats to slow rusting. The motor of a motorboat often has a "bullet" of zinc, that will corrode easily, but will help other metal parts of the motor to stay rust free. Many nails and pails also have a zinc outer surface to prevent rusting.
We need a little bit of zinc to help our body run well. If we do not get enough zinc in our food, we can get sick. Some people even say that when we get colds, we should take more zinc. Vitamins and cereals contain zinc to make sure that we get enough.
