Haemophilia is a blood condition that means bleeding does not stop. The bleeding occurs because the blood does not clot. A person with a small cut or internal bleed (bruise) could bleed to death. They do not bleed more than a normal person, but they bleed for much longer. The word comes from the Greek words "haima" "blood" and "philia" "to love"
It usually affects males. It is passed from mother to child through genes.
Haemophilia A happens in about 1 in 5,000–10,000 male births. Haemophilia B happens in about 1 in every 20,000–34,000 male births.
This happens because each male needs a X and a Y chromosome; but because the Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome, some genes are missing. Most importantly in haemophilia, it is the H gene that is missing. If gene h (from the X chromosone) is recessive (weak) then it would be replaced by the gene H (from the Y chromosone). But when gene H is missing from the Y chromosone then gene h, the weak one from the X chromosone, takes its place and causes haemophilia.
A person with haemophilia is called a haemophiliac.
