The iMac is an all-in-one personal computer that was first released in 1998. It was made by Apple Inc. and the first ones came in many colors.
The next version of iMacs were white and had a screen on a "neck" which came from the base.
The third version of iMacs were white, flat and on a stand, meaning the whole computer was hovering above the ground. It had built-in wireless internet and bluetooth. Apple later added a built-in camera and microphone, as well as Intel processors, which was a big change for Apple.
Apple currently uses this design of iMac, but changed the colors and materials to aluminum and glass instead of white plastic.
