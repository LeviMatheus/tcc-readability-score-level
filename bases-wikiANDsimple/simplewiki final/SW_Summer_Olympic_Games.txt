The Summer Olympic Games or the Games of the Olympiad are an international sporting event which are held every four years by the International Olympic Committee. The "Games", as they are often called, are held in a different city each time. It is a great honour for a city to be "awarded" (given) the right to hold the Olymic Games. Two years after the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympic Games are held. These are always in a cold, mountainous place because the sports are all snow and ice sports such as skiing. Many more countries send athletes to the Summer Olympics than to the Winter Olympics.
The Olympic Games were first held in Ancient Greece more than two thousand years ago. The first modern Summer Olympic Games where held in Athens in 1896. There were 200 athletes from Greece and 45 athletes from 13 other countries. From 1904, medals are given to the three best athletes or teams in each sport.
The earliest Games consisted of 42 events only, but it is expected that 10,500 athletes compete in the 302 events on the program for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.
