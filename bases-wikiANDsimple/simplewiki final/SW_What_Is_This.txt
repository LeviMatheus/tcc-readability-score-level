What Is This? was a rock band from Los Angeles, California. They started around the same time as Red Hot Chili Peppers. Before 1980, their name was Anthym. Hillel Slovak, Flea, and Jack Irons were members of both bands, but Slovak and Irons left after Red Hot Chili Peppers' first album. After Natasha Shneider joined the band, they changed their name to Walk The Moon, and then to Eleven.
