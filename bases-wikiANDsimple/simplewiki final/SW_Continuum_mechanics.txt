Continuum mechanics is a branch of physics (specifically mechanics) where matter is understood as continuous.
This is useful in engineering (especially civil engineering and mechanical engineering) and in physics that deals with deformation of matter. It is important for both: solids "and" fluids (i.e., liquids and gases).
The fact that matter is made of atoms and that it commonly has some sort of heterogeneous "microstructure" is ignored in the simplifying approximation that is used in continuum mechanics.
