Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was the first President of the Republic of Turkey and the anti-imperialist leader of Turkey until his death in 1938.
Mustafa Kemal was born on May 19 1881. His birth place was Thessaloniki (now Θεσσαλονίκη in Greece). He was given the name Atatürk (Father of All Turks) later. His father's name was Ali Rıza Efendi. His mother's name was Zübeyde Hanım. He also had a sister whose name was Makbule (Atadan).
When the Ottoman Empire collapsed after the First World War, Atatürk organised the Nationalist movement that established the modern secular Republic of Turkey. Visitors to Turkey are often surprised by the importance given to Ataturk in present-day Turkey.
In fact few countries have such a person in their history. Not only was he a successful military commander, but he established a democratic constitution and put in place reforms that set Turkey on the road to becoming a modern, developed nation.
