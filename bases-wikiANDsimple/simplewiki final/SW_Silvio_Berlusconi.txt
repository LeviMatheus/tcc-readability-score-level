Silvio Berlusconi (born September 29, 1936 in Milan) is an Italian politician, leader of a right-wing coalition named "Casa delle Libert√†" (House of Freedoms) and leader of the right-wing party "Forza Italia".
He has been Head of the Italian Government in 1994 and a second time since 2001 until 2006, when he was defeated at the political elections by Romano Prodi, leader of the left-wing coalition named "L'unione" (The Union). This coalition won the elections only for few votes: 24,000 at the "Camera dei Deputati", one of the two Chambers of the Italian Parliament, and only 4 senators more than Berlusconi in the Senate.
Silvio Berlusconi is also the owner of many Italian enterprises, for instance the television network "Mediaset".
