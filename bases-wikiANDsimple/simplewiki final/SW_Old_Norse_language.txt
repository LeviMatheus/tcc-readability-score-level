Old Norse is a Germanic language that was spoken in Scandinavia, during the Viking Age, until about year 1300.
Also, the language was spoken in Iceland, the Faeroe Islands, Orkney Islands and other places, where Scandinavians started settlements (similar to colonies).
Modern Icelandic is the modern language, that looks most like Old Norse, when written.
Another language, similar to Old Norse, is Elfdalian.
