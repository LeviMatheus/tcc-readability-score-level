The Fender Stratocaster, also called a Strat, is a type of electric guitar made by Leo Fender and Freddie Tavares in the early 1950s, and are being made still today. The Stratocaster has been used by many famous guitarists, as well as the Gibson Les Paul, the Fender Telecaster and the Gibson SG.
The Stratocaster has been copied as well. A guitar may look the same as a Stratocaster, but if it is not produced by Fender or Squier it is called a strat copy.
Fender Stratocaster copies are mostly very cheap and low quality, but some guitar builders make high quality clones of the Stratocaster. Fender makes Stratocasters made in the United States of America, which are the highest quality. They also make Stratocasters which are made in Japan, but only sell them to the Japanese. Stratocasters are also made in Korea and sold as special editions. The cheapest Fenders are made in Mexico, but despite their price, these Stratocasters are very good quality guitars compared to the copies which are usually made in China. Squier makes Stratocasters in China and Indonesia. People like Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton and Hank Marvin used a stratocaster.
