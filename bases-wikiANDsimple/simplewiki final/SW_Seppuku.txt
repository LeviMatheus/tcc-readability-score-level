Seppuku is a Japanese ritual when a Samurai cuts his belly. It was considered that seppuku was an honorable way to die.
Seppuku is also referred to as hara-kiri, which is translated from Japanese as "belly-cutting". The Japanese considered, though, that this name was offensive for such an honorable cause.
Overview.
Seppuku was a key part of bushido, the code of the samurai warriors; it was used by warriors so that they would not fall into enemy hands and be ashamed. It was possible also that a samurai received an order from his master to commit seppuku. Since seppuku was an honorable act, a warrior was allowed, in some cases, to commit it, rather than to be executed, so that he could protect his honor. It was not expected that warriors, who were not considered samurai, to commit seppuku. Samurai women had to ask for permission to commit seppuku.
This act could be performed either with a ritual, or quietly on the battlefield, while other warriors fight the enemy.
The main weapon used to commit seppuku was the samurai's knife called tant≈ç or the short sword, called wakizashi. A samurai who wants to commit seppuku would take the weapon he chose, he would open his kimono, stab the blade into his belly and then he would make a deep cut from left to right. An assistant of the warrior committing seppuku (called "kaishakunin") would finally decapitate the warrior.
