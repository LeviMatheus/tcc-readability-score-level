Frank Vincent Zappa (December 21, 1940 - December 4, 1993) was an American musician and composer. He was known for his strange style of music, which was often weird and funny. He made various types of music and many albums. Zappa worked with many other musicans, most notably his 1960s group The Mothers of Invention and his friend and blues singer Captain Beefheart.
Zappa was born in Baltimore, Maryland, but spent most of his life in Southern California. He grew up in the desert town of Palmdale, California. Zappa wrote a very funny song about his life there. It was called "Let's Make The Water Turn Black". It was a true story about two brothers who did some strange things. Zappa had four children with his wife Gail. They gave them all very unusual names: Moon Unit, Dweezil, Ahmet, and Diva.
His most popular song was probably a song he sang in the early 1980s with his daughter, Moon Unit, called "Valley Girl,". The song was based on Moon Unit making fun of some local girls at her school.
Zappa was openly against things like drugs, guns, and censoring music. He often tried to see what he could get away with, which sometimes got him in trouble.
Zappa died from Prostate cancer in 1993.
