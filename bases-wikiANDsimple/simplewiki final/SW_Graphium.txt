"Graphium" is a genus of mostly tropical swallowtail butterflies commonly known as swordtails. Native to Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania, the genus is represented by over 100 species. Their coloration is as variable as the habitats they frequent; from rainforest to savannah. Some possess tails which may be long and swordlike, while others lack any hindwing extensions. "Graphium" species are often sighted at mud puddles.
