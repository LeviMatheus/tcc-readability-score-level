Philip II of Spain (May 21, 1527 – September 13, 1598) was, starting in 1556, king of Spain, Italy and Burgundy, the Netherlands, Franche-Comté, Naples, and overseas Spanish America. He was born at Valladolid, and was the only son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and his wife to live until he was an adult. He was Catholic. His rule was filled with troubles that caused him to be harsh on his people and other nations.
Childhood.
For the first seven years of his life, Philip moved between different castles with his mother. In 1534 he moved into a private house in Salamanca to start his schooling. His mother died in 1539 and he brought her body to Granada, where her grandparents Ferdinand and Isabella were buried. He left Spain in 1547 and moved to the Netherlands, where his father's family was from. His father wanted him to become more European but the people there thought he was too cold and serious.
