In botany, "flora" (plural: floras or florae) has two meanings.
The first meaning refers to all plant life in an area or time period (especially the naturally occurring or indigenous plant life).
The second meaning refers to a "book or other work" which describes the plant species in an area or time period, with the aim of allowing identification.
The term flora comes from Latin language Flora, the goddess of flowers in Roman mythology. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna.
Plants are grouped into floras based on region, period, special environment, or climate. Regions can be geographically distinct habitats like mountain vs. flatland. Floras can mean plant life of an historic era as in "fossil flora".
Bacterial organisms are sometimes included in a flora. Other times, the terms "bacterial flora" and "plant flora" are used separately.
