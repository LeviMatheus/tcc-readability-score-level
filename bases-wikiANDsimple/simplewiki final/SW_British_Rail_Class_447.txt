Class 447 was the designation given to the Electric multiple unit trains that would have run the shuttle services (branded the "Battersea Bullet") between London Victoria and the entertainment complex planned for the site of the former Battersea Power Station. Three units were planned, each of four cars, and since the trains would have been privately owned by the operator of the entertainment complex, British Rail allocated carriage numbers 99469-99481 (from the private owner carriage series) for the individual vehicles.
