Teltow-Fl채ming is a "Kreis" (district) in the southwestern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district was made in December 1993 by joining the old districts of Luckenwalde, J체terbog and Zossen, but also including small parts from other former districts such as Luckau.
"Fl채ming-Skate" is a 160km long route specially for inline skating, the only such route in Germany.
Curiously, the town of Teltow is not a part of the district Teltow-Fl채ming, just as the town of Dahme is not a part of the district of Dahme-Spreewald.
