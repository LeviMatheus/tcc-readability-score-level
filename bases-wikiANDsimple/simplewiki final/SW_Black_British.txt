Black British are people who have British nationality but are originally from Africa or African-Caribbean people or anyone who sees them self as black.
The 2001 UK census says there are 1.2 million Black British people. They are 2.33% of the population of the United Kingdom.
In the past, Black British used to mean any immigrant who was not English, like British Asians, but people say that it was because of racism in England at that time.
