Herpetology is the branch of zoology concerned with reptiles and amphibians. It studies about cold-blooded animals like salamanders, frogs, toads, snakes, lizards, turtles, tuataras and crocodilians.
Two classes are defined in herpetolgoy: reptiles and amphibians. Both of them are cold-blooded, and are similar in other ways as well. Many amphibians do not have lungs at all, but use their wet skin to breathe. Reptiles have a dry skin, usually protected by scales.
