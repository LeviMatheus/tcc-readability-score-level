PlayStation 3 is Sony's third video game console. It was released in Japan on November 11, 2006. It came out on November 17, 2006 in North America, and was released in Australia and Europe on 23 March 2007. It is going against the new Microsoft Xbox 360 and Nintendo Wii consoles. Sony's previous consoles were the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation (PSOne).
The console is sold in two models. One costs $399 and has a 40 gigabyte hard drive. This model cannot play PlayStation 2 games. The other costs $499 and has an 80 gigabyte hard drive. When the PlatStation 3 was released, there were two different models. One had a 20 gigabyte hard drive and cost $399. The other had a 60 gigabyte hard drive and cost $599. Sony stopped making the 20 gigabyte console in North America after the 60 gigabyte version "sold ten times as many" as the 20 gigabyte version.
The PS3 is according to Sony the most powerful seventh generation console, however many people that create computer games have recently stated that both the PS3 and Xbox 360 are about equal. It is more expensive than the Xbox 360 or Wii. Some people complain that the games are not as good as games on the Xbox 360. An upside is that to access the online mode to play and interact with other people is free unlike the Xbox in which must be paid for.
It is the only seventh generation console capable of using Blu-ray discs.
In July 2007, Sony announced that they would be cutting the price of the PS3 in the United States. Sony also replaced the 60 gigabyte version with an 80 gigabyte version.
In October, a new version of the Playstation 3 which is the 40 GB model was introduced and the price of the 60 GB model was further reduced. A white version of the 40 GB model was also set to release in Japan in November.
