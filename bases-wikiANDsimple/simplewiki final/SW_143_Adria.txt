143 Adria is a fairly big main belt asteroid. This dark-coloured asteroid is probably made of carbonate and chondrite.
It was found by J. Palisa on February 23, 1875 at Pula and named after the Adriatic Sea, on the coast where the asteroid was found.
One occultation by Adria has been reported so far, from Japan on August 21, 2000. A somewhat spherical shape measuring 98 Ã— 86 km was seen.
