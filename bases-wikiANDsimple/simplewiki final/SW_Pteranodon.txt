Pteranodon was a big pterosaur from the Late Cretaceous period.
Appearance.
With its wings open it was up to 9 meters across. "Pteranodon" might have live much like and albatross, spending a lot of time over the ocean, looking for fish. It had no teeth in its long mouth, and it had a small pouch like a pelican at the back of its jaw. "Pteranodon" had a big crest at the back of its head. "Pteranodon longiceps" had a straight crest that went backwards, and "Pteranodon sternbergi" had a bigger, flatter crest that went upward.
Pteranodons like modern birds did not have teeth in their beaks. This was unlike Pterodactylus which had teeth in their beaks.
Fossil Pteranodons often have been found in Kansas.
