A vine is any plant of the genus Vitis. These plants make berries which can be made into wine. These plants are different from other plants. They have special ways to climb structures, like trees. Therefore, Vine often refers to such climbing plants (which are unrelated to the "Vine" plant). Sometimes, such plants are referred to as Climber. Ivy or Liana are examples of such plants.
