Sultan is a name for some Islamic rulers or monarch. The wife of a sultan is called a sultana.
The word sultan was an Arabic language noun meaning "strength", "authority", or "rulership". Later, it came to be used as the title of certain Muslim rulers who claimed full sovereignty. They did not have to take orders from any higher ruler, without claiming the overall caliphate.
The dynasty and lands ruled by the Sultan is called a Sultanate.
