Fertilization (English spelling: fertilisation) is what happens when a male's sperm goes inside of a female's ovum (or "egg") and form a zygote. Fertilization is also called "conception".
In humans, biologists call a fertilized egg a zygote. It is called an embryo from 3-8 weeks (the "embryonic period".) Then after 8 weeks, it is called a fetus.
If it continues to grow normally it can eventually become a baby.
This difference in what people believe has led to many arguments over abortion.
