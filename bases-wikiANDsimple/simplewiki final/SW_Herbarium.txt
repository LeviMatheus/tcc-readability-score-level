In botany, an herbarium is the building where the specimens are stored, or the scientific institute that not only stores but researches these specimens. A dried plant mounted on a sheet also is an herbarium.
In scientific literature herbaria are recognized by acronyms,
for example NY specimens are kept in New York Botanical garden.
