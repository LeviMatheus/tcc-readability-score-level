The Neanderthal (, also with, and), or Neandertal, was a species of the "Homo" genus (type) ("Homo neanderthalensis" or "Homo sapiens neanderthalensis") which lived in Europe and parts of western and central Asia. Approximately 130,000 years ago, Neanderthal characteristics had developed fully (some characteristics existed before) and by 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals disappeared from Asia. In Europe, scientists found skeletons that proved that Neanderthals lived in Europe until 30,000 years ago.
