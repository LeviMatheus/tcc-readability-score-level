Lodging or holiday accommodation is a type of accommodation. People who travel and stay away from home for more than a day need lodging mainly for sleeping. Other purposes are safety, shelter from cold and rain, and to have a place to store luggage and being able to take a shower.
They do that in a hotel, hostel or hostal, a private home (commercially, i.e. a bed and breakfast or guest house place, in a tent, caravan/camper (often on a campsite). In addition there are make-shift solutions.
Lodging may also refer to when cereal crops fall over, often due to wind or rain pressure, making grain harvest difficult.
