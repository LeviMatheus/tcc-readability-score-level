Moas were the biggest birds ever known. The biggest ones grew up to 3.6 meters (12 feet) tall, and weighed as much as 250 kilograms (550 pounds).
All moas lived in New Zealand. Many different kinds of these birds lived in that place until about 100 or 200 years after the first people came there (the Māori), in about 1300. All moas were dead, it is thought, by about 1500. They had been eaten.
There are stories of moas still alive, but men of science do not say this.
