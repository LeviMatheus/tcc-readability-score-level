Maria Sharapova (born April 19, 1987) is a tennis player. She was born in Nyagan, Western Siberia in Russia on April 19, 1987. They soon moved from Belarus to protect themselves from the dangerous Chernobyl nuclear accident. The Sharapov1 family moved again in 1989, when Maria became interested in tennis, when watching her father play, and played tennis with a second-hand racquet. She would practise tennis by hitting the tennis ball against the wall everyday, and her dad soon noticed that she was very good at the sport
Maria's tennis coaches told the Sharapovs that they should move to Moscow, Russia, to get better training. The Sharapovs move again, from Moscow, to follow Maria's coach, Martina Navratilova's advice, to move to the United States.
There was a problem, though. Maria's mother, Yelena, could not get a visa to go to the United States. Meanwhile, Maria and her dad tried to get Maria to go to a famous sports school, and they also had to learn English. Maria showed so much talent that soon, she got a full scholarship to attend the school. At first though, Maria's dad had pay for Maria to stay at the famous school, doing all sorts of jobs so that they could be able to pay for the fee.
Maria trained harder and harder. She was videotaped when practicing, and recorded her every move. Then, she would watch the videos with her coaches to watch her form, emotions, and expressions.
Maria began to win tournaments and many people started to notice her. Her games improved, and Maria got more and more fans.
Maria has won 22 titles in her career, including three Grand Slam championships: Wimbledon in 2004, US Open in 2006 and Australian Open in 2008.
