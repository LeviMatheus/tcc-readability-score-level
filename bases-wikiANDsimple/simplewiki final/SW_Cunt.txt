Cunt is an abusive word that is used against people. It can also be slang for the vagina.
Unlike many words of profanity that came from Anglo-Saxon, this word comes from a Latin one ("cuneus", meaning a wedge shape). After the Norman invasion of England, it replaced the native word for vagina, mægþblæd.
