In music, a Battle of the Bands is a contest where many bands compete against each other to see who is the "best" band. Battles of the Bands are most common with rock music bands. The winner is usually chosen by judges or by the reaction of the audience to a band's performance. The winner can then receive a prize which could be money or a recording contract.
