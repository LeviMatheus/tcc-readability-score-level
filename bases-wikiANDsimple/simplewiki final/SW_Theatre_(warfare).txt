Some wars are fought in one theatre. Other wars are fought in many different theatres. There were many theatres in World War I and World War II. The Napoleonic wars were the first multi-theatre war in modern times.
The use of the word "theatre" for war was first seen in the book "On War" by Carl von Clausewitz.
