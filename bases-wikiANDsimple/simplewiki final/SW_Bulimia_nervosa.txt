Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is a disease and a type of eating disorder. It is when a person wants to starve his or her self. People who have it feel that they are fat and want to be skinny. When they are hungry, they eat a lot of food. Then, they try to take it back by vomiting, exercising, or using drugs. Sometimes, they do all three.
Symptoms.
The person with bulimia eats large amounts of food. Then, they want to get rid of it. To do this, they vomit, exercise, or use drugs. They do this at least two times a week. The person always thinks about how his or her body looks, and he or she wants to be skinny. The person is usually underweight, and they may also have anorexia nervosa.
Risks.
Bulimia nervosa can hurt a person. Because vomit has a lot of acid in it, doing it a lot can burn the person's mouth, throat, or teeth. Someone can lose nutrients or fluids in his or her body. Glands in one's throat and face may get bigger and hurt. He or she cannot recover from being sick with other things, and a person can get muscle or heart problems.
People who get bulimia.
Most people who get bulimia are women, men and sometimes even depressed/anxious animals generally ages 10 to 25. People who had bad things happen to them or who have lots of money are more likely to get the disease too. One is also likely to get it if he or she is smart or likes things to be perfect.
