Incomplete metamorphosis are words used to tell about how some insects grow. It is also called hemimetabolism.
Insects change how they look and what they can do when they grow. Some insects, the insects that have incomplete metamorphosis, have three different life stages. These insects start as eggs, which are sometimes so small you cannot see them. When the egg hatches, a nymph comes out. Nymphs are just baby insects. Most of the time, the nymph looks just like the adult, but it is smaller than the adult and does not have wings. After the nymph grows, it changes again, this time into an adult with wings so it can fly.
Some insect nymphs are aquatic, which means they live in water. These nymphs usually have gills and look very different from the adults they will turn into. Nymphs that live in water are called naiads.
