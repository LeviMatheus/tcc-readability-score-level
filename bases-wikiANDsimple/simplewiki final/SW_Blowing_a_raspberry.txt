Blowing a raspberry or making a Bronx cheer is to make a noise made to make fun of a person or persons, made by sticking out the tongue between the lips and blowing to make a sound similar to flatulence. The term "Bronx Cheer" is used sarcastically because it is not a cheer, it is used to show disapproval. The term was created as a reference to Bronx, New York, and the call used by spectators in Yankee Stadium. It can be classified phonetically as a "linguolabial trill".
