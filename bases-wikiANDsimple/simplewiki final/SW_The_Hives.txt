The Hives are a Swedish rock band that started in 1993 but rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group of the garage rock revival, playing garage punk. Their breakthrough came with the release of the "best-of" compilation "Your New Favourite Band", featuring their most commercially successful song "Hate to Say I Told You So".
