Breathing is the means by which our lungs remove carbon dioxide (CO2) take in oxygen, a gas needed along with glucose to produce energy. The air going in and out of the mouth or nose when animals "breathe" is called the "breath".
CO2 must be removed because it is a waste product and is too much CO2 is poisonous.
