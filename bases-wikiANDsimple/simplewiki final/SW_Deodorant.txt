Deodorant is anything that takes away an odor, or bad smell. Often, it means something people put on their bodies so their sweat does not smell as bad. The most commonly used deodorants are for use on the armpits. These are also an anti-perspirant because they reduce the creation of sweat. There are deodorants for other places on the body also. Deodorant can be sold in the form of spray, bottles, or sticks that are rolled onto the body.
