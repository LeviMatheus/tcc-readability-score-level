Camouflage is the method that makes it very difficult to see an object that normally could be seen very well. The method is to change how it looks so that it looks so much like its surrounding environment that it cannot be seen without special concentration. Examples include a tiger's stripes and the battledress of a modern soldier.
Camouflage is a form of deception. The word camouflage comes from the French word "camoufler" meaning "to disguise."
Natural camouflage.
In nature, there is a strong evolutionary pressure for animals to blend into their environment or conceal their shape. For prey animals it is important not be seen by predators and for predators it is important to be able to look for prey without beeing seen. Natural camouflage is one method that animals use to come to this result. There are a number of methods of doing so. One is for the animal to blend in with its surroundings, while another is for the animal to disguise itself as something uninteresting or something dangerous.
Some animals also simulate natural movement, e.g., of a leaf in the wind. Other animals attach or attract natural materials to their body for concealment.
A few animals have a chromatic response, they change color in changing environments, either seasonally (ermine, snowshoe hare) or far more rapidly like the chameleon and the cephalopod family.
Some herd animals adopt a similar pattern to make it difficult to distinguish a single animal. Examples include stripes on zebras.
The use of different colors on upper and lower surfaces in graduating tones from a light belly to a darker back, is common in the sea and on land.
