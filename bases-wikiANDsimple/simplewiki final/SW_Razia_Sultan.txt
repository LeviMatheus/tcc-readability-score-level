Razia al-Din or Razia Sultana (1205-1240) was one of the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate. She was the first and last Muslim lady to rule Delhi. She was said to be a brave, kind and just person. She ascended the throne in 1236 A.D. But the nobles who did not like to be ruled by Razia soon killed her in a war.
