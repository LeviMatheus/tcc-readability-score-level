Fred and George Weasley are characters in J.K. Rowling's "Harry Potter" series. They are twins and brothers of Harry Potter's best friend Ron Weasley; younger than Bill, Charlie, and Percy, but older than Ginny and Ron. They're basically in the middle of the seven Weasley children. Both are tall and skinny, have red hair, and are proud to be Weasleys.
Although these two aren't very big characters in the seven-book installment, they play some big roles in a few books. In "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", the twins show Harry the Marauder's Map that they found that leads to many useful and helpful things. In "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix" (their seventh year), the two escape Hogwarts and the horribly terrible new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, Professor Umbridge. Fred and George are also involved in Harry's big study group that is called D.A. (Dumbledore's Army). In the beginning of Half-Blood Prince, Ron, Hermione, and Harry, followed by Ginny, Mrs. and Mr. Weasley, visit the twins in their new joke shop. They are excited to see them and show all their new joke shop supplies. In "Deathly Hallows", Fred Weasley gets killed by an explosion presumably by Augustus Rookwood. George gets his ear cut off.
Fred and George are usually described as determined, mischievous, and very sneaky. They get scolded by their mother, Molly Weasley for many things that the boys do.(For example, Apparating right in front of her eyes in Order of the Phoenix.)
