A fox is a small mammal. There are 27 species of foxes, they are omnivorous (they eat both plants and animals) and the smallest members of the family Canidae (mammals related to dogs). They are swift and agile runners. A female fox may be called a vixen.
Foxes are found throughout all continents (except Antarctica), inhabiting mostly forest, shrub land, and desert regions. Most foxes feed on mice, voles, rabbits, birdsâ€™ eggs, fruit, large insects, and carrion. In the United Kingdom, it was a common sport for people to hunt foxes with horses and dogs.
