Edward V (4 November 1470 â€“ 1483?) was the King of England from 9 April 1483 until he was removed two months later, on 25 June 1483. His uncle, Richard III replaced him. Edward died in the Tower of London some time afterwards, and the cause of his death is still a mystery today, but he was probably murdered, along with his brother Richard.
