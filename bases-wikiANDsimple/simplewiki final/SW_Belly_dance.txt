A belly dance is a Middle Eastern type of dancing. In the Arabic language, it is called raqs sharqi (رقص شرقي, which means "oriental dance"). Many boys and girls in countries where belly dancing is popular will learn how to do it when they are young. The dance involves movement of many different parts of the body; usually in a circular way.
