Spirituality is a name given to matters of the spirit. Some people use this word instead of religion, while others see a difference.
Matters of the Spirit.
"Matters of the spirit" may include the meaning in a person's life (or in all life), and how to find and improve on it. They may also include someone's search for God, the supernatural, a divine influence in their lives, or information about the afterlife, and how to best deal with each. They may include how to live among others, or as a group, or in a certain environment.
Atheism.
Some people who do not believe in a religion may still be interested in the "spirits" of humanity or of nature, and live a certain way, or pay homage to ancestors or creation, because it helps their morale, or improves their happiness to do so.
Many philosophers try to find answers to spiritual questions, although they say that there is no god or anything supernatural.
