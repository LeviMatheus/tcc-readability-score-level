A sign is something that tells someone what to do, or shows them something. For example, the stop sign on the road tells the person that they must stop their car there.
A sign does not alway tell something directly. For example, a pain in a persons head can be a sign that they are sick. Felling a cold wind could be a sign that someone left a door or window open.
Road signs.
A road sign or traffic sign is something that gives information in only 1 or 2 words. It helps people in their vehicles on the road. Some signs include: Give way, Stop, Keep left, No U-turn, no parking, Zebra crossing and much more. Signs are very useful.
