185 Eunike is a dark and very big Main belt asteroid. It is made of carbonates.
It was found by C. H. F. Peters on March 1, 1878 in Clinton, New York and named after Eunike, a Nereid in Greek mythology whose name means 'happy victory'. The name was chosen to celebrate the Treaty of San Stefano (1878).
There have been three seen occultations of stars by Eunike.
