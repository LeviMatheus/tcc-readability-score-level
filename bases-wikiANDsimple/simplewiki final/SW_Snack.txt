A snack is a kind of food. It is usually small in size, and can be any kind of food that you do not eat in large amount. Because it is not meant to be a meal, a snack is not breakfast, lunch or dinner. People eat snacks if they are hungry between meals. For example, eating potato chips after lunch but before dinner is eating a snack. Snacks are easy to eat and portable, in most cases. Examples of snacks are: Mars, Snickers, Bounty and Twix. These are made of chocolate and with a different filling. If you eat a snack it will give you energy which usually comes from the large amounts of sugar and/or fat in the food, so eating snacks is good for you, most of the time. We need the energy from the food because we loose energy:walking, enduring in sport and even concentrating.
