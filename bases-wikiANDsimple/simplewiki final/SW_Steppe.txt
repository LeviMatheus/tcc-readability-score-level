In physical geography, a steppe is a plain without trees (apart from those near rivers and lakes); it is similar to a prairie, although a prairie is generally considered as being dominated by tall grasses, while short grasses are said to be the norm in the steppe. The world's largest steppe, sometimes called The Great Steppe, is in Russia. Another large steppe area is located in the central United States and western Canada.
It may be semi-desert, or covered with grass or shrubs or both, depending on the season and latitude. The term is also means the sort of climate that is to be found in regions too dry for a forest, but not so dry that there are only deserts. The soil is too moist for a desert, but too dry for normal forest life.
