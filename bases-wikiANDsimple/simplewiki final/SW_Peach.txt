Peach is a tree that at first grew in China. Peaches are also the fruit the peach tree makes. Peaches are called stone fruits because they have a shell of hard wood around their seed, called a stone or a pit. Cherries, plums, and apricots are other stone fruits. There are two types of peaches: freestone and clingstone. Freestone peaches do not stick to their pits, while clingstone peaches do.
The skin of a peach is an orange-yellow color, and it is covered in small, fine hairs called peach fuzz. A peach without the fuzz is commonly called a nectarine. The inside of a peach is a golden color. The inside of a peach is sweet and sticky. Because they taste sweet, peaches are often part of dessert.
Many North Americans enjoy this fruit, as well as others all over the world.
