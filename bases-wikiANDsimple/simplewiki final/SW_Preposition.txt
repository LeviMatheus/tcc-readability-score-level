Prepositions are words or word groups which begin a noun phrase with more than one word. Most prepositions tell where or when, or show possession.
Prepositions like "in", "beside", "above", and "out of" all tell "where", and are usually used with nouns or pronouns. Some examples with the phrases underlined: "The man sat "close to" his wife. He put his arm "around" her shoulder. Then he kissed her "on" the cheek."
Prepositions like "right after", "until", "during", and "before" all tell "when". "Mr. Prasad had an important meeting "until" ten o'clock. "During" the meeting, his cell phone rang. It was his wife. She asked him to come straight home "right after" work."
The prepositions "of" and "to" are used to show possession, or "belonging-to": "This book belongs "to Vlad." The cover "of the book" is torn."
