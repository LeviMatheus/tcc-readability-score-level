Rete testis is a network of small tubules found in the part of the testicle that carries sperm. They can sometimes get cysts.
Purpose.
The rete testis have concentrated sperm and fluid in them, and they help the epididymis to absorb this fluid. If the fluid is not absorbed, the person can be infertile.
