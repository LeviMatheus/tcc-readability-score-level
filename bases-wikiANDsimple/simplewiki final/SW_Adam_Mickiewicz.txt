Adam Bernard Mickiewicz (December 24, 1798 – November 26, 1855) was a heavily influential national Polish Romantic poet, generally regarded as the greatest figure in Polish literature, especially known for his epic poem "Pan Tadeusz". At the later phase of his life he was also a political activist, an ideologue and a messianist philosopher who lectured at Collège de France.
In many literary critics' opinion, Mickiewicz is among the most important writers such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, George Byron and Homer.
