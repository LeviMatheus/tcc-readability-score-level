Hedda (Hedvig Katarina) Hjortsberg, (1777-1867), was a Swedish ballerina. She was the sister of the famous Swedish actor Lars Hjortsberg, and was considered the greatest Swedish ballet-dancer of her generation.
She became a student of the French ballet-master Louis Gallodier in 1786, at the age of nine, and when she graduated, she was considered as one of the first great products of the newly founded Royal Swedish ballet.
Between 1791 and 1806 she was a premier-dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm. The writer Marianne Ehrenström called her the darling of the audience, and describes her as gracious as a nymph.
She danced the parts of Lucile in the pantomime ballet "Det dubbla giftermålet" by Jean Marcadet with Margaretha Christina Hallongren, Carl Dahlén, Raimond and Carlo Caspare Simone Uttini the season of 1790-1719, Leonore in "Enleveringen" by Louis Deland with honom, Hallongren, Uttini, Luigi Taglioni and Ambrosiani and Diana in "Diana och Kärleken" by Deland with J.F. Björkstrand, Deland, Hallongren, Casagli and Hedvig Elisabeth Casagli in 1800-1801; she also did the part of Venus in "Venus och Adonis" by Deland with H. Björkman, Casagli, G.B. Ambrosiani and Hallongren 1801-1802, and as Frosine in "Dansvurmen" by Gardel with Deland, Filippo Taglioni, Anna Christina Löfborg, Anders Ekholm, Raimond and Ambrosiani in 1803-1804.
When the Opera was opened again in 1809 after it had been closed since 1806, she performed with her five year old daughter in the ballet "Dansvurmen".
Hjortsberg married the businessman Erik Samuel Koersner in 1804, and Abraham Hülphers in 1811, and after that, she danced only as a guest-artist.
