Robert Banks Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool (June 7, 1770 â€“ December 4, 1828) was an English politician and the longest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Robert Walpole held office for longer, but not all people agree about when he became "Prime Minister".) During his time as Prime Minister from 1812 to 1827, Liverpool became known for hard rules he put in place to restore order, but he also led the country through the bad period that followed the Napoleonic Wars. Important events during his time as Prime Minister included the Congress of Vienna, the Corn Laws, Catholic emancipation and the Peterloo Massacre.
