Totalitarianism is a word used to describe modern regimes (political systems) where the government controls every part of public and private behavior, including the way that people think. It involves extreme collectivization (that of the mind included) and the personal becomes the political. This idea was mainly used in The Soviet Union.
It often involves mass participation in events such as parades or rallies.
