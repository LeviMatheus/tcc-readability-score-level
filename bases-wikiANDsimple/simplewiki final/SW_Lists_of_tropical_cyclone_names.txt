North Atlantic.
North Atlantic Ocean storms are named by the U.S. National Hurricane Center from the following lists. There are six lists of names, with female names starting odd-numbered years (e.g. 1999) and male names starting even-numbered years (e.g. 2002). Names are used in alphabetical order, and lists are recycled after six years. For retired names, see list of retired Atlantic hurricanes.
