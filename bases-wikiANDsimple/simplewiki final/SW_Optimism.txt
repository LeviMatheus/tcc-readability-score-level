Optimism is a philosophy and a way of life. Optimists believe that the world is generally a positive place to be in. In the view of an optimist, people and things are good. In their view, things will work out in the end.
The opposing theory is called pessimism. Gottfried Leibnitz was a famous optimist. Arthur Schopenhauer is often considered to be a famous pessimist.
Optimism is associated with the idea of a glass looking "half full", instead of looking "Half empty".
