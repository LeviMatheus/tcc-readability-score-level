There are several political parties in Germany.
Historical.
The oldest party in Germany is the Social Democratic Party (SPD).
There were a lot of parties in Germany at the time of the Weimar Republic. The only party which still exists today from that time is the SPD.
The others were Zentrum (the Centre Party), a conservative catholic, a liberal party, the Nazi party, the Communist Party (KPD), and others.
In the Nazi years, there was only the Nazi party. Other parties were banned by law.
Under Communism, East Germany had one leading party (the Socialist Unity Party, SED) and some smaller parties. The smaller parties had to accept the leading role of the SED.
Current situation.
Today there are many political parties in Germany, but only a few hold influence, because only a party which has at least 5 % of the vote (or which wins 3 direct seats) is represented in the Bundestag, Germany's federal parliament.
