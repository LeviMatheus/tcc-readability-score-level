Takama-ga-hara (Japanese: 高天原), literally "High Heaven's Plain" but usually translated as the "High Plain of Heaven," is a place in Japanese mythology. In Shinto, Takama-ga-hara is the place where the Kami live. The legend say it's connected to the Earth by the bridge "Ama-no uki-hashi" (the "Floating Bridge of Heaven"). In Shinto, when a kami is worshipped, it is invited to leave Takama-ga-hara and enter a shrine.
