The UEFA Champions League is a football competition between the best club teams in Europe. The teams are selected because of good performances in league matches. The teams used to have to win their countries' championship, but now more teams can qualify. Teams that have good performances but not good enough to qualify for the Champions League go to the UEFA Cup.
Manchester United F.C. are the current holders. They beat Chelsea F.C. in the 2007/2008 Champions League finals on penalties
