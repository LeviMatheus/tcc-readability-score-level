107 Camilla is one of the biggest main belt asteroids. It orbits within the Cybele Group, beyond most of the main belt asteroids. It has a very dark surface and is made of carbonate. It was found by N. R. Pogson on November 17, 1868 and named after Camilla, Queen of the Volsci in Roman mythology.
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Camilla's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+51°, 72°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives it an axial tilt of 29°.
Moon (S/2001 (107) I).
On March 1, 2001, a moon of Camilla was found by A. Storrs, F. Vilas, R. Landis, E. Wells, C. Woods, B. Zellner, and M. Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope. It has been designated S/2001 (107) 1 but it does not yet have an official name.
Later sightings in September 2005 with the VLT allowed the determination of an orbit. Apart from data in infobox, the inclination was found to be 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards (β, λ) = (+55°, 75°). Given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla, one can say that the orbit's inclination is less than 10°.
The moon is estimated to measure about 11 km in diameter. Assuming a similar density to the Camilla, this would give it a mass of about ~1.5 kg. It has a similar colour to Camilla.
