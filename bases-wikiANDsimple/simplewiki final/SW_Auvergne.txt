Auvergne is a region of France. It is in the center of the country. Its capital is Clermont-Ferrand. It is among the least populated ones. 1.3 million people live there. 141.000 of them in Clermont-Ferrand.
As with other relatively-poor regions in France, the Auvergne now has a substantial - and growing - English population. Whilst some argue that this has had a detrimental effect on house prices, the English speaking community has invested millions of euros in local businesses (especially in the building sector) and has allowed the creation of a number of small (English speaking) businesses.
