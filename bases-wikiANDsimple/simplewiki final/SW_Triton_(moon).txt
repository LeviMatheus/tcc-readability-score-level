Triton "(trye'-tən,", Greek "Τρίτων)," or Neptune I, is the planet Neptune's largest moon and the seventh largest moon in the Solar System. Triton has a complicated geological history and it is thought to have a comparatively young surface compared to the age of the solar system itself. It was discovered by British astronomer William Lassell on October 10 1846, just 17 days after Neptune itself was discovered by German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. It is also believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt object, and is the coldest known body in the Solar System.
Triton is also falling into a lowering orbit. In about one billion years, Triton is calculated that it will either collide into Neptune's atmosphere, or break up into ring systems similar to those patterns of Saturn's.
