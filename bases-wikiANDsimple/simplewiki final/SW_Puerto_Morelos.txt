There are two parts to Puerto Morelos, the original coastal fishing village is now a laid-back, mixed use neighborhood of private homes, hotels, condominiums, restaurants, and tourist shops. The second part about 2 km. inland and adjacent to Highway 307, on the western side. The inland portion is mainly single level dwellings for the local workers.
