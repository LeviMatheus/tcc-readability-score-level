A drug is any biological substance that is not taken for dietary needs. Some drugs are taken for illnesses and some are taken for fun. Usually a doctor will give someone a drug for an illness to make them well. People take drugs for fun because they affect the body or brain in different ways. Drugs that are taken for fun are called "recreational" and drugs for illnesses are called "therapeutic".
Drugs may have bad effects as well as the good effect - these bad effects are called side-effects.
Drugs need to be taken in the right amount. The amount of the drug taken is called a dose. Taking too much of a drug can cause sickness or even death. When a doctor says how much of a drug (the right dose) to take, only that amount should be taken. It is very important to keep taking the drug until the doctor says to stop because someone can feel better and still be sick. When a doctor says what drug to take, how much of it, and for how long, it is called a prescription. Drugs may cause addiction. Some drugs are illegal because they are very addictive. These drugs are really expensive, too.
Recreational drugs.
Certain recreational drugs also have uses as a therapeutic drug; that way, Heroin can be used as an analgesic (a painkiller). Recreational drugs can be dangerous, certain countries have made it illegal to have or take them outside a medical context. This is because they can be addictive, most of the time. That way, Cannabis-based products are legal in the Netherlands, but illegal in many other countries. Alcohol and Nicotine are legal almost everywhere, but there are a lot of taxes on the sale of these. In other words, they are expensive to buy. In some cases, not everyone is allowed to buy them; people often need to have a minimal age to do so.
