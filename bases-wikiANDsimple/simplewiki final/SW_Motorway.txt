A motorway is a word used in the United Kingdom, New Zealand, some other Commonwealth nations, and Ireland for a fast road, with four lanes or more. It is used to carry many cars. A Motorway has no traffic-lights or ground level intersections. All roads crossing the motorway go over a bridge or a tunnel. Places where cars can leave or enter the motorway are called exits.
