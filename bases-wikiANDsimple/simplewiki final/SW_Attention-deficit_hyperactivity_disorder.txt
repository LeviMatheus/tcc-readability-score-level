Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a kind of illness. It affects the nerves. It changes how people develop, it is called "neurological developental disorder". About 3-5 % of the people worldwide are affected.
A review of 102 studies estimated ADHD's worldwide prevalence in people under the age of 19 to be 5.29%. This figure varied widely, though, mainly because different studies used different methods and criteria. There also seem to be geographical differences. There are more cases in North America, than there are in Africa and the Middle East. 10% of males, and (only) 4% of females have been diagnosed in the U.S. Either males are more likely to get ADHD, or that females with ADHD are less likely to be diagnosed.
People with ADHD have problems with concentration, and focusing on a task for a long time. They may also be hyperactive.
ADHD is most often diagnosed in children. Since 1978, it has been also been diagnosed in adults more often. About 60% of children diagnosed with ADHD also have the condition as adults. ADHD appears to be highly heritable. About one-fifth of all cases are estimated to be caused from trauma or being exposed to toxins. Treatment is usually with a combination of medications, behavior modifications, life style changes, and counseling.
