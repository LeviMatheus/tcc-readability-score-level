A eukaryote (juːˌkarɪəʊt), also spelled eucaryote, is an organism with complex cells. In those cells the genetic material is organized into membrane-bound nuclei. Eukaryotes are formed of animals, plants, and fungi — which are mostly multicellular. There are also various other groups that are collectively classified as protists. Many protists are unicellular organisms.
In contrast, other organisms, such as bacteria, do not have nuclei and other complex cell structures. Such organisms are called prokaryotes. The eukaryotes share a common origin, and are often treated formally as a superkingdom, empire, or domain. The name comes from the Greek "eu" (meaning "good") and "karyon" (meaning "nut"). The "nut" is a reference to the cell nucleus.
Structure.
Eukaryotic cells are almost always much bigger than prokaryotes, usually one eukaryotic cell is up to 1000 times bigger than a prokaryote. Eucrayotic cells have many internal membranes and structures, called organelles. They also have a cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is made up of microtubules and microfilaments. Those parts are very important in the cell's organization. Eukaryotic DNA is divided into several bundles called chromosomes, which are separated by a microtubular spindle during nuclear division. Most eukaryotes have some sort of reproduction through cell fusion, which prokaryotes don't use. The eukaryotes aren't male or female, so they have no sex, also called being asexual.
