Cassandra "Cassie" is a fictional character in the television series "Skins". She is played by Hannah Murray.
Characterisation.
Cassie is shown as a very complicated character. She appears to suffer from anorexia nervosa, bulimia, self harm, drug addiction and low self esteem. Her entire self worth is dependent on her weight, in one episode saying "I didn't eat for three days... so I could be lovely." In the pilot, "Tony" she displays obsessive-compulsive tendencies in her need to sort food and also described as having "an interesting relationship with food."
Despite all of her "problems", she is a very compassionate, loving person. In her Myspace-style "about me" section of the "Skins" website she goes into detail in describing how much she loves her baby brother Reuben. She will even react positively to bad news so as not to offend. Like her close friend Jal Fazer, she is highly intelligent, sharing her understanding of Pythagorean triples.
