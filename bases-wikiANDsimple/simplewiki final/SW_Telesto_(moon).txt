Telesto is a tiny moon of Saturn. It was discovered by a number of astronomers in 1980, based from some observations from the Earth. It was named after Telesto in Greek mythology. Telesto orbits around Saturn together with much larger moon Tethys. Thus, Telesto is also known as a Trojan moon. The moon leads at a point 60 degrees in front of Tethys in its orbit. Another small moon, Calypso, orbits with Telesto.
