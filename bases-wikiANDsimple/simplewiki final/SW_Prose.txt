Prose is writing without regular rhythm and is very similar to everyday communication. That makes the most important difference to poetry.
The word prose comes from the Latin "prosa", meaning straightforward, hence the term "prosaic," which is often seen as negative. Prose writing is usually adopted for the description of facts or the discussion of whatever one's thoughts are, incorporated in free flowing speech. It may be used for newspapers, caper stories, magazines, encyclopedias, broadcast media, movies, letters, debtor's notes, famous quotes, murder mystery, history, philosophy, biography, linguistic geography and many other forms of media.
Prose generally has no formal structure like meter or rhyme that is often found in poetry. Although some works of prose may happen to contain traces of metrical structure or versification, a conscious blend of the two forms of literature is known as a prose poem.
