The House of Lords is one of the two Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom (UK). It is in London, the capital city of the UK. The other house is the House of Commons. Together the two houses form the government and parliament of the UK. At the moment the House of Lords is not elected (voted for), but there are plans that this might change soon.
