An interactive whiteboard is the modern version of the traditional boards we all know from school. A large interactive display is connected to a computer and a projector. The beamer projects the computers desktop onto the white flat. The user can control the computer by using a pen, finger or another tool. Normally the whiteboard is fixed on a wall but you can also find some mobile interactive whiteboards.They are used in different settings such as in classrooms at all level of educations, in work groups and training rooms for professional coaching for example sport coaching.

Resources for an interactive whiteboard.
The amount of resources for an interactive whiteboard can split into two different parts.
Teachers and students can use the board.
Different projections.
There are different kind of projections. But for all systems you can find pros and cons.
In this system the beamer is placed in front of the whiteboard. Either the beamer is fixed on the whiteboard or it hangs on the ceiling.
Compared to the rear projection this system is much cheaper â€“ this is the pros.
The cons is that the teacher or the student must stand in front of the whiteboard and sometimes their body will cast a shadow.
In the rear-projection system the beamer is placed behind the whiteboard. This leads to the pros of this system because the teacher does not cast a shadow and does not look into the beamer light while speaking to the students.
The cons is that this system is very expensive.
