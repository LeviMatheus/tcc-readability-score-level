A Kite is a flying object that is attached to the ground by a rope, or ropes. Kites can be flown for fun, or in competitions.
History.
The kite was created in China, about 2,800 years ago. Later it spread into other Asian countries, like Japan and Korea. However, the kite only appeared in Europe by about the year 1600.
The first kites had sails made of paper or light fabrics such as silk. The poles were made from bamboo, or other strong but flexible woods, and the kite line was made from string or twine.
Modern kites are made from synthetic materials, such as ripstop nylon or more exotic fabrics on the sails. They have fiberglass or carbon fiber poles, and use dacron or dyneema for the kite lines.
Today there are many different types of kite. Some are large and are made to look good, but some are smaller and are made for speed and competitions.
