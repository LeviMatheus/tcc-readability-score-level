Addington is a village in the London Borough of Croydon in south London. Addington is home to many historical sites in Croydon, like Croydon Palace and the Addington Palace. St Mary's Church is also in Addington and is known for the cross commemorating five archbishops in the foreground. Before the tram system was introduced in 2000 connections to the town were very short with only a few buses to Croydon.
The reputation of Addington is not good. People see it as run down and not very nice, meaning that a lot of people from elsewhere in London try to avoid it. New Addington is a town close by to Addington. Once there was only one school in the village and all the children went to it, now that school has been demolished.
