A piece of hail (called a hailstone) is a lump of ice that falls out of a storm cloud. Because the air in clouds is colder than the air near the ground, hail can fall in the middle of summer. Hail usually falls during thunderstorms. Hailstones are usually smaller than peas, but sometimes get as big as tennis balls. Strong hailstorms can damage houses and cars, and even hurt people.
