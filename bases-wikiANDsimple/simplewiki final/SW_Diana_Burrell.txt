Diana Burrell (born Norwich 25 October 1948) is an English composer. She went to Norwich High School for Girls and then studied music at the University of Cambridge. She started her career as a viola player, but soon she started to become well-known for her compositions and became a full-time composer.
Her first big orchestral piece was called "Landscape" (1988). It describes the wild, windswept countryside. Another orchestral work has a long title in German: "Das Meer so gross und weit ist da wimmelts ohne Zahlgrosse kleine Tiere" ("The Sea is so big and wide and swarming with numerous little animals"). It describes the sounds and the atmosphere of the sea.
Diana has written other orchestral works including concertos for viola, flute and clarinet, an opera "The Albatross" (1997), lots of choral works and chamber music. She likes modern architecture and her music sometimes shows this in the way it is shaped. She has also written music for young people such as "Lights and Shadows" (1989) which includes childrenâ€™s choir, recorder group and lots of percussion.
Diana teaches at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and is Artistic Director of Spitalfields Festival in London. She lives in East London.
