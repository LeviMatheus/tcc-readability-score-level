Wikia is a website where people can make a wiki. Wikia was made in 2004 by Jimmy Wales (the man who made Wikipedia) and Angela Beesley. It used to be called Wikicities, and the name was changed to Wikia on March 27 2006.
Wikis on Wikia must be about something which lots of people will like, so people cannot make them on any topic. All content on Wikia is released under a free license, such as the GNU Free Documentation License or the Creative Commons. Anybody can change pages on wikis at Wikia, so that no single person "owns" or is "the boss" of a wiki, and so that large communities can be made. The software used is Mediawiki.
Wikia uses Google ads to generate money.
