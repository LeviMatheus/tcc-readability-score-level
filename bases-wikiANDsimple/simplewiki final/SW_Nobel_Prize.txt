Every year, prizes called Nobel Prizes are given to people who have done very well in different areas. These areas include Literature, Science and Peace. The Nobel Prize was named after Alfred Nobel. For many people, winning a Nobel Prize is a very special thing in their lives.
Prize categories and winners.
The Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, sometimes called the "Nobel Prize in Economics", was not a part of Nobel's will. It was started in 1969 by Sveriges Riksbank, the Bank of Sweden. Since this prize was not in Nobel's will, and is not paid for by his money, it is not a Nobel Prize. However, it is awarded together with the other Nobel prizes.
