Alliteration is when a sentence or phrase has many words starting with the same letter. It is commonly used in advertising, poetry, headlines, and tongue-twisters.
An example of alliteration is "Sally sold sea shells so she should sleep soundly so so so so sweet", and "Sally sold sea shells down by the sea shore".
