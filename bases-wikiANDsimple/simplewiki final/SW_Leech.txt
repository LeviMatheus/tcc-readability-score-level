Leeches are annelids, a kind of worm (ground creature) that lives in wet places. All leeches are carnivorous, that is, they eat mainly meat, but some are also haemophagic parasitic; this means they drink the blood of other animals. They are sometimes helpful in medicine. They are often used to reduce blood clots.
