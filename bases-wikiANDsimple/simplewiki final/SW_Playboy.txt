"Playboy" is a magazine mostly for men. It was founded and run by Hugh Hefner in 1953.
The magazine is published once every month. It has photographs of nude women. It also has some articles on fashion, sports, consumer goods, and public figures. Very often, short fiction by top literary writers, such as Arthur C. Clarke is there too. The magazine has been known to express liberal opinions on most major political subjects.
"Playboy's" use of "tasteful" nude photos is often classified as “softcore” in contrast to the more “hardcore” pornographic magazines that started to appear in the 1970s in response to the success of "Playboys more explicit rival, "Penthouse".
Many women dislike Playboy because they feel it cheapens them and makes them into things to be looked at. Other women enjoy its articles and reading about what men like. Still others find Playboy funny.
