Scrooge McDuck or Uncle Scrooge is a fictional character first appearing in the comic book "Christmas on Bear Mountain". The character was created by Carl Barks and has appeared in many comic books, television shows, films, and video games. Since 1952 Scrooge McDuck has appeared in his own comic book series, called "Uncle Scrooge".
Scrooge was born in Scotland in 1867, the son of Fergus McDuck. His family is very poor, so Scrooge emigrates to USA where he finds gold and becomes rich. In 1902 he moves to Duckburg and builds the Money Bin on Killmotor Hill in the center of Duckburg. Over the next years, Scrooge travels the world, learning about many cultures. In 1930, Scrooge became the richest duck on Earth.
In 1942, Scrooge retires and buys a mansion called the Manor McDuck. In 1947, he invites his nephew Donald Duck and his grand-nephews Huey, Dewey and Louie to spend Christmas at his mansion. A criminal gang called the Beagle Boys keep trying to steal Scrooge's money.
