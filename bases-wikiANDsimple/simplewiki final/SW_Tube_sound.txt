Tube sound (or valve sound) is the sound produced by a vacuum tube-based audio amplifier. All amplifiers distort to some degree; some audiophiles prefer the sound produced by tube-based amplifiers. The reasons for the difference in sound between tube and solid state electronic devices is a continuing debate among audiophiles.
