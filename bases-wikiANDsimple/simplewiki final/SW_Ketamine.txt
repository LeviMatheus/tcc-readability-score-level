Ketamine is an anesthetic. It causes a so called dissociative analgesia, which means that it has a high analgesic effect but a minor hypnotic, so treated people can be nearly awake but without feeling pain. Sometimes it can lead to hallucinations. That is why some people use it as a recreational drug. As it can have severe side effects, it is usually not available as an over-the-counter drug. For many years Ketamine had been available just as an racemic mixture (S and R-Ketamine in equal molarities). The new Enantiomer Esketamin has much fewer of these side effects.
A prescription is needed to get it (too).
