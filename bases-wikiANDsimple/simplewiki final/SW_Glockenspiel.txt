The glockenspiel is a type of percussion instrument. It is in the same category of musical instruments as the xylophone and timpani. A Glockenspiel usually has a range of two and a half octaves. It is set up in a keyboard format, similar to the xylophone. Unlike the wooden xylophone, the glockenspiel is a metallophone. It is made of metal. The glockenspiel is played by hitting it with mallets with a plastic or felt tip. It has a soft sound, but it is very high pitch. If it is hit too hard, it makes a very bad sound. It is often used to represent things such as fairies, birds, and butterflies. The glockenspiel is from Germany.
