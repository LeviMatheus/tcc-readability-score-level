Water vapor is water that is in the form of a vapor, or gas. It is a part of the water cycle. When liquid water is heated to boiling temperature, 100 degrees Celsius, it all turns into vapor. Water vapor can also be produced directly from ice; this is called sublimation. Clouds and steam are both water vapor. Water vapor affects weather conditions.
Water vapor weighs less than air, which is part of the reason clouds float high in the sky.
Water vapor is transparent. The small droplets looks white, like mist.
