The Colorado potato beetle is called "Leptinotarsa decemlineata" by biologists. It is a kind of beetle.
The Colorado potato beetle first lived in North America, in the southern United States and northern Mexico. Now it lives in most of North America and also in Europe and Asia.
What it eats.
The Colorado potato beetle eats potato plants. There can be so many Colorado potato beetles in potato farms that they kill the potatoes. Many farmers use pesticides to kill Colorado potato beetles.
The Colorado potato beetle did not always eat potatoes. This is because potatoes came from South America, not North America where the beetle was. Before people brought potatoes to North America, the Colorado potato beetle ate a plant called buffalo-bur.
