The F/A-18 Hornet (CF-18, F-18) is a fighter jet that is made by Boeing, and was originally manufactured by the McDonnell-Douglas Company. It first flew in 1978 and was introduced in 1983. Its main user is the United States Navy. It can fly off of a type of boat called an "Aircraft carrier", because of its special design. The F/A-18 can attack land and air targets, something that is called "multi-role". The Hornet is also flown by the Blue Angels.
