"K-9 and Company" was a 1981 television spin-off of the original series of "Doctor Who". It featured Sarah Jane Smith, played by Elisabeth Sladen, and K-9, a robotic dog. Both characters had been companions of the Fourth Doctor, but they had not appeared together before. A single episode, "A Girl's Best Friend", was produced, but the series was not taken up.
