A light microscope works a lot like a refracting telescope except that the object is very close to the objective lens. Put a tiny organism (a "daphnia" or water flea) found in pond water on a glass slide. The clips on the microscope's flat stage hold the slide in place. Now take a look through the microscope eyepiece. A mirror at the bottom of the microscope reflects light rays up to the daphnia through a hole in the stage. Objective lenses magnify the image which is made even larger when it is seen through the eyepiece lenses.
The light microscope is widely used in colleges and high schools. It normally has a top magnification of 40x with the option of having 4x and 8x. This lets the microscope have the ability to see basic cells and other items.
