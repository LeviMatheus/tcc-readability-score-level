William III of England (14 November 1650 - 8 March 1702) was King of England and King of Ireland from 13 February 1689, and King of Scots from 11 April 1689. In all these three cases, he remained the king until his death on 8th March 1702.
William was born in the Netherlands. His mother was Mary Stuart. Mary was the sister to the King of England, James II. This meant that King James was William's uncle. The people of England did not like King James. They made a revolution in 1688. This forced King James to run away from London. William then became the new King of England.
William's enemy was the King of France, Louis XIV. William helped to stop Louis from conquering the whole of Europe.
