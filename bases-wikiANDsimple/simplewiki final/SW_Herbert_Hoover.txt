Herbert Clark Hoover (August 10, 1874 – October 20, 1964), the 31st president of the United States from 1929–1933. He was a world-famous mining engineer and humanitarian administrator. As a United States Commerce Secretary in the 1920s under Presidents Warren G. Harding and Calvin Coolidge, he promoted economic modernization. In the presidential election of 1928, Hoover easily won the Republican nomination. The nation was prosperous and optimistic, leading to a landslide for Hoover over the Democrat Al Smith.
Hoover deeply believed in the Efficiency Movement. He argued that there were technical solutions to all social and economic problems. That position hard to have because of the Great Depression, which began in 1929, the first year of his presidency. He tried hard to end the depression with many new programs, such as the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. But none of them worked, since he and Congress failed to learn of the bad effects of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. The consensus among historians is that Hoover's defeat in the 1932 election was caused mostly by failure to end the stop deep depression, compounded by popular opposition to prohibition, Hoover's lack of charisma in relating to voters, and his poor skills in working with politicians.
