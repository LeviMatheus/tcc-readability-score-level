Emperor Jimmu (January 1, 660 BC - March 11, 585 BC) was a legendary figure in the history of Japan. In myths, he is the founder of Japan and is also first in the traditional list of emperors. The royal family once based its claim to rule Japan because they are thought to be descended from, or related to him.
The name "Jimmu" means "god-warrior" or "divine might." This name was given after his death.
In Shinto belief, he is thought to be a descendant of the sun goddess Amaterasu.
According to that legend, she gave him 3 symbols of power: a jewel, a sword and a mirror.
Before Jimmu's apperance, there was havoc in Japan. There was no united law or leadership, but several villages making their way alone. The first emperor united these groups and set up a system, with the old leaders as his samurai, or political leaders, and as shogun, the military powers.
Names.
His personal name was "Kamuyamato Iwarebiko", but it would not be considered polite to call an emperor by this name.
