The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland uses as its national flag the royal banner known as the "Union Flag" or, popularly, "Union Jack". The design today of the Union Flag comes from the union of Ireland and Great Britain in 1801. It has the red cross of Saint George (patron saint of England), edged in white, on top of the Cross of Saint Patrick (patron saint of Ireland), which are on the Saltire of Saint Andrew (patron saint of Scotland).
Its correct measurements are 1:2 (i.e. the bottom is twice as long as the sides). However, the version used by the British Army is 3:5, and two of the red diagonals are cropped.
Legacy.
The Union Jack has a legacy for flags, and most of the former colonies of Britain have this design on their own flags (i.e Australia, Fiji, Hawaii, some provinces of Canada, etc).
