Poitiers is a town on the Clain River in west central France. It is the capital ("pr√©fecture") of the Vienne "department" and of the Poitou-Charentes "region". The town is picturesque; and its streets are interesting for their remains of ancient architecture, especially of the Romanesque period, and the memories of great historical events. About 86.000 people live in Poitiers.
The city itself is very old. It already existed as a Gaulish fort in the time when Julius Caesar came to Gaul. It was the capital of the tribe of the Pictones.
