"Fragile Future" is the third album by Hawthorne Heights. It was released in 2008. It was their first album without Casey Calvert, because he died in late 2007.
Hawthorne Heights didn't have a lot of success on the singles, but it was seen as a new start for the band.
While much of the album was inspired by things that had been happening to the band, it never says the words "Casey" or "Victory Records"
The album art includes a picture of Casey Calvert near a lamppost.
