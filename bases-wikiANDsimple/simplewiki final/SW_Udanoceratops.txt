Udanoceratops had a very large skull (1.5 times the size of the next largest protoceratopid Montanoceratops) with no nasal horn. It most resembles Leptoceratops but with larger nasal apertures, less teeth in the upper jaw and more in the lower jaw - there are also differences in its teeth and skull bones. It has a mixture of advanced and primitive features and may turn out to be a ceratopsid.
