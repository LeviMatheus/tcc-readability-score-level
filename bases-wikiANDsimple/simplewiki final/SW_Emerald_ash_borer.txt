The emerald ash borer ("Agrilus planipennis" or "Agrilus marcopoli" and EAB) is a shiny green beetle native to Asia. It made its way into the United States by accident and has since been spread to eleven states and of those areas that border with Canada. It has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America.
