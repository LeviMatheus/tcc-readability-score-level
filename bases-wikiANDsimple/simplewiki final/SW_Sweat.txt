Sweat is a liquid, mostly water (can contain body salts), that comes from the body when it is hot. It comes from pores in the skin. These pores are so small they can not be seen. Skin has a lot of pores. Sweat is salty.
Sweat comes out when the body is hot because it helps cool it down. The sweat takes the heat from the body when it evaporates (turns to gas).
Some people think sweat makes a person smell bad. Many people use special sprays to stop this from happening. Deodorants hide the odor of sweat. Anti-perspirants stop the body from sweating.
