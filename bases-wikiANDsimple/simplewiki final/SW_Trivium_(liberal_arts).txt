From the Latin, trivium ("tres": "three" and "v√≠a": "way", "way") is the set of three ways.
In the Antiquity and the Middle Ages, three of the seven liberal arts relatived to the eloquence: grammar, rhetoric and dialectics (or logic)
In the medieval universities, the trivium included the three basic aspects of the knowledge: The grammar as mechanics of the language; the logic (or dialectics - logic and dialectics became the words with the same meanings in the times) that is the "mechanics" of the thinking and the analysis; and the rhetoric that is the usage of the language in order to instruct and to persuade. In the medieval Scholasticism, they were considered camps preparing for the quadrivium which includes the arithmetic, the geometry, the music and the astronomy.
