The Convention People's Party (CPP) was a political party made by Kwame Nkrumah in 1949. It was formed as a split from the United Gold Coast Convention, which, before the forming of the CPP, Nkrumah became general secretary of in 1947. Nkrumah split from the UGCC because Nkrumah did not agree with the UGCC's beliefs and ways.. The party continues to exist today.
