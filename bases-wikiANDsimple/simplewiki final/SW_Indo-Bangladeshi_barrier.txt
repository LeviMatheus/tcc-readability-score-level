The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is a 4,000-kilometer fence that India is presently constructing to seal off the Indian-Bangladeshi international border from what was formerly East Bengal. East Bengal was a partitioned region of Bengal, belonging to East Pakistan from 1947 to 1971. This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from the rest of India by the end of 2012.
