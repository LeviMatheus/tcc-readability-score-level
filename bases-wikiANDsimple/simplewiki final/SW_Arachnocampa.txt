Arachnocampa is a family of flies. They are also called Fungus gnats. They occur in Australia and New Zealand. Their larvae are glowworms.
They were called Bolitphila ("mushroom-lovers") until 1924. Then people found out that their larvae use silk threads to catch prey. Their current name means "spider-grub".
