An artificial or constructed language (sometimes called a conlang) is a language that has been designed by a person or small group, rather than produced naturally as part of a culture. Some are designed for use in human communication (like the well-known Esperanto). Others are created for use in fiction, linguistic experiments, secret codes, or simply because the maker likes to play language games.
Constructed languages can be split into a priori languages, which are made from scratch, and a posteriori languages, which borrow words and grammar from existing languages.
Some constructed languages also have constructed scripts to write them.
