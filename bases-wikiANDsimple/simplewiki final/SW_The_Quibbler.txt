"The Quibbler" is a fictional magazine of the Harry Potter world.
"The Quibbler" is written by Xenophilius Lovegood, father of Luna Lovegood. The magazine are sensationalist and contains the strange opinions of Xenophilius.
For most of "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", "The Quibbler" writes positive views on Harry, and tells people to support him. However, after Luna is taken by the "Death Eaters" (supporters of Voldemort), Xenophilius turns against Harry and begins posting wanted signs for him in "The Quibbler". When Harry visits him for information on the deathly hallows, Xenophilius turns him in to the Death Eaters. Harry narrowly escapes.
