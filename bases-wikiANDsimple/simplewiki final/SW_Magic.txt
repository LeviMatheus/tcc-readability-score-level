Magic can mean many things. It can mean something that has no logical or scientific explanation (also called a miracle), or witchcraft (which people used to believe causes such things). Nowadays it usually refers to a trick performed by what is called "sleight of hand" meaning something not seen or noticed by the audience. Many stories have people who use real magic (not trick magic) in them. These people are called wizards.
A person who performs magic tricks is called a magician.
