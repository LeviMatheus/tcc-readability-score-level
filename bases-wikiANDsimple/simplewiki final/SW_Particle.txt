A particle is a very small piece of something. In science, a particle refers to the tiny pieces that make up atoms.
There are many different types of particles, all with different sizes.
The three largest particles are the proton, the neutron, and the electron. The proton has a positive charge (a + charge). The neutron has a neutral charge. The electron has a negative charge (a - charge), and it is the smallest out of these three particles. These three particles make up atoms, with protons located in the nucleus (or the center of the atom) with neutrons, and electrons orbiting the nucleus.
The next smallest particles are quarks. Quarks make up protons and neutrons. There are six different types of quarks. These are the up quark, the down quark, the strange quark, the charmed quark, the bottom quark, and the top quark. A neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark. The proton is made up of two up quarks and one down quark.
