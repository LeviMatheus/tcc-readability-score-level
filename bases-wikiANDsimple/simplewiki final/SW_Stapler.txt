A stapler is an office tool that is used to place thin items such as paper together. It uses a small metal device (a staple) to put them together. The ends of the staple are pointed and go into the paper. There is also a chain of stores called "Staples", which sell office supplies.
When you press the stapler down, it will release a staple and the staple is pressed into the into the paper, and then bent. That way the pieces of paper get stuck together.
