An orphanage (or children's home) is an institution which cares for children whose parents have died or have abandoned them. In English, such children are called orphans. Historically it was very often the church or the state who cared for orphans. Today, however, most orphanages are being turned into other services. The people who run those services very often try to place the children in a family that might adopt them.
