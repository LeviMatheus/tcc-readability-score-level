Related languages.
The Finnish grammar and most Finnish words are very different from those in other European languages, because Finnish is not an Indo-European language. The two other national languages that are Uralic languages as Finnish are Estonian and Hungarian. Estonian and Finnish are very close to each other, and Estonians and Finns usually may understand each other. Even though Finnish and Hungarian are related languages, they do not look or sound similar. The Finnish and Hungarian languages separated a long time ago, and each language developed its own vocabulary. People who can speak Finnish cannot understand Hungarian without extra study, and Hungarians cannot understand Finnish. However, there are some basic words that are very similar, for example: 'hand' (Finnish 'käsi' vs. Hungarian 'kéz') 'to go' (Finnish 'mennä' vs. Hungarian 'menni'), 'fish' (Finnish 'kala' vs. Hungarian 'hal'.
Finnish grammar.
Finnish is a synthetic and an agglutinative language. This means that words in Finnish have a stem called "body", and many parts inside them that make up meaning. Finnish is similar in this respect as Japanese language and Turkish language and Latin language. In Finnish there are 15 cases. A case is an ending added to a word that helps describe its purpose in the sentence.
