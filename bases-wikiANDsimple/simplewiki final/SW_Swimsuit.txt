A swimsuit (also "swimmers"), bathing suit (also "bathers"), aqua jammies or swimming costume (sometimes shortened to "cozzie") is clothing designed to be worn for swimming.
Swimming trunks are a pair of shorts or briefs worn for swimming or bathing.
In New Zealand English and some areas of Australian English, swimsuits are usually called togs. This term is less common in other parts of the Commonwealth where it can also refer to clothes in general. Swimsuits can be skin-tight or loosely fitting and range from garments designed to preserve as much modesty as possible to garments designed to reveal as much of the body as possible without actual nudity. They are often lined with a fabric that prevents them from becoming transparent when wet.
