June is the sixth month of the year; it has 30 days. June is named for the Roman goddess Juno, the wife of Jupiter, and she is goddess of marriage, so getting married in June was thought to be lucky. June begins on a different day of the week each year.
June's flower is the Rose and the birthstone is the pearl. The meaning for the birthstone pearl is health.
