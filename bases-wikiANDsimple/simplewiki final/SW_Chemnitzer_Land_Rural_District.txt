Chemnitzer Land is a district in the Free State of Saxony, Germany.
The district has a very big population because the East German government tried to make the area very industrial.
The district was created in 1994 by joining the old districts of Glauchau and Hohenstein-Ernstthal. In 2008, part of city of Zwickau will become part of the district. The rest of the city will become part of Zwickauer Land.
