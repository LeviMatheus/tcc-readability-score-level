The nation state is a certain form of state that has a territorium where mainly one nation lives. The state is a political entity; the nation is a cultural and/or ethnic entity. The term "nation-state" means that the two are on the same territorium, and this distinguishes the nation state from the other types of state, which existed before.
What states existed before nation-states?
In Europe, in the eighteenth century, the classic non-national states were the "multi-ethnic" empires, (the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, the French Empire, the British Empire).
