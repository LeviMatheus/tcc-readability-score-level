Alkaline earth elements are related to the Alkali metals, but they do not react this acute, because they need more energy to remove two electrons. So they do not have to be stored in petrol. As ions they have a charge of +2.The alkaline earth metals are silvered colored, soft metals, which react readily with halogens to form ionic salts, and with water, though not as rapidly as the alkali metals, to form strongly alkaline (basic) hydroxides.
