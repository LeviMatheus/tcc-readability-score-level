Brackish water (less commonly brack water) is salt and fresh water mixed together. It is saltier than fresh water, but not as salty as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers.
Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular certain civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farms.
Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30 grams of salt per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 parts per thousand (ppt or ‰). Thus, "brackish" covers a range of salinity regimes and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space and/or time.
Etymology.
The term brackish water comes from the Low German word "Brack", which is a small lake created when a storm tide breaks a dike and floods land behind the dike.
Estuaries.
An estuary is a body of water with fresh and salt water.The most important brackish water habitats are estuaries, where a river meets the sea. The River Thames flowing through London is one of the most familiar of river estuaries..
Mangroves.
Another important brackish water habitat is the mangrove swamp or mangal..
Brackish seas and lakes.
Some seas and lakes are brackish. The Baltic Sea is a brackish sea adjoining the North Sea..
The Caspian Sea is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal seawater. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the Caspian seal) and the great sturgeons, a major source of caviar.
