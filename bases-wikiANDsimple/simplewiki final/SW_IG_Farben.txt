IG Farben (short for Interessen-Gemeinschaft Farbenindustrie
AG), was a German conglomerate of companies formed in 1925- including BASF, AGFA and Hoechst- and even earlier during World War I. "Farben" is German for "paints", "dyes", or "colors", and initially many of these companies produced dyes, but soon began to embrace more advanced chemistry. The founding of IG Farben was a reaction to Germany's defeat in World War I. IG Farben held a near total monopoly on chemical production, later during the Nazi regime, including manufacturing Zyklon B.
