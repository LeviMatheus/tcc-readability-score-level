For ground propulsion the first instrument was the wheel.
For water propulsion it were pole, paddle, oar and sail. Nowadays the most common types are underwater propeller, water jet and paddle wheel. Sails are still common, and historically represented the most important form of early propulsion for large ships.
For air propulsion, the most common types are propeller, jet engine, turboprop, ramjet, rocket propulsion, and, experimentally, scramjet, pulse jet, and pulse detonation engine.
