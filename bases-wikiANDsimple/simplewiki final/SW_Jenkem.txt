Jenkem is an alleged drug that was supposedly invented in poor parts of Africa.
Appearence.
When it is ready to be used, it is a gas. It is created from feces left in a container to ferment for a long time
Effects.
When breathed in, Jenkem makes the person see crazy things. It is like a crazy dream, the person imagines things happening that are not really happening. The person may also hear sounds that are not relly there. This is called a hallucination. Jenkem is also used to make a person happy. Because it is made out of fermented waste (or old poop), it is also very stinky.
Dangers of using Jenkem.
Because Jenkem is human waste and is inhaled (huffing), the person can get a nasty infection because of the dirt and germs in the waste. It also leaves a nasty taste of poop in the mouth for days.
