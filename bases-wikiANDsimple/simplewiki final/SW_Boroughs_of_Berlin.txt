The German capital Berlin is subdivided into 12 boroughs (german: "Stadtteile"/ "Bezirke"). The boroughs are called "Bezirke" in German. The 12 boroughs have political rights like a town community but they are not a legal city.
On January 1, 2001 there was a Berlin borough reform. The reform cut the number of Berlin's boroughs from 23 to 12. This was the result of combining several of the old boroughs. The reform was done in order to cut down administration costs.
