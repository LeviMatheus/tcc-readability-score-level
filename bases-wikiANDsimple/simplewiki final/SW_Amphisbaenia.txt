Amphisbaenia are the third suborder of Squamata. A bit strange; amphisbaenians have features that link them to both lizards and snakes, yet have enough of their own derived features to leave them as a separate suborder.
The have 4 families comprising 18 genera and a total of about 160 species. Amphisbaenians have adapted themselves to both an above and below ground existence. Below is the family menu. As soon as I can get some good information on these squamatans, there will be more.
