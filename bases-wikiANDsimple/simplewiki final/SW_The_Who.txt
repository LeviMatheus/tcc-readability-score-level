The Who are a popular English rock band. It is made up of Roger Daltrey (vocals), Pete Townshend (guitar), John Entwistle (bass), and Keith Moon (drums). The Who was formed in a suburb of London, England as a rock group; in 1964, 18-year old Keith Moon joined the group and they hit it big with their album "My Generation". Fueled by their rebellious spirits and clashing personalities, they followed up with many other songs and albums mostly written by Pete Townshend including the "rock operas" "Quadrophenia" and "Tommy". The group faced several blows including the death of Keith Moon in 1978 and the death of John Entwistle in 2002.
