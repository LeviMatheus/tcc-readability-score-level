Minesweeper is a strategy game that comes with most Microsoft computer operating systems. It is available for many other operating systems and desktop environments as well. The object of the game is to clear a minefield of mines. By clicking on bricks, the player learns if the brick contains a bomb. If they do not see a bomb, the game continues. When the player clicks on a brick, a number may appear. The number shows how many bombs are next to this square. This helps the player find out where the bombs are.
The game is won when every brick that does not contain a bomb has been clicked.
