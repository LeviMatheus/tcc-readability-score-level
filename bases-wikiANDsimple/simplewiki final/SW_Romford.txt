Romford is a place in the east London Borough of Havering, England. It was first recorded as a town in 1153 in the "Red Book of the Exchequer", and the name "Romford" means "wide ford". The stream that flows through the place was only later called "the Rom River" after the town.
In medieval times, this town was granted the right to have the only market for 6 2/3 miles around. This rule was used even in the 1990s to stop a nearby suburb, Ilford, from opening a market too close.
