The Bronze Medal of Military Valor (Italian language: "Medaglia di bronzo al Valore Militare") is an Italian medal awarded by the King of Italy.
During World War I, the medal was awarded to military personnel for exceptional valor in combat. For each subsequent act of valor, the recipient was awarded a bar in the corresponding class. As the Gold medal and the Silver Medal, after the World War II, the Bronze Medal was gave to the cities that fought against the nazism and the fascism during the war.
