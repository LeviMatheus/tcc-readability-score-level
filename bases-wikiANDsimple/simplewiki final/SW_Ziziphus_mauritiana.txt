Ziziphus mauritiana (Indian Jujube, or Cottony Jujube) is a type of fruit tree. It is most often found in south-east Asia, usually India.
The plant is a vigorous grower and has a rapidly-developing taproot. It may be a bushy shrub 1-2 m high, or a tree 3-12 m tall; erect or wide-spreading, with gracefully drooping branches and downy, zigzag branchlets, with short, sharp straight or hooked spines. It may be evergreen, or leafless for several weeks in hot summers. The leaves are alternate, 2.5-6 cm long. On the upper surface, they are very glossy, dark-green, with 3 conspicuous, depressed, longitudinal veins, and there are very fine teeth on the margins. The 5-petalled flowers are yellow, tiny, in 2's or 3's in the leaf axils. The fruit of wild trees is 1-2.5 cm long. With sophisticated cultivation, the fruit reaches 6 cm in length and be oval, obovate, round or oblong; the skin smooth or rough, glossy, thin but tough, turns from light-green to yellow, later becomes partially or wholly burnt-orange or red-brown. When slightly underripe, the flesh is white, crisp, juicy, acid or subacid to sweet, somewhat astringent, much like that of a crabapple. Fully ripe fruits are less crisp, overripe fruits are wrinkled, the flesh buff-coloured, soft, spongy and musky. At first the aroma is applelike and pleasant but it becomes peculiarly musky as the fruit ages. There is a single, hard, oval rough central stone which contains elliptic brown seeds.
