The Serengeti (sometimes also called Seremgeti desert) is a region of woodlands and grasslands in southern Africa. The south of it belongs to Tanzania. The north of it is in Kenya. It is about 30.000 square kilometers big. 80 percent of it belongs to Tanzania.
It has more than 1.6 million herbivores and thousands of predators. Wildebeests, gazelles, zebras and buffalos are the animals most commonly found in the region.
This area is most famous for the migration that takes place every year.
Every year around October nearly 1.5 million herbivores travel towards the southern plains, crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills for the rains. And then back to the north through the west, once again crossing the Mara river, after the rains in around April. This phenomenon is sometimes also called the Circular Migration.
Also in this area is the archeologically significant Olduvai Gorge where some of the oldest hominid fossils are found.
The Serengeti region contains the Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area and Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
