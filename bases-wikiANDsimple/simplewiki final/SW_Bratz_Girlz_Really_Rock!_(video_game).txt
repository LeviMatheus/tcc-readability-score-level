"Bratz Girlz Really Rock!" is an upcoming rhythm game being made by Blitz Games with other help from THQ. It is part of the Bratz franchise. The game is expected to be released in North America on October 14, 2008.
Overview.
In the Bratz Girlz Really Rock video game, girls play as Cloe, Jade, Sasha or Yasmin as they glam it up at Camp Starshine, a summer camp for the performing arts. When the girls befriend an accomplished ballerina, they join together for the performance of a lifetime in the camp talent competition. Players can practice in the recording studio or go on stage for a live guitar or keyboard performance of music from the DVD movie soundtrack. The makeover station provides players with realistic lipstick tubes and blush brushes to apply the latest make-up trends as well as cut, color and curling options for new hairstyles. Exciting new mini-games include skydiving in chic aerial poses, miniature golfing across up to 18 holes, playing the guitar or keyboard in a recording studio or live on stage, as well as dancing in a studio or performing on stage.
