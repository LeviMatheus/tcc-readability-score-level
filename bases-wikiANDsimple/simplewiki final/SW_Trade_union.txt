A trade union is an organisation or group of workers who join together to get better pay, hours, benefits, and working conditions.
Strikes.
If collective bargaining does not work, unions often use strikes to get their demands. However, the threat of a strike is usually enough: over 98% of union contracts are renewed without a strike.
History.
Trade unions are close to trade guilds in Medieval times. These guilds were made up of independent skilled workers (or artisans) who joined together.
Criticism.
Unions have been criticized for increasing the cost of workers. Because of this, it is said that less people will be hired.
