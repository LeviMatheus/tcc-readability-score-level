The British Rail Class 101 diesel multiple units were built by Metro-Cammell at Washwood Heath in Birmingham from 1956 to 1959, following construction of a series of prototype units. This class proved to be the most successful and longest-lived of all BR's "First Generation" DMUs, with the final five units being withdrawn on 24 December 2003. The oldest set was, by then, just over 47 years old.
