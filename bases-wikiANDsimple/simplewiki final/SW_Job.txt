A job is work that a person does to earn money. The word "job" is usually only used when a person works for someone else "an employer" who pays for the work. For example, a teacher's job is to teach children or adults. A taxi driver's job is to drive people in a taxi. A firefighter rescues people from burning buildings and puts out fires. A dermatologist's job is to diagnose and treat skin diseases.
