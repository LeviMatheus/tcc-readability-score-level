Astika (Sanskrit:: "orthodox") and Nastika: ("heterodox") are technical terms in Hinduism used to classify philosophical schools and persons, according to whether they accept the authority of the Vedas as supreme revealed scriptures, or not. By this definition, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya, Yoga, Purva Mimamsa and Vedanta are classified as "astika" schools; while Charvaka, Jainism and Buddhism are considered "nastika" schools.
In non-technical usage, the term "astika" is sometimes loosely translated as "theist" while "nastika" is translated as "atheist". However this interpretation is distinct from the use of the term in Hindu philosophy. Notably even among the "astika" schools, "samkhya"and the early "mimamsa" school do not accept a God (see Atheism in Hinduism) while accepting the authority of the Vedas; they thus are "atheistic "astika" schools".
At an early period, during the formation of the Upanişads and the rise of Buddhism and Jainism, we must envisage a common heritage of meditation and mental discipline practiced by renouncers with varying affiliations to non-orthodox (Veda-rejecting) and orthodox (Veda-accepting) traditions... These schools [such as Buddhism and Jainism] are understandably regarded as heterodox ("nāstika") by orthodox ("āstika") Brahmanism.
Tantras are... also divided as "āstika" or Vedic and "nāstika" or non-Vedic. In accordance with the predominance of the deity the "āstika" works are again divided as Śākta, Śaiva, Saura, Gāṇapatya and Vaiṣṇava.
