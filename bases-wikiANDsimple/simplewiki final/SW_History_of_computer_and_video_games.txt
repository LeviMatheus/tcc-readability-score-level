Video games were introduced as an entertainment medium in 1971, becoming the start for a big entertainment industry in the late 1970s/early 1980s in the United States, Japan, and Europe. After a bad industry collapse in 1983 and a rebirth two years later; the video game industry has experienced large growth for over twenty years to become a $10 billion industry, which rivals the motion picture industry as the most profitable (money earned) entertainment industry in the world.
