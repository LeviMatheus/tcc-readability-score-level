Heat conduction or Thermal conduction is the spontaneous transfer of thermal energy through matter, from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature. It always leads to even out temperature differences.
Heat can also be transferred by Thermal radiation and/or convection, and it is normal that more than one of these processes happen at the same time.
In the atomic theory solids, liquids and gases are made of tiny particles called atoms. The temperature of the material measures how fast the atoms are moving and the heat measures the total amount of energy due to the vibration of the atoms.
You might imagine conduction to take place when one part of a material is heated. The atoms in this part vibrate faster and are more likely to hit their neighbours.When collisions take place the energy is passed on to the neighbouring atoms allowing the energy to travel through the solid. (Rather like the way energy passes along a set of tumbling dominos.)
The atomic picture also helps explain why conduction is more important in solids: in solids the atoms are close together and unable to move around. In liquids and gases the particles can move past each other so the collisions are less common
