Michael John ("Mick") Collins (; 16 October 1890 – 22 August 1922) was an Irish revolutionary leader. He was Minister for Finance in the First Dáil of 1919, Director of Intelligence for the IRA, and member of the Irish delegation during the Anglo-Irish Treaty negotiations. Later, he was both Chairman of the Provisional Government and Commander-in-chief of the National Army. He was shot and killed in August 1922, during the Irish Civil War.
Most Irish political parties think his contributions were important to make the modern Irish state. Members and supporters of Fine Gael remember him in particular as one of the founders of their movement, or its predecessor Cumann na nGaedhael. That name was adopted in 1923 by the pro-Treaty wing of Sinn Fein.
