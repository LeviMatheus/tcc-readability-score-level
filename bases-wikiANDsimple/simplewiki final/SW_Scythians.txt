The Scythians or Scyths () were an Iranian speaking people of horse-riding nomadic pastoralists who dominated the Pontic steppe throughout Classical Antiquity. By Late Antiquity the closely-related Sarmatians came to dominate the Scyths in this area. Much of the surviving information about the Scyths comes from the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 440 BC) in his "Histories", and archaeologically from the exquisite goldwork found in Scythian burial mounds in Ukraine and Southern Russia.
