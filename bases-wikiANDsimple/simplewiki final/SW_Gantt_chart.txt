A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that shows a project schedule. Gantt charts show the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. Terminal elements and summary elements comprise the work breakdown structure of the project. Some Gantt charts also show the dependency (i.e., precedence network) relationships between activities. Gantt charts can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line (also called "TIME NOW" or "DATA DATE"). It is an intrument or tool of the Project management invented by the engineer Henry L. Gannt.
