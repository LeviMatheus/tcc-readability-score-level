"The Prince" is a book written by Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, who lived in the city of Florence in the country of Italy. The book was published in 1532.
The book talks about politics and government. During his life, Machiavelli saw many changes in the government of Florence. He thought a lot about what a king or prince should do to make a strong government. In the book, he said the ruler had to get a lot of power.
One of the things he said that made people worried, was that ethics and politics are different. A person might have to do things that are "wrong" to get power, but with power he could then do "good" things. This thought made people upset.
But other things he said sounded very wise. So people read the book and talk about it, to see what things are true and false.
