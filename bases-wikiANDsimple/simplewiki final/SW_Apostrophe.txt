An apostrophe is a form of punctuation used in writing. The following words have an apostrophe in them: can't, it's, Mike's.
This is a wrong use of an apostrophe: Those dog's are big.
Apostrophes are used to show that some letters have been taken out in an abbreviation.
Apostropes are also used to show something belongs to someone (or something).
But the word 'its', meaning 'something belonging to it', does "not" have an apostrophe.
This is also the same with "your," "their," and "our."
for example: That's not mine, it's yours. That's not ours, it's theirs.
You should not put an apostrophe in the middle of a word ending in s, such as a plural. Put an apostrophe, or 's, at the end of the word instead.
"Go get 'em tiger!" or "Li'l Bow Bow"
