In the United Kingdom, a riding was a section of a large county. It is usually one of three parts. The word comes from "tri-thing".
Several counties were divided into ridings, but are usually governed by the same council. The ridings of Yorkshire were so large that each riding was given its own county council. There was a North Riding, a West Riding and an East Riding. In 1974 when all the counties of England and Wales were reorganised, the new four areas were called North, West, and South Yorkshire and also Humberside.
In Canada, a riding is a federal constituency, or "electoral division" as they are known in Canada.
