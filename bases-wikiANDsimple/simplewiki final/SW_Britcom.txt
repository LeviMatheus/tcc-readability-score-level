A Britcom is short for British Sitcom. It is a situation comedy show produced in the United Kingdom. This is what they are called especially in the United States and Australia, where they have cult followings. Some of them like "Till Death Do Us Part" and "Steptoe and Son" were remade as American comedy TV shows ("All in the Family" and "Sanford and Son").
