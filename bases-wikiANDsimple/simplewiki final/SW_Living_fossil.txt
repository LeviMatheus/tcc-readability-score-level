Living fossil refers to life forms which have survived for a long time, and which can still be found today. For example, crocodiles are believed to have evolved approximately 200 million years ago (50 times longer than human evolution), River Dolphins are a living fossil that they do not have a common ancestor with any other living creature for around 25 million years, and thus they are considered to be living fossils.
