Winnie the Pooh is a fictional bear created by A. A. Milne. He is based on a stuffed toy that belonged to Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne. The toy was named after "Winnipeg" ("Winnie" for short), who was a bear at the London Zoo and the mascot of a Canadian army regiment, and "Pooh", which was a nickname Milne and his son had given to a swan. The first book was published in 1926. There were later other books published, and Walt Disney made a series of cartoons based on the books. The Walt Disney Company still owns the character.
There have been quite a few series created by Walt Disney based on these books.
