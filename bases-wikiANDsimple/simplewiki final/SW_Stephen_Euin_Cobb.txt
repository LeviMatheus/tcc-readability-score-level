Stephen Euin Cobb (born February 3, 1955) is an American science fiction author and the host of the award-winning podcast "The Future And You". He was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina. Cobb spent his childhood in Forest Park, Illinois (a suburb of Chicago). He now lives in South Carolina. Cobb is a member of the Beaver Creek Tribe of Native American Indians in South Carolina. His mother served one term as a member of the Tribal Counsel. He is between 1/8 and 1/4 Native American.
In the online science fiction magazine "Jim Baen's Universe", Cobb writes about what he thinks our lives might be like in the future. On his show, "The Future And You" (which is similar to a two-hour long radio talk show), he asks authors, celebrities, scientists and other people who write about the future what they think the future will be like for people to live in.
"Bones Burnt Black" (2004) is his most popular novel (he reads a chapter of it in his show, like an audio book). His first published novel was "Plague at Redhook" (1999). His most popular game is called Death Stacks. Every summer in Charlotte, North Carolina many people come together and play this game to see who can play it the best. The four winners each get a trophy.
