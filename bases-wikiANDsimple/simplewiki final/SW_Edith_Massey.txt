Edith Massey (May 25, 1918 - October 24, 1984) was an American actress.
She acted in several of director John Waters' most well-known movies: "Multiple Maniacs", "Pink Flamingos", "Female Trouble", "Desperate Living", and "Polyester". Waters discovered Massey as a waitress in a Baltimore, Maryland, USA bar he and his friends frequented.
In the late 1970s-early 1980s, Massey capitalized on her Waters-infamy by touring as the lead singer of a punk band (Edie and the Eggs) and opening a thrift store in Baltimore called Edith's Shopping Bag.
Director Robert Maier made a documentary short about her in 1975 called "Love Letter to Edie".
