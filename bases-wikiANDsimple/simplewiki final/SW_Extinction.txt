Extinction is when there is none of a certain animal left. This can be caused by habitat loss or by being overhunted. An example of an animal that is extinct is the Dodo. An animal that is endangered has a good chance of becoming extinct.
When talking about volcanos, extinct means that the volcano is no longer active.
The Dodo, once thought to be extinct has been identified in the an old documentary filmed in middle Africa. Thought to be extinct hundreds of years ago, the bird was identified in the background of a documentary of the African jungle. Most researchers did not believe the story until they personally observed the video during a cleanup of an old schools reel films. The unusually odd happening has stunned the scientific world and raised questions if there are other extinct animals still living. The bird has been placed on the extinction list once again since there had been no reported sightings since the 1917 film.
