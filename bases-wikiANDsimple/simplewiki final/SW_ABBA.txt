ABBA became very popular after they won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1974. They had many hits. These included "Dancing Queen", "SOS", "Mamma Mia", and "Waterloo". Most of their songs were written by Ulvaeus and Andersson.
They broke up in 1982, but their music is still popular. It has appeared in movies (including the Australian films "The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and "Muriel's Wedding") and the musical "Mamma Mia!".
