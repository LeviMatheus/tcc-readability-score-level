Overview.
Dark Horse creates many comics based on other peoples characters and settings. These include comics based on "Star Wars", "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "Aliens", and "Who Wants to be a Superhero?" Dark Horse also publishes comics by artists who own their own settings. These include Frank Miller's "Sin City" and "300", Mike Mignola's "Hellboy", Stan Sakai's "Usagi Yojimbo", Katsuhiro Otomo's "Akira" and Michael Chabon's "The Escapist". From 1993-1996, Dark Horse published a line of superhero comics under the name Comics Greatest World. This was later re-named Dark Horse Heroes. After 1996, publication in this line slowed greatly. They stopped making any books about the characters in the early 2000's. Today, the company does very well even though they do not have their own universe of superpowered characters.
Dark Horse's movie company, Dark Horse Entertainment, creates movies based on Dark Horse Comics. These including "The Mask" and "Hellboy".
The company also produces novels based on some of their more popular comic book titles, including "Aliens" and "Predator".
