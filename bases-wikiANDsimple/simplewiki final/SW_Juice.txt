Juice is a liquid that comes from plants, animals or fruit. The juice from fruit is often made into a drink. Some juices that are often made into drinks are apple, orange, tomato, pineapple, grapefruit, guava, mango, passionfruit, tropical, carrot, watermelon, cranberry, grape, lemon and lime, but there are many others. Lots of people drink fruit juices because fruit juice is very healthy. Some drink companies make fruit juice, and the juice that they make usually has a lot of sugar added, but most fruit juice is really good for people.
Juice can be bought from a store, already in bottles. Companies sell fruit juice just like any other drink. Juices are made by squeezing the juice out of the fruit.
If something has a lot of juice in it, it is said to be juicy. Juice does not have to be a drink. It can just be a liquid contained in something.
