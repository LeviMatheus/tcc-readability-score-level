A family is a group of people who must have consanguinity and live together. They share the housework and take care of one another, the member of the family have responsibility for each other.
Types of families.
Three types of family are: "nuclear family", "single-parent family" and "extended family".
A nuclear family is made up of father, mother and one or more children living together.
A single-parent family is one where either the mother or father is caring for the children in the family.
Extended family means father, mother, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, nieces and nephews. In most cases in the United States the extended family no longer lives in the same place, but in many countries including China and India, extended families traditionally live together.
Divorce and families.
Sometimes there is a divorce, and a family is split between the husband and the wife. A judge will decide if and when children live with their mother or father.
If the parents re-marry, the children of their new husband or wife are their stepchildren. "Step-" can be put before any relation to show it is from another marriage. If there are children in the new marriage, children from a former marriage are called half-brothers or half-sisters, since they are "half" related.
Families are very different in this day and age!!
