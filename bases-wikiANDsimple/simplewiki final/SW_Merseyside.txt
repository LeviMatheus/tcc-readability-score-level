Settlements.
Merseyside is divided into two parts by the Mersey estuary, the Wirral is located on the west side of the estuary, upon the Wirral Peninsula and the rest of the county is located on the east side of the estuary.
The two parts are linked by two road tunnels, a railway tunnel, and the famous Mersey Ferry. Other districts that are part of the urban area (but not part of Merseyside) are Ellesmere Port and Neston and Halton. The designation "Greater Merseyside" has been adopted for the area that includes Merseyside and Halton, the term "Liverpool City-Region" is less well-defined. Most of the region was once served by the now scraped MTL Trust Holdings Ltd transport company.
