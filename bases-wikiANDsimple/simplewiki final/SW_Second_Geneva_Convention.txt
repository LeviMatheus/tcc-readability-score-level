The Second Geneva Convention of 1906 is one of the Geneva Conventions. Its full title is Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded in Armies in the Field. It was made in Geneva, on 6 July 1906. It extended the principles from the First Geneva Convention of 1864 on the treatment of battlefield casualties. The Convention of 1906 should not be confused with "Convention (II) for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea" (Geneva, 12 August 1949).
As of 27 June 2006, when Nauru adopted the convention, it has been ratified by 194 countries.
