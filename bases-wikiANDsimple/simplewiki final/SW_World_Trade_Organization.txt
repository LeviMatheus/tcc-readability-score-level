The World Trade Organization (WTO) is an international group of many countries. In 1995, WTO was born. On 15th December 2005,There are 153 countries who are members of the WTO. In the WTO, Agreements are made on trade between countries. The “GATT” agreement means that countries have to lower barriers to international trade, such as tax on goods crossing borders. This means that businesses can operate in many different countries.
Member countries of the WTO sign agreements.
There are about 30 such agreements. Based on these agreements, the member countries do trade with each other. They give items to each other and follow a set of rules. They have to give a special job to the other country. The phrase used (for such and many alike items) is to give the other country a special job – this is known as to give the other country "a most favored country job". From 2004, if a member gives any item to another member country, the same type of item should be given to all the other member countries. From its very beginning, the WTO has also gotten some bad comments.
