Poetry is a type of art form and a type of literature.
Poetry uses the qualities of words, in different ways, to be artistic.
(Poetry can be as short, as a few words, or as long as a book (an epic)).
There are many "poetic forms" (forms of poetry).
Some of them are: Sonnet, Haiku, Ballad, Stev, Ode, Free verse, Blank verse, thematic, and nursery rhymes.
Poetry can be used to describe(comparing, talking about, or expressing emotion) many things. It can make sense or be nonsense, it can rhyme or not. It can have many shapes and sizes; it can be serious, or it can be funny.
"To say something poetically" means to give information in an artistic way.
