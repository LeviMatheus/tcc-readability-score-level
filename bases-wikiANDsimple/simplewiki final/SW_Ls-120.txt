SuperDisk 120MB Diskettes may still be available in the marketplace, however are no longer warranted. We do not have information about where these products can be purchased.
If you currently own a SuperDisk drive, once your drive fails, it may be impossible or expensive to get your data off the diskettes. If you locate a drive in the marketplace, you may want to consider purchasing a backup drive. But for high-value data, we are recommending that our customers consider upgrading to a current technology, and transfer the information.
SuperDisk diskettes are etched with a servo pattern at the factory. This pattern is then read by the SuperDisk drive to precisely align the read/write head. The result is that a SuperDisk diskette can have 2,490 tracks, as opposed to the 160 tracks that conventional 3.5-inch 1.44 MB diskettes use.
Unlike other removable disk storage solutions, such as the Zip drive, SuperDisk is backward compatible with older diskettes. This means that you can use the same SuperDisk drive to read and write to older 1.44 MB diskettes as well as the new 120 MB SuperDisk diskettes.
Here are some current data storage and backup technologies that Imation supplies for a variety of customer needs. A combination of backup media may be the best course; for instance, backing up currently used files to Flash Drives or Micro Drives, and keeping seldom used files on DVD or CD.
