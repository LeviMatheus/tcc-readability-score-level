The Celts were many tribes in Europe.They painted themselves in blue. They greased their hair with animal fat so that it sticks up in points all over their heads, and they carry great,two-sided axes and razor-sharp spears.They were preparing an army so that they could take their lands back from Romans. They were distinguished by speaking Celtic languages. Today, the Celtic languages that remain are the Breton, Cornish, Welsh, Manx, Scottish, Irish and Gaelic languages.
The Celts is also a word used to describe a wide variety of people living in different parts of Europe before, and during, the Roman empire.
The British Isles Celts generally followed a polytheistic religion, and had great respect for nature.
They were the reason why the Angles and Saxons reached Britain. One Celt king called Vortigern was scared of the other Celts could take his tribe, so he called Angles and Saxons(barbarians) to help him take the other tribes and he offered them to live in Britain. When they came they liked Britain and they took over Vortigern's tribe to and they settled in Britain.
