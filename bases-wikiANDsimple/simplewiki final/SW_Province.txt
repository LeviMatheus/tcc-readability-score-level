A province is a subdivision of a country.
Some countries are divided into provinces. The word "province" comes from the Latin word "provincia".
Canada, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Spain, and Denmark are examples of countries that are divided into provinces.
Departements usually have less power than provinces. Cantons, states, Bundesl√§nder and autonomous communities have more power than provinces.
Small countries like Singapore are not divided.
Province should not be confused with Provence, which is a region in France.
