A plane is a tool for shaping wood. Planes are used to flatten, reduce the thickness of, and impart a smooth surface to a rough piece of lumber.
Hand planes are generally the combination of a cutting edge, such as a sharpened metal plate, attached to a firm body, that when moved over a wood surface, take up relatively uniform shavings, by nature of the body riding on the 'high spots' in the wood, and also by providing a relatively constant angle to the cutting edge, render the planed surface very smooth.
Hand planes are ancient, originating thousands of years ago. Early planes were made from wood. The cutting blade or iron was held in place with a wooden wedge.
Parts of a Plane.
Two styles of plane are shown with some parts labeled. The top of the image is a bench plane; the bottom is a block plane.
