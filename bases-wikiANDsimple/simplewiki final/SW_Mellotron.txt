The Mellotron is a musical instrument, which appeared in the 1960s. It was the world's first sampled keyboard. Mellotrons contained tape loops made from the sounds of other musical instruments. Instead of sounding exactly like the original instruments, the Mellotron had a unique sound.
Mellotrons did not travel well, and had to be carefully set up every time they were moved. They became popular in recording studios, and with musicians who could leave them in one location.
The Beatles liked the sound of the Mellotron, and used it in many of their songs, like "Strawberry Fields Forever". John Lennon, a member of the Beatles, owned a Mellotron that he kept in his home studio. Paul McCartney and George Harrison, also members of the band, used Mellotrons in their solo recordings. Lennon's instrument was later owned by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who used it on his album "The Downward Spiral". Harry Nilsson also used a Mellotron on some of his recordings.
Mellotrons are now obsolete and no longer made, and digital instruments have taken their place. Digital keyboards are portable, and can be used to make similar sounds anywhere.
