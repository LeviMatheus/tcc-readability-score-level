Dacia was the place where Dacians lived. It was a big district of South Eastern Europe. The northern part of the border was made up of the Carpathians; the southern part of the border of Dacia was made up of the Danube River, and the western part of the border of Dacia was made up of the Tisza River. The place where Dacia once was is now made up of Romania and Moldova, along with some of Hungary, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The capital of Dacia was Sarmizegetusa.
