Supermarkets are large grocery stores that sell a large variety of fresh and packaged food and other consumer or household products. Supermarkets are divided into sections, such as dairy, produce (fruits and vegetables), meat, packaged goods, cleaning supplies, and personal hygiene items. The term "supermarket" usually refers to a larger store than the term "grocery store."
