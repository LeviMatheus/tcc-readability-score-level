Ekiga (formerly called GnomeMeeting) is a free and open source VoIP and video conferencing computer application for GNOME and Windows. Ekiga supports both the SIP and H.323 (based on OpenH323) protocols and is fully interoperable with any other SIP compliant application and with Microsoft NetMeeting. It supports many high-quality audio and video codecs.
Ekiga was initially made by Damien Sandras in order to graduate from the Universit√© catholique de Louvain. It is currently developed by a community-based team led by Sandras. The logo was designed based on his concept by, an open source enthusiast and a friend of his.
