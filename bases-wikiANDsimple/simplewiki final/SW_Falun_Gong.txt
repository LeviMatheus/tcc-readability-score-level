Falun Gong (also known as Falun Dafa) is a spiritual discipline from China. It was founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992. People who follow Falun Gong do five exercises and read books written by Li Hongzhi. They believe in "Truthfulness, Compassion and Forbearance", and they also believe that the Falun Gong exercises can make them healthy, and better people. There were almost 70 million Falun Gong practitioners in China, according to the government.
In 1999, after a big Falun Gong gathering in front of a Chinese government building, the Communist Party of China said: people cannot practice Falun Gong, it is "illegal." The police started putting Falun Gong followers into jails and labour camps, and torturing them. Over 3000 people who practice Falun Gong have been jailed and tortured to death. This is because the Communist party did not want so many people believing in Falun Gong, which is a non-communist belief system; they thought that Falun Gong was more popular than they were. Many people and groups outside of China have said that the Communist Party should stop jailing and killing Falun Gong people.
It is not known how many people pracise Falun Gong: The Chinese government suggests there were 70 million practitioners in China in 1998. In one article, Falun Gong's Clearwisdom.net says there are 100 million practitioners in more than 80 countries.
