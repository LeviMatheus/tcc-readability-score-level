Allan Kardec (Hippolyte Léon Denizard Rivail October 3, 1804 - March 31, 1869) was a French philosopher and teacher. He dedicated the last 15 years of his life to organise a philosophical doctrine called Spiritism. He was a great divulger of the educational ideas of Pestalozzi in the 19th century. Published books of grammar, mathematics and suggestions for the improvement of public education in France. He was a teacher of physiology, astronomy, physics and chemistry and the classes were in your own home, in Paris.
In 1854, Rivail started studying a phenomena that some people called as "paranormal" or "supernatural", that were very common in that time. Other people actually tell that these phenomenas are unknown natural´s law.
His pedagogical sense made him create a philosophy in which the spiritual manifestations were useful to social and moral improvements of men. Inspired by this idea, he dedicated his last years to organise a philosophical system with a strong educational appeal: the Spiritism (fr. "Spiritisme").
