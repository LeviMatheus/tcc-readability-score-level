Hemera was the goddess of daylight in Greek mythology. She was the daughter of Erebus and Nyx, and the sister of Moros, Charon, and the Keres.
Hyginus listed Gaia, Thalassa and Ouranos as Hemera's children.
While in Hesiod's "Theogony" Hemera was not mother of Gaia nor Ouranos, but mother of only Thalassa. Hemera got Thalassa with her brother Aether.
