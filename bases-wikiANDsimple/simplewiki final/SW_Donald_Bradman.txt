Don Bradman (often called The Don) (27 August 1908 â€“ 25 February 2001) was an Australian man who played cricket. He was a batsman. When he played his last Test Match, he only needed to score four runs to have a batting average of 100 runs over the whole of his Test Match career. But he was "out for a duck" (out before he scored any runs) after facing only two balls (pitches), so his average was 99.94, which was still much higher than any other batsman's average. Most cricket experts think he was the best batsman of all time. He was a great hero in Australia, and he was voted the greatest Australian of the 19th and 20th century.
