The Emancipation Proclamation by Abraham Lincoln was celebrated as the proclamation that freed the slaves, but it did not. He actually did not free the slaves of the Union (states under the federal government of the US), but only those who rebelled against the federal government.

In January 1863, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln made the statement to free all slaves which live in an area which rebells against the federal government. This Emancipation Proclamation did not free many people.

The proclamation did not hold for slaves in Border States fighting on the Union side (some were for the South, but Unionist state governments were left in power); and it did not hold for slaves in southern areas already under Union control.
“[…] all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do not act to repress such persons […]”
“Arkansas, Texas, Louisiana [except some named parishes], Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia, (except the forty-eight counties designated as West Virginia [and some other counties in VA])”
Although the Emancipation Proclamation did not end slavery in America, this was achieved by the passage of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in 1865.
