Helen Keller was an American writer and speaker. She was born in Tuscumbia, Alabama in 1880. When she was eighteen months old she became sick and lost her eyesight and hearing.
When Helen was seven years old, her family decided to find a teacher for her. They wrote to Michael Anegnos, who was the director of the Perkins Institute and Asylum for the Blind. They asked him to help them find a teacher for their daughter. He wrote to them and told them that he knew a young teacher and her name was Anne Sullivan. Anne traveled to Alabama to live with Helen’s family and to teach her. Anne went to live with the Keller family in March, 1887.
Anne helped Helen to learn how to communicate with other people. She taught her the names of things by writing the words on Helen’s hand. In 1890, Helen’s family sent her to the Perkins Institute to learn how to speak and communicate. When she was nineteen years old, Helen went to Radcliffe College in Massachusetts. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1904. She was the first deaf and blind person to obtain a Bachelors of Arts degree.
In 1903, Helen wrote a book about her life. It was called "The Story of My Life". She wrote twelve other books. Some of them became movies, like The Miracle Worker, made in 1962. She tried to help poor people and other blind people during her life. Helen traveled to over 39 countries with Anne to talk about her life and experiences. She also wrote a book about Annie Sullivan called "Teacher". Helen Keller died on June 1, 1968, at Arcan Ridge in Connecticut.
