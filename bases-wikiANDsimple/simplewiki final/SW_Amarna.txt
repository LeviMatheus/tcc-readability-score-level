The site of Amarna (Arabic: العمارنة "al-‘amārnä") is located on the east bank of the Nile River in the Egyptian province of Minya. Amarna includes several modern villages, including el-Till in the north and el-Hagg Qandil in the south.
The area contains a large Egyptian archaeological site that represents the remains of the capital city built by the Pharaoh Akhenaten of the late Eighteenth Dynasty. The name for the city used by the ancient Egyptians is written as "Akhetaten" in English. It translates to "the Horizon of the Aten".
