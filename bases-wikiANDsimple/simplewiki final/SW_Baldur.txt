Baldur (Baldr, Balder) is Odin's second son. He is the god of summer sun, light, and radiance. His twin brother is the blind god of darkness, Hodhr. His wife is called Nanna. They have a son, called Forseti, god of justice. Baldur also has a ship, which is the largest ship ever built. It is called Hringhorni. His hall is called Breidlabik.
Based on the Merseburg charms, his germanic name may have been Phol.
Baldur once had a bad dream that he would be killed. His mother, Frigg, made all the things on Earth vow not to hurt him. But she forgot the mistletoes. Loki made a spear out of mistletoes, and tricked Hodhr to kill Baldur with it. The death of Baldur is the start of Ragnarok. Many gods and goddesses came to his funeral. His wife Nana also died of sadness. His father, Odin, placed the golden ring Draupnir on Baldur, but he later sent the ring back from Hell. This ring somehow came to Freyr's hand.
After Ragnarok and the death of Odin, Baldur and Hodhr came back to heaven, and they rule in place of their father.
