"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" was a 1975 movie based on a book by Ken Kesey. Milos Forman was the movie's director, and Jack Nicholson was the main actor.
It was the first movie to win all five main Academy Awards since "It Happened One Night" in 1934. These awards included Best Picture, Best Actor (Nicholson), Best Actress (Louise Fletcher), Best Director (Forman), and Best Adapted Screenplay.
This much-loved movie was the 20th best ever, according to the American Film Industry's AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.
The book's writer, Kesey, did not like the movie, since it did not take the perspective (view) of a Native American character, Chief Bromden (an important part of the book).
