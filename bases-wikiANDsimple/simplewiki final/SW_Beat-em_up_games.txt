Beat-em up games are video games where the player beats up bad guys while walking through levels. Sometimes the player have to beat up certain bad guys to progress through the game. Most of the time, these games have level bosses which are usually at the end of the level. Examples of "beat-em up" games are arcade games like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and The Simpsons. Super Smash Bros. Brawl also has a "beat-em up" part in the game where the player fights bad guys from the Subspace Emissary and fight other characters as well in order to beat the levels.
