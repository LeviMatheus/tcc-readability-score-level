Vanadium is chemical element 23 on the periodic table. Its symbol is V.
Vanadium is a metal and is part of the group known as the transition metals. It is mostly used in steel where it helps strengthen the steel metal.
The human body may require a little bit of vanadium, even though scientists aren't really sure. There is a little bit of vanadium in vitamins just to make sure that we do not get sick (in case our body does need vanadium).
Vanadium can react with a variety of other elements, and the chemical compounds it forms often have beautiful colors.
