A kite shield is a Middle Age shield in the shape of a kite. The kite shield was used by many knights and people for protection, but was given up for two-handed weapons and more mobility.
The efficiency of the kite shields shields shape came into action when cavalry combat occurred, useful to protect most of the body from the shoulders down to the feet, giving the knight more options in combat. The kite shield was useful, giving the knight options to fight with his sword hand without having to worry too much about being struck on the other side.
