Mesopotamia (from Greek meaning "between the rivers") is the region where parts of Iraq, eastern Syria, and southeastern Turkey are now, between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers. It is part of the Fertile crescent.
The area is often called the "Cradle of Civilization". The ancient writing called cuneiform was first used around 3000 BC by the Sumerians. They lived in city-states (a city and the land around it). According to Genesis in the Old Testament, Abraham lived in Mesopotamia before moving to Canaan.
Many great advances in technology were made by the ancient Sumerians and Mesopotamians, such as irrigation, the use of small canals in order to move water through fields, and trade by river. Mesopotamians created the "almost modern" form of paper, and were the first to domesticate animals, or livestock.
The Mesopotamians also wrote a long story called The Epic Of Gilgamesh, who was a famous king in the city of Uruk. His best friend was called Enkidu, who lived in the wilderness with the animals before he a priestess defouled him and tore away his innocence, a trait of great shame in the eyes of humanity. The priestess introduced him to Gilgamesh and they became friends.
