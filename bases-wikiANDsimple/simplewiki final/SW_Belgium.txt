Belgium ("BelgiÃ«" in Dutch, "Belgique" in French and "Belgien" in German) is a country in Europe. It is next to France, Luxembourg, Germany, and the Netherlands.
The capital city of Belgium is Brussels.
There are three regions in Belgium: Flanders (where the Flemish speak Dutch) in the northern half of Belgium, Wallonia (where most Walloons speak French in the southern half and the Brussels-Capital Region in the middle (where Dutch and French are spoken).
Inside Wallonia is the area of the German-speaking Community of Belgium. The community has its own parliament and government, but they are not yet as powerful as the Flemish and Walloon bodies.
Belgium is famous for high quality chocolate, french fries, comic books, and many kinds of beer.
