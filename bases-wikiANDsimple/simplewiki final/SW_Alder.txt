Alder is the common name for about 30 kinds of trees and shrubs of the Alnus genus. They are a part of the birch family ("Betulaceae"). Most of them are smaller in size. Leaves are mostly deciduous, only very few alders are evergreen.
The best known species are the Black Alder, which can be seen throughout Europe. The largest is probably the Red Alder, native to North America. It reaches about 32-35 metres in height. The widespread Green Alder is a shrub, rarely more than 5m high.
Alder is a preferred tree for bees, especially in spring. It is also used to make charcoal.
