Taxidermy (which comes from the Greek word for "the arrangement of skin") is act of taking the skin of an animal and preserving it, by putting it on a fake body. The taxidermed animals can be mounted and put on display, sometimes in a museum or a home. Many hunters and fishermen taxidermine the animals they catch and kill for trophies. Ones that are on display in museums are used to make dioramas and for educational purposes. Some people taxiderm their pets after they die.
