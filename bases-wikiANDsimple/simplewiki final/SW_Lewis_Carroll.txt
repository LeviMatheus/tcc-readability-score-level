Lewis Carroll was the pen name of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (January 27, 1832 â€“ January 14, 1898), a British writer, math expert, Anglican clergyman, and photographer. He is most famous for his story "Alice in Wonderland" which he told to a young friend, Alice Liddel, when he took the girl and two of her sisters on a boat trip. Alice enjoyed the story and asked Dodgson to write it down. It was eventually published as "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland." Carroll then wrote a second story about Alice called "Through the Looking Glass." Both stories are still popular with people all over the world.
