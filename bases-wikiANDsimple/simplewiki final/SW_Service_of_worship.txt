A service of worship is a religious meeting where people come together, usually in a church or cathedral, in order to worship God. It may also be called a church service or just service. It is the usual term used in the Christian religion for such a meeting.
In the Protestant church services are usually led by a priest, although sometimes they may be led by laymen (people who are not priests).
In the Christian churches services are normally held on Sundays, although there may be services on other days as well, especially in large churches or cathedrals.
Services often include Holy Communion or Eucharist. Matins is a morning service which does not include communion. An evening service is called Evensong.
Church services are also held for weddings, funerals, or other special occasions.
Services may include prayers, singing, sermons (preaching) and readings from the Bible.
