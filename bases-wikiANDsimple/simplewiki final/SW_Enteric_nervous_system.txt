The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a subdivision of the Peripheral nervous system, that directly controls the gastrointestinal system. It is capable of autonomous functions such as the coordination of reflexes, although it receives considerable innervation from the autonomic nervous system and thus is often considered a part of it.
