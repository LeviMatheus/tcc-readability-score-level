Nundle was settled when gold was found nearby at “The Hanging Rock” and Swamp Creek in 1852. By June 1852 there were 300 people digging for gold at Oakenville Creek.. People from California, Europe and China were also digging along the Peel River and up the mountain slopes. By 1865 there were about 500 people living there and about 50 shops and small businesses had started. A school building was put up in December 1871. Lessons started in 1872. Nundle was made a town in 1885. In 1924 the Peel River Bridge was built. In 1941 electricity was connected to the town. During 1966 the swimming pool was opened by the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair. There were 1350 people living in the area in 1969. In 1979 the Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, opened the new Chaffey Dam.
