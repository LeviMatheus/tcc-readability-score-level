Rutherford B. Hayes (October 4, 1822 - January 17, 1893) was the 19th President of the United States. He served only one term, from 1877 to 1881. Hayes was a Republican and was elected governor of Ohio three times prior to becoming president. Hayes narrowly won the contested election of 1876, only defeating Democratic opponent Samuel Tilden after a Congressional committee awarded Hayes some disputed electoral votes.
During his presidency, Hayes effectively ended the Reconstruction period that followed the American Civil War. He ordered the withdrawal of military forces that had occupied the Southern states. Hayes refused to seek a second term as president.
