Oxbridge is a word that is used to mean the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge in England. It used to mean a fictional mix of the two universities, but now refers to both.
The competition between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to the days when Cambridge was founded by unsatisfied scholars from Oxford.
