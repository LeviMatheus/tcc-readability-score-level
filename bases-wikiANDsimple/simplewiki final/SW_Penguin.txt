Penguins are sea-birds. They form the family "Spheniscidae", the only family of the order "Sphenisciformes".
Penguins live on the southern half of the world: Antarctica, New Zealand, southern Australia, South Africa and South America.
All Penguins have a white underside and a dark (mostly black) upperside. Penguins cannot fly, but they can swim very well. They have good hearing and can see well underwater. The white and black colors are for camouflage (to help them hide) when they swim: a predator looking from underwater sees the white underside of the penguin, which not seen well with the light coming from above; from above the penguin's black upperside can not be seen well in the dark water.
Most penguins eat krill, fish, squid, and other small animals from the ocean, which they catch while swimming underwater.
Taxonomy.
There are 16-19 living species (types) of penguins. The White-flippered Penguin is today generally considered a subspecies of the Little Penguin. It is still unclear if the Royal Penguin is a subspecies of the Macaroni Penguin. It is also possible that northern and southern Rockhopper Penguins are separate species.
