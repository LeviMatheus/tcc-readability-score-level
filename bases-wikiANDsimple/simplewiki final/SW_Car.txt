A car (also called an automobile) is a machine used for travel (a vehicle).
Structure.
A car has an engine, put together with three or more wheels and a steering wheel. Some have more wheels: big trucks that carry heavy things can have 18 wheels, sometimes even more. Cars come in many shapes and sizes. They usually have a seat for the driver and at least one passenger. Some are also able to carry many passengers. For example, family station wagons carry from 8 to 9 people. Buses can carry even more, but are much bigger. In order for a car to move, it must have fuel, most often gasoline, which is sometimes called petrol. Other common fuels include diesel, natural gas, or electricity.
Advantages.
Cars are faster than walking and riding a bike, can carry more than one person, and are easy to use. They are used in many countries around the world.
Another good thing is that if it's raining heavily it is better to use a car than a bike or walking because driving a car in these conditions can be less dangerous.
Disadvantages.
If two cars crash they can hurt the people inside or around them. Traffic Jams happen when there are too many cars trying to go the same way. They can create pollution if too many are used in a small area like a city. Many places with many people have public transportation - buses, trains, and subways - that can help many people get to different places very quickly.
Carpooling is putting more people in one car to use less fuel and create less pollution.
