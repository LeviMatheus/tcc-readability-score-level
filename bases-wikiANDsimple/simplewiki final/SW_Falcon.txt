Falcons are small birds of prey and are related to hawks and eagles. They usually have pointed wings and long tails. Most falcons eat small mammals that they hunt using eyesight, although some species hunt other birds, which they take in flight. Like hawks, most falcons have dark gray or brown backs and wings, with white undersides.
The Peregrine falcon is found over most of the world and is famous for hunting birds by diving down on them at 320 h (200 h). It was nearly wiped out in North America by the use of pesticides, but has since made a recovery.
