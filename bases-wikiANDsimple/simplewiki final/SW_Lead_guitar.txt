Lead guitar means the use of a guitar to perform melody lines, instrumental fills, and soloes within a song structure.
In rock and metal bands, the lead guitarist is usually supported by a second guitarist who plays rhythm guitar (chords and riffs). In some rock or metal bands with two guitarists, the two performers may perform as a "guitar tandem", and trade off the lead guitar and rhythm guitar roles.
