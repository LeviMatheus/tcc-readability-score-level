A situation comedy, usually called a sitcom, is a type of comedy program. Sitcoms were first on radio, before television was invented, but are now on television and are a large part of the programs shown. Sitcoms usually have the same characters in the same places (for example; a home, a workplace, a city or town) on every episode.
