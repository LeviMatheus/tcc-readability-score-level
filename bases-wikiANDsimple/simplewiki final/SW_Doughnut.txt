A doughnut (spelt donut in American English) is a sweet deep-fried piece of dough or batter.
Types of doughnut.
The two most common types of doughnut are ring doughnuts, which are shaped like rings, and filled doughnuts, which are round and have jam, jelly, custard, whipped cream, or chocolate inside them. Most doughnut have an icing (also called a "frosting") made with icing sugar, water, and flavourings (such as chocolate). Some doughnut are rolled in sweet foods such as sugar or shredded coconut.
Serving.
Doughnuts are often eaten in the morning, along with a cup of hot coffee. Doughnuts can be purchased from doughnut shops or from grocery stores. People also eat doughnuts as a dessert, or as a snack.
Health problems.
Doughnuts can cause health problems if they are eaten too often. One of these problems is that doughnuts contain a large amount of fat. Eating too much fat can lead to clogged arteries. When the arteries get clogged, blood doesn't go through them easily. Also, doughnut contain a large amount of sugar and white flour, which are converted into fat when they come inside our body.
