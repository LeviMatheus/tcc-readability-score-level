The Committee of Union and Progress was a political group. It was made by Bahaeddin Sakir in 1906 during the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The group was one of the Young Turks. This group came to power between 1908 and 1918. At the end of World War I most of its members were court-martialled by the sultan Mehmed VI and imprisoned. The remnants of the organization were eliminated from the Republic of Turkey during the "assassination of president" trials in 1926.
