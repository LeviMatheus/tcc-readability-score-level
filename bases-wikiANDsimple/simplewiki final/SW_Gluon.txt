Gluons are what hold quarks together to make bigger particles. Gluons carry the strong force between other quarks, so it is considered a force carrying particle. Photons do the same thing, but for the electromagnetic force. Also like photons, gluons are spin-1 particles, and when a particle has spin-1 it is considered a boson.
