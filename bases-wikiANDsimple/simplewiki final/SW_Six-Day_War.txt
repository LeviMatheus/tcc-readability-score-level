The Six-Day War was a war that started on June 5, 1967 and ended June 10, 1967. The fight was between Israel and Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, but many other countries helped out the different sides.
History.
The war began because Egypt, Syria and Jordan were extremely anti-Jewish and wanted to destroy Israel completely. Before they could attack, Israel planned a preemptive, or first, strike against the Egyptians. This attack was against the Egyptian airfields. The Egyptians had 50 runways and about 960 attack craft, but Israelis only had about 200 attack craft, so Israel attacked while Egypt's planes were still on the ground. In three hours the entire Egyptian air force was wiped out. This surprised the Egyptians, and Israel went on to attack on the ground and claim victory. Israel then attacked Syria and Jordan and defeated them quickly. The entire war took only six days from beginning to end, which is how it got its name.
