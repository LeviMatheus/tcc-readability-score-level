A "shabono" (also called "xapono" or "yano") is a hut used by the Yanomami indios, who live in southeastern Venezuela and in northern Roraima, Brazil. This hut is used as temporary shelter and is made with palm leaves and wood. Shabonos are built in clear parts of the jungle. Each family unit has a personal area in the shabono.
