The rormation and evolution of the Solar System is the name for the many ideas describing how the Solar System began and how it will carry on changing. The accepted idea is this; 4.6 million years ago there was a very big cloud of gas in our area of space, known as a nebula. The Nebula eventually became so big that gravity pulled all the gas to the center. Eventually because of all the gas it became so hot there that some hydrogen atoms fused together to make helium.
As they did this a lot of energy was let out. All this energy eventually made the Sun. The leftover gas and dust made the planets, their moons, asteroids and all other objects in the Solar System.
