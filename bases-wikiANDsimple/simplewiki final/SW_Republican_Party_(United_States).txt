The United States Republican Party is one of the two biggest political parties in the United States of America. The other large party is the Democratic Party. The United States also has many other small parties known as third parties.
The Republican National Committee coordinates most of the activities of the Republican Party in all 50 states.
The Republicans are often called "the right" or "conservatives". The Republican Party itself is also known as the G.O.P., which stands for "Grand Old Party."
The symbol of the republican party is the elephant. This symbol was first used in 1874 in a political cartoon "(pictured)".
Traditionally, the Republican Party has supported conservative causes, and has wanted to lower taxes and to make the government smaller.
