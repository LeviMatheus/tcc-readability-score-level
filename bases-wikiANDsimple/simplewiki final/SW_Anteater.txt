Anteaters are mammals of the family "Myrmecophagidae" and the suborder "Vermilingua". Anteaters live in South America and Central America.
Anteaters eat ants, just like the name says. They eat termites, too. The anteater has long, sharp claws and a long, sticky tongue. The tongue can be up to 60 cm long, as long as a person's arm. The anteater opens an ant nest with its claws. Then it licks up the ants with its tongue.
