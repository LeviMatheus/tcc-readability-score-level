Mosses are non-vascular plants. They grow in forests and on logs. They live where it is cool and wet. Because they lack a circulatory system, and therefore the means to transport nutrients around their structures, they cannot grow very large.
A moss does not make seeds. A moss does not have fruit. When a moss grows, it makes tiny spores instead. The spores are like dust. They come from a little box that grows up out of the moss. The box has a lid that falls off. Then the spores come out and float away. They will make more moss.
