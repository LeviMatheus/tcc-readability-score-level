A shop, also spelled shoppe, is a store where people can go to buy items that they need or want. People might go to a shop to buy food, clothes, furniture or many other things.
People might also go to a repair shop if something is broken, and they want the shop to fix it. For example, someone might bring a broken bicycle to a bicycle repair shop.
