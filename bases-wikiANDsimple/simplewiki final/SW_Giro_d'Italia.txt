The Giro d'Italia, or Tour of Italy, is a famous bicycle race held in Italy, every spring. It is one of the most famous, and best paid bicycle races. The first race was in 1909. It started because the editor of a newspaper called "La Gazzetta dello Sport" wanted more people to read his newspaper. He planned a race similar to the Tour de France, which had started in 1903.
The leader of the race wears a pink jersey (called the "maglia rosa". This is because pink is the colour of "La Gazzetta dello Sport". The leader of the mountain climbing competition wears a green jersey (called the "maglia verde"), and the leader of the sprinters' competition wears a mauve jersey (called the "maglia ciclamino"). The leader of the young rider's competition wears a white jersey (called the "maglia bianca"). This is the same as the young riders' competition in the Tour de France.
