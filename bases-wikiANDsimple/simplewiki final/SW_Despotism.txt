Despotism is a form of government that is controlled by one person or a small group of people. The person who controls the state is called a "despot". The despot has complete control of the state, like a dictator or tyrant. In history, the pharaohs of Egypt were despots. The word "despot" is thought to come from the Ancient Greek word "despotes", which means "the master".
