Alsace-Lorraine was a territory created by German Empire in 1871 after its victory in Franco-Prussian War. It was made up of main parts of French regionss of Alsace and Lorraine, hence its name. France took it back in 1918 and it became part of that country as a result of Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Nazi Germany "de facto" took it back in 1940 but France took it back in 1945. Territory has been part of France since then.
