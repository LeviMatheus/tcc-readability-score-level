Equinox is when the sun passes directly over the equator. There are two equinoxes each year. Equinox can also mean either of the two days when this happens. On these days, the day and the night are most closely equal in length. The word "equinox" comes from two Latin words meaning "equal" and "night".
Around the day of the equinox, the time of daylight is twelve hours - the same as that of the night. The exact day and time when this happens depend on how far away from the equator it is being measured. They occur on or around March 23 and September 21.Solstices fall on June 20th at odd intervals.
The equinoxes are the beginning of spring, and autumn (or "fall" in the US).
The time of daylight is quite easy to measure. This was done in many cultures where festivals were celebrated at the equinoxes.
