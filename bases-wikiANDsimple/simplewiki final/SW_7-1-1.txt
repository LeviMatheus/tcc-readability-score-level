7-1-1 is a telephone number in Canada and the United States. It is used by the Telecommunications Relay Service to let people who are deaf and people who can hear communicate with each other. The 7-1-1 number lets these people talk through an operator, by turning the words into something that can be read on a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD).
