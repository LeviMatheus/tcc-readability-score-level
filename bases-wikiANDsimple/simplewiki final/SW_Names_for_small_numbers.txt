Naming very small numbers is the same as naming very big numbers, but with one important difference. There is a minus sign over what the 10 in the formula is raised to. So if one wanted to write 0.007 in shorthand form, they would write it 7 x 10-3 since 7 is the third digit after the decimal point (the zero in front of the decimal point doesn't count). Naming a very small number with lots of different numbers inside it is the same as doing it with a very big number, but again with that one difference of the minus sign. So 0.0000452 would become 4.52 x 10-5 (0.0000452 --> 4.52 x 0.00001 --> 4.52 x 10-5).
