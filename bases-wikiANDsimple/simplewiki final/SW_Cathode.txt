A cathode is an electrode through which positive electric current flows out of a polarized electrical device. In other words, a cathode is negative electrode. An electrode through which current flows the other way into the device is termed an anode.
In physics, chemistry or electronics, a cathode is an electrode that emits electrons into the device. Reduction occurs at the cathode in an electrolyte, which electricity can pass through.
