Woolfardisworthy is a village in the Torridge district in the English county of Devon.
The name of the village is a local curiosity, as its pronunciation (and occasional spelling) differs to how one may try to pronounce it. On local signs, the village is sometimes marked as Woolsery alongside the original name. This is due to the pronunciation of the village's name being /ˈwʊlzərɨ/ ("Woolz'ry").
There is another (smaller) village of the same name in the Mid Devon district.
