William de Wiveleslie Abney (July 24, 1843 - December 3, 1920) was an English astronomer, chemist, and photographer. Abney was a member of many scientific organizations.
He was best known for his discovering and measuring the effect of adding white to a hue, in 1910. The effect is generally known as the Abney effect. For example, adding white to red makes it slightly bluish (bluish red is known as pink), and adding white to yellowish green hues makes them less yellowish and thus greener.
