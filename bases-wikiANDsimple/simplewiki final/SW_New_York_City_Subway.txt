The New York City Subway is a rapid transit system that is in New York City, United States. It is one of the biggest rapid transit systems in the world, with 468 stations. It has 229 miles (or 369 km) of routes on 656 miles (or 1056 km) of track. The New York City Subway never closes; the trains are always working.
The first trains started working on October 9 1863 and the first underground trains started working on October 27 1904. The IRT main line, which is considered to be the first New York City "subway" line, opened in 1904; however, the Ninth Avenue Line, a predecessor elevated railroad line, operated its first trial run on July 3, 1868. and the West End Line railroad opened in 1863. A small portion of the latter line's original right-of-way is still in daily use near Coney Island.
Subway stations.
There are subway stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and The Bronx. About 40% of the tracks are above ground and the other 60% are below ground. Every day people take about 5,076,000 rides on the subway.
Fares.
The subway started using MetroCards in 1994. Riders can buy MetroCards from the station booth or from vending machines that are in the stations.
SmartLink cards are another kind of card that riders can use to pay for rides on the subway. These cards will replace the MetroCards one day.
Safety.
Riders are not allowed to take pictures with cameras that flash or with cameras that are on tripods.
Subway police can search riders to make sure they do not have weapons or other items that could be used to hurt other people.
When riders get hurt, usually it is because they slip when they are getting in the train. This is because there is a small gap between the train and the platform. In recent times, workers have made the gaps smaller to prevent people from slipping.
