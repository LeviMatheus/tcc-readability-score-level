The Georgian alphabet is used to write in the Georgian language and other Kartvelian languages. The alphabet is called Mkhedruli, first said around in the 11th century.
Greek and Aramaic influences have been shown, but some Georgian scholars like Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze have said that they were freely invented in imitation of the Greek model rather than directly based upon earlier forms of the Aramaic alphabet even though the Georgian phonological inventory is very different from Greek.
