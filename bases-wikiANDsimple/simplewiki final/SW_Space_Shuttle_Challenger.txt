Space Shuttle "Challenger" was a spaceship used by NASA to fly into outer space. The shuttle broke up 73 seconds after take-off on 28 January 1986 See [Space Shuttle Challenger Disaster]. All seven people who were on it at the time were killed. The crash happened because a rubber tube called an o-ring did not expand to fill a gap in one of the booster rockets, due to cold weather.
