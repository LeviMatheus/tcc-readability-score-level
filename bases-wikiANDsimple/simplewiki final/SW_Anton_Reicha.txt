Anton Reicha (born 26 February 1770; died 28 May 1836) was a Czech-born composer who became naturalized French. He was a lifelong friend of Beethoven.
Reicha is now best remembered for the large number of quintets that he wrote for wind instruments, and for his work as a music teacher. Franz Liszt and Hector Berlioz were both pupils of Reicha. Reicha wrote several books about music theory and composition.
