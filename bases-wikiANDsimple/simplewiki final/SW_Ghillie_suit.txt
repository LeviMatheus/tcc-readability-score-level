A ghillie suit is a special kind of camouflage suit used by snipers. It is made of netting, with woven threads of burlap, yute, and other fibers in to help hide the sniper's body outline. Ghillie suits are heavy, usually weighing 3-10 pounds or more, and can become very hot. They also can catch on objects when used in the woods and make movement difficult. Still, they are one of the best kinds of camouflage a sniper can use. With a properly made ghillie suit that matches the terrain around him, a sniper can be almost invisible, even to a soldier right next to him.
