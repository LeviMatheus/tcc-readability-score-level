The Deccan Plateau is a large plateau in India which covers the majority of the southern part of the country. It is located between three mountain ranges and extends over eight Indian states; in particular the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau.
The plateau covers 4,21,000 sq. km., 43 percent of India's landmass.
The uplands, areas of higher land, make up a triangle nested within the familiar downward-pointing triangle of the Indian sub-continent's coastline. In the south of India the plateau is mostly over 1,000 metres (m) above sea level. In the north it is mostly about 500 m above sea level.
The plateau is very big and there are many habitats: different Ecosystems with different sorts of vegetation, climate, geology and animals. The forests on the plateau are older than the Himalayan mountains.
On the west of the plateau are the Western Ghats and in the east are the Eastern Ghats. These mountain ranges rise from their respective nearby coastal plains and nearly meet at the southern tip of India. The mountains make the southward-pointing vertex of a triangle. The northern boundary of the triangle is made up by the Satpura Range and Vindhya Range. These northern ranges separate the plateau from the heavily populated riverine plains of northern India.
Etymology.
The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word "dakkhin". That word comes from the Sanskrit word "dakṣiṇa-" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.
