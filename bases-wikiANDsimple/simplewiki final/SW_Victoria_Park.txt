Victoria Park is a football stadium in the town of Dingwall, Ross-shire, Scotland. It is the home stadium of Ross County F.C. who play in the Scottish First Division.
There are two stands, the West and East Stands, which have covered seats and two standing-only terraces known as the Academy End and Jailend. It has a total capacity of 5800 (2590 seated), so does not meet Scottish Premier League standards.
The Highland Football Academy is behind the Academy End and an "Astroturf" (fake grass) pitch is next to the East Stand. To date, the board have spent more than Â£3.5 million on renovating the stadium and plans are being made to create a modern all-seater stadium suitable for the Premier League.
The stadium holds more people than the town of Dingwall, which had a population of 5,026 at the last census.
