Cheeks are the area of the face under the eyes and between the nose and the ears.
It is fleshy in humans and mammals, the skin being held up by the chin and the jaws, and making the wall of the human mouth, touching the cheekbone below the eye.
In animals, markings on the cheek area (i.e. stripes/spots), often are features between species or individuals.
