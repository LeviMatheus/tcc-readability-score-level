The Roman province of Dacia on the Balkans included the modern Romanian regions of Transylvania, Banat and Oltenia, and temporarily Muntenia and southern Moldova, but not the nearby regions of Moesia. It was added to the Roman empire in its earliest days under the war of conquest by the Emperor Trajan, and was ironically—considering its wealth— the first of the Roman provinces from which Rome withdrew.
