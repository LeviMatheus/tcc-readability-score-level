The Teutonic Knights is a Roman Catholic military order. Started at the end of the 12th century in Acre, Palestine, during the Crusades. The Teutonic Knights are now a clerical order based in Vienna, Austria.
In 1226 Konrad of Masovia brought Teutonic Knights to fight against pagan Prussians. They did it quickly and knights started to be danger for weak then Poland. At last, the power of Teutonic Order was crushed in Battle of Tannenberg in 1410.
