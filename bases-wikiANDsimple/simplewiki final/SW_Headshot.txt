In video games a headshot is when a player or an enemy gets hit in their head. It is often attempted when using a sniper rifle. As the head is the smallest part of the body, scoring headshots is often considered a skill in the video game community. The term may have started with the game Unreal Tournament, where a commentator shouts loudly 'Headshot!' everytime a player was shot in the head.
