The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol is a protocol related to computers and networks. Very often it is abbreviated to DHCP.It was made so that computers could get access to the network automatically. To be able to access the Internet (or any computer network), an address is needed. The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol allows for this address to be obtained automatically. Other data, like a DNS Nameserver, or a time server can also be obtained that way. Finally, computers that support it, can even get a disk image they boot from over the network.
The address can be dynamic (it can change), or it can be static (it stays the same). After a certain time, the address lease has to be renewed.
