The station was converted to a premium station in 1996, and has a small kiosk and a staffed ticket office. Actually situated in West Melbourne, the station's main entrance, at its east, is at intersection of Ireland Street and Railway Place. The station also has a western exit however this leads only to the rail yards.
The number 216 and 219 buses stop nearby the station.
Redevelopment.
On May 15, 2006, it was announced that the station is to be redeveloped. As part of the project, a new main entrance will be created at the southern end of the station with new escalators, stairs and lifts installed for quicker access to other platforms and to help disabled passengers. The total cost of the redevelopment will be $36 million dollars. Prior to the Victorian State election in 2006, Department of Infrastructure signs outside North Melbourne railway station indicated that the redevelopment would be complete by 2008. Recent amendments to the signs have seen this date revised to 2010.
