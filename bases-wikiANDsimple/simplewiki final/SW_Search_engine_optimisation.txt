Search engine optimisation is a set of techniques to make webpages appear in the search engines results pages (SERPS) such as those given by google. Many people use search engine optimisation companies to do the work for them because it is too time consuming to do themselves.
A more common word used to describe search engine optimisation is internet marketing or search engine marketing.
Search engine companies are careful to ensure that spam does not affect their search engine results pages by incorporating filters such as pagerank.
Most people do not need to pay for search engine optimisation services because usually a webpage is supposed to appear on the search engines over time anyway. But some ecommerce websites may want to appear sooner, and so they pay for search engine optimisation services from companies that provide it.
