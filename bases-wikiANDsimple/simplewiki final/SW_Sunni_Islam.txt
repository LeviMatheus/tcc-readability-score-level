Sunni Muslims are the largest denomination of the Islamic religion. They are referred to as Ahl ul-Sunna (Arabic: أهل السنة; "people of the tradition"). The word Sunni comes from the word sunna (Arabic: سنة), which means the tradition of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad. Sunnis are also called "Ahlu s-Sunna wa-l-Jama'ah" (Arabic: أهل السنة والجماعة) (people of tradition and congregation), meaning that the Sunnis are united. They are the branch of Islam that came through the caliphate, which started with Abu Bakr.
