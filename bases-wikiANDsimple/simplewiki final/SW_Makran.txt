Makran (Urdu: مکران) is a partly-desert coastal strip in the south of Balochistan, in Iran and Pakistan, along the coast of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman. The Persian phrase "Mahi khoran", fish-eaters ("Mahi" = fish + "khor" = eat) is believed to be the origin of the modern word "Makran".
The narrow coastal plain rises very rapidly into several mountain ranges. The coastline is 1,000km, 750km of this is in Pakistan. The climate is very dry with very little rainfall.
