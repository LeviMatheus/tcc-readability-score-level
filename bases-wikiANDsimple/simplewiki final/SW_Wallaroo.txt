A wallaroo is a macropod with its size between the big kangaroos and the small wallabies. The name "wallaroo" is a mix of wallaby and kangaroo. Most wallaroos are smaller than a kangaroo, and are found in open, rocky country. Wallaroo means "rock kangaroo". There are 3 types of wallaroo. They all stand the same way: wrists raised, elbows close into the body, and shoulders back, and all have a large, black nose.
"Macropus robustus", called the Eastern Wallaroo, Common Wallaroo or just Wallaroo lives on the sides of the Great Dividing Range (which runs for more than 3,000 km along the eastern and south-eastern coast of Australia). There are four subspecies: the Eastern Wallaroo and the Euro, which are both widespread across Australia. Two others live in small areas only, one from Barrow Island, the other from the Kimberley area of Western Australia.
The Woodward's Wallaroo or Black Wallaroo ("Macropus bernardus") lives in steep, rocky ground in Arnhem Land. Between 60 to 70 cm in length (without tail) it is the smallest wallaroo and the most heavily built. Males weigh 19 to 22 kg, females about 13 kg.
The Antilopine Wallaroo ("Macropus antilopinus") also called the Antilopine Kangaroo is different to other wallaroos. It is, more like the Eastern and Western Grey Kangaroos. It lives in groups on the grassy plains and woodlands, where the other wallaroos live by themselves.
