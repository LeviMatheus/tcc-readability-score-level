A dictatorship is a country where one person has the power to do whatever he or she wants. The ruler is called a dictator. In a dictatorship, people usually do not have many rights or much freedom.
A dictatorship that is ruled by soldiers is called a military dictatorship or junta. A monarchy (the system where there are Kings and Queens) is not usually called a dictatorship.
