Madness (or Insanity) is a word people use to describe different diseases of the mind. Usually, such people need to be cared for by specially trained personnel. It can also refer to anger.
People who are mad (or insane) usually have a hard time telling right from wrong. In most countries, being able to tell if something is wrong is the basis for criminal law. Mad people can therefore not commit crimes in such countries.
An animal can also be called mad, if that animal suffers from rabies.
