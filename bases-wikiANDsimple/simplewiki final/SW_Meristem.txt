A meristem is a tissue in all plants that consists of meristematic cells. These are cells that have not yet a special function. They are found in zones of the plant where growth can take place.
Plant cells with special functions (differentiated cells) generally cannot divide or produce cells of a different type. Therefore, cell division in the meristem is necessary to get new cells for expansion and differentiation of tissues and to create new organs, that are necessary for the basic structure of the plant body.
Meristematic cells have the same function for plants as stem cells have for animals. They are incompletely or not at all differentiated, and are capable of continued cellular division (youthful). And the cells are small and protoplasm fills the cell completely. The vacuoles are extremely small.
Maintenance of the cells needs a balance between two antagonistic processes: organ initiation and stem cell population renewal.
Primary meristems.
These meristems are responsible for primary growth, or an increase in length or height.
