Cienfuegos (Spanish for "hundred fires") is one of the provinces of Cuba. The capital city of the province is also called Cienfuegos and was founded by French settlers in 1819.
Cienfuegos is the smallest province in Cuba. With the exception of the Sierra de Escambray, Cienfuegos is low lying with an economy almost entirely dedicated to the growing and processing of sugar. Sugar mills and sugarcane plantations dot the landscape. There are waterfalls in the sierra of the province.
Scuba diving off Cienfuegos province is extremely popular both with tourists and locals. There are numerous underwater caves, and well over 50 dive sites in the province.
The provinces of Cienfuegos, Sancti Sp√≠ritus, and Villa Clara were once all part of the now defunct province of Santa Clara.
