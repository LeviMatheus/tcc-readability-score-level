"Sola scriptura" (Latin for "by scripture alone") means "The Bible only". The Protestants believed that they should only read the Bible to find out what God wants them to believe. They did this instead of listening to the Pope or the Priests in the Roman Catholic Church.
"Sola scriptura" was a principle of the Protestant Reformation of the reformer Martin Luther and is a principle of Protestants today (see Five solas).
