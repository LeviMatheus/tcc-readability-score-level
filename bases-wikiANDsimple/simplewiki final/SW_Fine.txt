The word fine is used in English with two very different meanings.
1) People sometimes use the word fine as an adjective to mean that something is good.
2) We also use the word fine as a noun with a different meaning. Often, if a court or a judge says that someone did a crime, then the person has to pay some money to their government. This money is called a fine. Governments make these fines so people won't want to do the crime.
Sometimes we often use the word "fine" in the same way for businesses instead of governments. For example there are some businesses that will let us take books or videos to use in our homes for a few days. But if we keep the book or video for too long, we might have to pay a fine to that business.
