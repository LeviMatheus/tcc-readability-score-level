Infantry is the branch of a country's army that is trained to fight and kill enemy soldiers. A member of the infantry is called an "infantryman". Historically, infantrymen were trained to use spears, swords and shields. Modern infantrymen are trained to use many different kinds of weapons, including rifles, grenades, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, and machine guns. It is one of the most dangerous jobs in any country's military.
