Sarasvati is one of the goddesses of Hindus. The Vedas also mention her name. She is the goddess of speech, learning and knowledge. The legend states that she created the Sanskrit language and invented the vina, a musical instrument similar to a lute. The legend also says that she is the wife of Brahma, one of the gods of the Hindus.
Generally, an image or icon of Sarasvati shows her with four arms. Two arms hold the vina. In other arms she holds a book and a lotus flower.
