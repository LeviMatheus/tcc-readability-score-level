Research is the process of finding facts. These facts will lead to knowledge. Research is done by using what is already known. Additional knowledge can be obtained by proving (or falsifying) existing theories or systems, and by trying to better explain observations. Research is an analytical, systematic, organized and objective process. This process should answer a question or hypothesis. In this way, it should increase the knowledge and information on a certain unknown thing which people wish to know better.
Academic research.
Students do research to write papers. Reading a large number of books about a subject, and taking notes, is a form of research. Authors of nonfiction books do research so that their books will be correct.
Scientific research.
The Scientific method is a common way to do research. Research is used to improve understanding of Biology, Engineering, Physics, Chemistry and many other fields. This makes it possible to discover new medicines, to make automobiles safer, and to make farms produce more food. Money for research comes from governments, private corporations, and charities.
