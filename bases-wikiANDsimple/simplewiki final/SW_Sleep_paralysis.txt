Sleep paralysis is a condition. It happens when people are waking up from sleeping. It means that for a short time, people are paralysed (unable to move). Usually it does not last long, only minutes.
Sometimes people may also get it before they fall asleep.
Possible causes.
Little is known about the physiology of sleep paralysis. However, some have suggested that it may be linked to post-synaptic inhibition of nerves in the pons region of the brain. In particular, low levels of melatonin may stop the depolarization current in the nerves, which prevents the stimulation of the muscles.
There is also a significant positive correlation between those experiencing this disorder frequently and those suffering from narcolepsy. However, various studies suggest that many or most people will experience sleep paralysis at least once or twice in their lives.
