A solstice is when the Earth is the most tilted.
The June Solstice is when the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere this is called the Summer Solstice. The June Solstice is usually on June 21.
The December Solstice is when the Southern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted toward the Sun and the Northern Hemisphere of the Earth is tilted away from the Sun. In the Northern Hemisphere this is called the Winter solstice. The December Solstice is usually on December 21.
While the exact causes were long unknown, the effect (of days getting shorter or longer) was soon recognised in many ancient cultures. Many of the pre-Christian cultures, like the druidic, the Germanic and the Norse faith therefore celebrated these events as holidays.
When the importance of the old faiths vanished, the Christian creed took over some of the festivities, which were then carried out in the honour of a new patron. The date of Christmas in the Catholic and Protestant faith is just 3 days away from the December solistice.
Today, many people still celebrate the solstices as holidays.
