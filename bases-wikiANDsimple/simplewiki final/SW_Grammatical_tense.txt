Some languages have all three tenses, some have only two, and some have no tenses at all. English and Japanese for example have only two common tenses: past and present. Chinese and Indonesian verbs do not show tense. Instead they use other words in the sentence to show when the verb happens.
Popular ideas of tense.
Many people think that "tense" means any verb form or even certain combinations of auxiliary verbs and other verbs. For example, many people say that "will go" is future tense or that "He is loved by many" is passive tense. This is not technically correct.
