Knowles re-recorded the song for her debut solo album, "Dangerously in Love" (2003), under the title "Dangerously in Love 2". Featuring a modified arrangement and background vocals by Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, Knowles's version received a generally positive response from music critics. In the U.S. the song went for radio airplay only and was never released as a single in other countries. No music video exists for the song, though the performance on her DVD "Live at Wembley" was shown frequently on BET.
Knowles frequently performs the song live — often as a prelude to "Crazy in Love", and more recently with her live cover of the Jill Scott song "He Loves Me" — often to show her vocal power and range. She performed "Dangerously in Love 2" at the 2004 Grammy Awards, where it won in the category of "Best Female R&B Vocal Performance".
Other versions of the Knowles solo version of the song include an a cappella, an instrumental and the Svella remix.
