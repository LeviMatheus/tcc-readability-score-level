Berlei is a brand of women's underwear and in particular bras and girdles
The brand started in Australia in 1917
Berlei bras are now sold in Australia by Pacific Brands and in the United Kingdom by Courtaulds Textiles.
The name came from that of the firm's founder, Frederick R. Burley, who felt that his name as normally spelled was not appropriate to his products.
Berlei Limited was one of the first Australian companies to expand outside Australia. Berlei (New Zealand) Limited was incorporated in 1923 and Berlei (U.K.) Limited was organised in 1930.
