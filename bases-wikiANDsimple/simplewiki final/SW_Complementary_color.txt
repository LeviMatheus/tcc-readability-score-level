Complementary colours are pairs of opposite colours. What is meant by "opposite" can be different between colour science, and art and the printing process.
Afterimages.
If a person stares at a single colour for about a minute then looks at a white surface, an afterimage of the complementary colour will appear. This is because of "eye fatigue". The photoreceptors (cells in the eye which catch coloured light) for red light in the retina (the back part of the eye) are fatigued. When photoreceptor are fatigued they are less able to send information to the brain. When the person looks at white light information of the others colour gets through normally and the illusion of viewing the complementary colour is created.
Art and design.
The complement of each primary colour (red, blue, or yellow) is roughly the colour made by mixing the other two in a subtractive system (red + blue = purple; blue + yellow = green; red + yellow = orange). When two complements are mixed they produce a grey or brown.
The use of complementary colours is an important aspect of art and graphic design. This also extends to other fields such as contrasting colours in logos and retail display. When placed next to each other, complements make each other appear brighter. On an artistic colour wheel, complementary colours are placed opposite one another. Although these artistic complements may not be precise complements under the scientific definition, most artistic colour wheels are laid out roughly like the HSV colour wheel discussed above.
