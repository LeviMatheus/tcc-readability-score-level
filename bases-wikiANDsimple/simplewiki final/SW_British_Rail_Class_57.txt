The British Rail Class 57 diesel locomotives were introduced by Brush Traction between 1997-2004. They are rebuilds, with new engines, of former Class 47 locomotives, originally introduced in 1964-5. They are known as "bodysnatchers", or "Zombies" to enthusiasts, by virtue of the fact that the shell (body) of the class 47 has been stripped, rewired and re-engined.
