World Championship Wrestling (known better by its abbreviation WCW) was a professional wrestling company that went out of business in 2001 when it was purchased by what was then the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) (now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)) and it's owner Vince McMahon. Within 3 weeks of the purchase the infamous storyline called "The Invasion" started. The storyline centered around WCW trying to take over the WWF and put the WWF out of business. In storyline, the owner of WCW was Vince's son Shane McMahon.
