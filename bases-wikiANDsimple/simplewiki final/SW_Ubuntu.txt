Ubuntu is a free operating system that uses the Linux kernel. The word "ubuntu" is an old African word meaning "humanity." It is pronounced "oo-boon-too."
It is one of the most popular Linux distributions and it is based on Debian Linux. An idea behind Ubuntu is to make it easy to use and install onto a computer. Ubuntu can be used on all types of systems like Macs and PCs. Ubuntu is downloaded as a CD, which is free to download on the Ubuntu website. It can be installed or tested by running the CD.
Started in 2004, Ubuntu has been developed at a fast rate by Canonical Ltd., a company owned by a wealthy South African man by the name of Mark Shuttleworth. Because there are several options for which desktop environment to use, Ubuntu was split into four different packages: Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Xubuntu, and Edubuntu.
Packages and Software support.
Free software here includes only software that meets the Ubuntu licensing requirements, which almost are the same to the Debian Free Software Guidelines. There is one difference for the Main category, however â€” it has firmware and fonts which cannot be changed, but are included if Ubuntu won't work right.
Non-free software is usually unsupported (Multiverse), but some exceptions (Restricted) are given for very important non-free software. Supported non-free software include device drivers that are needed to run Ubuntu on current hardware. The level of support in the Restricted category is less than that of Main, since the developers may not be able to get to the source code. It is wanted that Main and Restricted should contain all the software needed for a general-use Linux system.
Besides the official repositories is "Ubuntu Backports", which is an officially known project to backport newer software from later versions of Ubuntu. The repository is not comprehensive (meaning that it has parts missing from it); it is made up of mostly of user-requested packages, which are accepted if they meet quality guidelines.
