A new town, planned community, or planned city is a kind of city that is designed by architects and engineers before it is built. Most cities and towns just develop over the years, without a clear plan. Planned community neighborhoods are designed with separate districts of the city for parks, stores, homes, and offices. Planned communities have a transportation system for commuters.
