A stoat is a small mammal of the family Mustelidae. Males are bigger than females. They are also called ermines. Stoats can grow to be as long as 30 centimeters. It eats meat, eggs, and can kill animals bigger than it. It will store food for later. It kills by biting at the place where the skull attaches to the rest of the body, killing the brain stem.
Stoats are good at climbing trees. Stoats are long and thin with short legs, small ears, and thick warm fur. Their fur is brown, but changes to white in the winter. The tail has a black tip all year round. Stoats have a good sense of smell, and they talk and hunt using smell. They do not see color as well as humans, but they can see better at night. They sleep during the day and are awake at night; this is called nocturnal. Like a skunk, stoats can spray a bad smelling fluid when they are scared.
Stoats live in temperate, subarctic northern areas. They live in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. They also live in New Zealand because people brought them there. In New Zealand, they are considered bad.
Stoats live alone and are territorial. They mate once a year and have several babies. The males do not help raise the babies. The female is pregnant for 11 months, which is a long time for such a small mammal.
