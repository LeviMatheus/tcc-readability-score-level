A predator is a kind of animal that hunts, catches and eats other animals. For example, a spider eating a fly caught at its web is a predator, or a pack of lions eating a buffalo. The animals that the predator hunts is usually called prey.
Predators are usually carnivores (meat-eaters) or omnivores (eats plants and other animals). Predators will hunt other animals for food. Examples for predators are lions, tigers, Leopards, crocodiles, snakes,
eagles, wolves, killer whales, and sharks.
Predators are usually defined as animals that eat other animals. But to some scientists, the word predator means an animal or any living organism that eats anything. A cow eating grass will be a predator of that grass. Plants are not predators because they make their own food.
