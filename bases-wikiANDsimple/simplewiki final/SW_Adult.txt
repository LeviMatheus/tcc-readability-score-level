An adult is someone grown up completely, or mature. It is the phase after being a teenager.
In many countries (such as the United States) someone is considered an adult when he or she is older than 18 years.
But there are exceptions, like Japan and South Korea, which do not consirder a person to be an adult until he or she is 19 or 20 years old.
There are also some cultures that say a person is an adult from an age of 12 years on.
