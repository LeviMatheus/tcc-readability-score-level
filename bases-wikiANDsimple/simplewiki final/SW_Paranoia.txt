Paranoia is a condition where a person believes that they are being watched at all times, for example, or that they are being followed. They may also think that someone who is not present, loves them. Often this is a figure well-known in the media.
Very often, the symptoms of the disease are also present with other diseases of the mind, for example with Schizophrenia.
When normal people who are not doctors talk about someone being paranoid, they usually do not mean this person they refer to is mentally ill. They just see that the person has strong fears, for example.
