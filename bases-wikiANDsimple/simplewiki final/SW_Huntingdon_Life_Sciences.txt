Huntingdon Life Sciences (HLS) are the largest animal testing company in Europe. They are based in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom. They also have a laboratory in New Jersey, America. It is estimated that around 500 animals are killed at HLS in the UK every day. The UK lab carries out medical and product research for many organisations.
Many people feel strongly against HLS. The Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty (SHAC) campaign group are the main opposition group. SHAC were set up in 1999. The opposition to HLS has had many forms. While most animal rights people have used legal means of protest, some people have become extremists and done very bad things. Thus the opposition to HLS has become an example to many people of a good cause gone wrong.
