The seminal vesicles are a pair of tube-like glands. They are found behind the bladder of males. They make a large most of the content of semen (also called seminal fluid). About 70% of the seminal fluid in humans comes from the seminal vesicles.
Anatomy.
Both vesicles are about 5 cm in length, but it is curled up. Each gland makes a ball shape on the wall of each vas deferens. There is a tube linking the seminal glands which opens into the vas deferens and prostate gland.
Use.
The seminal vesicles make most of semen, but during ejaculation, most of the ejaculate has sperm rather than semen in it. The use of seminal fluid isn't known, since sperm don't move or survive well in semen. Some think that it acts as a fluid to stop sperm from another male impregnating the female so that the children of only one male can survive.
Seminal fluid has proteins, enzymes, fructose, mucus, vitamin C and flavins. The fructose gives sperm energy and 'food'.
