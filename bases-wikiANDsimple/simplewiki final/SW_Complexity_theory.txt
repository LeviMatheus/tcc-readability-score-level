Complexity theory is a branch of Computer science. It looks at how hard a problem (an algorithm) is to do for a computer. There are different layers, which can be considered. An algorithm may be faster than some other algorithm, but it may need more resources, like memory. Most of the time, the running behaviour is looked at in a worst-case scenario. Sometimes people are also interested in how a certain algorithm does on average, because the worst case scenario is very unlikely to occur.
