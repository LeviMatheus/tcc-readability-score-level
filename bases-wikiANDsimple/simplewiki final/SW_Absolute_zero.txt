In physics, absolute zero is the temperature where the particles of matter stop moving. Absolute zero is impossible to achieve, because all particles move, even if it's just a small vibration. There are many people who have gotten very close to absolute zero, but the record temperature was 100 PK (Picokelvin) above absolute zero reported in the Helsinki University of Technology in 2000.
The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins (K) or 0 degrees Rankine (°R). The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is −273.15 °C or −459.67 °F.
At this stage the pressure of the particles is zero. If we plot a graph to it, we can see that the temperature of the particles is zero. The temperature cannot decrease any further. The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero, the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity better.
