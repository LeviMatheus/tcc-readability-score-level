Evil means anything which is bad or wrong. It is the opposite of good. People usually say that an action which hurts people or breaks certain rules is evil. However, a person or a group that does evil things can also be called evil.
In theology, there is a big question: "If there is a God, why does God let evil happen?" Some think that evil proves that there is not a God. Others think that God lets evil happen so that people can choose "not" to do evil.
The study of good and evil in philosophy is called ethics. Ethics tries to explain why some actions are good and other actions are evil. It gives all kinds of answers for how to tell evil from good.
