The aodai ("áo dài") is the national costume of Vietnam for women. Vietnamese wear aodai for formal occasions, at school or for work. The aodai is found in every part of Vietnam and in overseas Vietnamese communities.
A modern aodai has two parts: a high collar, long, loosely fitting dress; and a trousers which reach to ankles. Aodais may have colorful designs with flowers, birds, and pictures. The equivalent garment for men is called an "áo gấm". Because tunics are usually made of transparent fabrics, people who wear ao dai should wear underwear.
The price of an aodai is reasonable, but may be expensive depending on fabrics.
