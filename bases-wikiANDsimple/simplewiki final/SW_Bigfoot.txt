Bigfoot, also called Sasquatch, is a rarely-seen Primate living in the United States and Canada. Even though many people claim to have seen a Bigfoot, or seen their tracks, no one has ever captured one, or found a dead body. For this reason, some people don't believe in Bigfoot. Some also believe Bigfoot is a dangerous monster, because of some scary stories told about them. Most people who study Bigfoot, however, agree that the species is probably gentle and intelligent, just like humans.
Bigfoot is said to be very tall, from 7 to 9 feet (about 2 to 2.75 meters) and covered in brown, black, red, or sometimes even white fur or hair. They are said to have very big feet, about 13 inches long (0.3 meters), which is why they are named Bigfoot.
Bigfoots are mostly seen in the forests of the Pacific Northwest, but sometimes people see them in the Great Lakes area, the Midwest, or even in swamps in the Southern United States.
It is thought that Bigfoot may be related to the Yeti of the Himalayas.
Pictures and Films of Bigfoot.
Sometimes, people who see a Bigfoot are able to take a picture or a film of it. The most famous of these is the "Patterson-Gimlin Film." It was named this because the last names of the men who took the film were Patterson and Gimlin. In the film, a large, ape-like creature can be seen walking from a lake to a forest. Because this is the best film so far of a creature that may be a Bigfoot, scientists argue about it a lot. Some think that the creature is a real Bigfoot, while others think that it is just a person in a gorilla costume. Because of this, people have done experiments with men in gorilla costumes who try to move like the creature in the film. So far, none has been able to move just like it.
