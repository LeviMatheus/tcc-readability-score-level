Education is teaching and learning skills and knowledge. Education also means helping people to learn how to do things and encouraging them to think about what they learn. It is also important for educators to teach ways to find and use information.
Through education, the knowledge of a society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. In democracies, through education, children and adults are supposed to learn how to be active and effective citizens.
Types of education.
It is part of the job of an educator, an instructor, teacher, or tutor to create a place for learning. There are many different kinds of education.
Formal education.
Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Formal education begins in elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university.)
Nonformal education.
Nonformal education is sometimes called adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation. In nonformal education an adult (or a youth who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills. Nonformal education can be in small classes or through self study.
Informal education.
There is also informal education. For example, a parent teaches a child how to prepare a meal. Someone can also get an informal education by reading many books from a library. Informal education is when you are not studying in a school and don't use another particular learning method.
Public schooling.
Public schools provide a free education through the government. Parents are free to let their children receive a private education, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some children cannot go to school, because their countries do not make education available, because their families do not have enough money, or because the children have to work.
