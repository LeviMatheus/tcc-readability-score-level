A Christian sermon is a speech that a priest gives during a church service. The purpose of a sermon is to inspire hope in the people that hear it. In the middle of the service the pastor will go in front of the whole congregation or stand in a pulpit and talk about Jesus Christ and eternal life. He will encourage them to be obedient to God and have faith in God's son, and tell them to love one another. A sermon is meant to teach the listeners about God's will. The pastor may also talk about the current problems of the community, and offer a way to solve them. Lately, "children or family masses" such as the 6pm Mass inspire children to love and learn in the ways of Christ. Most priests find that attentions are captured by involving the people of the Church with simple questions.
