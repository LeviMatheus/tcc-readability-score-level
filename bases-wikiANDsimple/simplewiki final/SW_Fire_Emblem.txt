"Fire Emblem" is a series of video games made by Intelligent Systems. Nintendo began publishing the series on the NES console in 1990. Most of the games in the series were released in Japan. The games were released in North America and Europe. The series is a collection of turn-based strategy role-playing games. They used many characters going on a long journey to fight a common enemy.
Gameplay.
In "Fire Emblem", the player moves units across a grid in turns. The player must deal with a challenge with each part in the story, for example, defeating all of the enemy units. A player may choose to fight, move, heal, or visit shops each turn. The battle system is made up of two units fighting each other with their selected weapon. Some weapons are better against others. For example, swords are better against axes. When units defeat others, they gain experience. This experience is used to "level up" the units and makes them stronger. A well known feature in "Fire Emblem" is that when a character is damaged very badly (loses all of their "hit points"), they can never be used in the game again.
Setting.
Each "Fire Emblem" game is mainly set on a fictional continent, or a really large area. Some continents are used in more than one game. Six continents have been used in "Fire Emblem" so far.
Games.
The first six games were made in Japan. The last four were also released in the United States. A few of the games were also released for the Virtual Console on Wii
