Vinegar is a liquid used mostly in cooking. It can be made from wine or other liquids containing alcohol, like cider or fermented fruit juices. Ethanol is oxidized from the liquid, resulting in vinegar.
It can also be made through the use of certain bacteria.
In cooking, it is often used as a condiment to add to salad. To get an Italian-type dressing, vinegar, oil and salt are used.
