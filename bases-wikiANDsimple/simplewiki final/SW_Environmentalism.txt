Environmentalism is both a philosophy and a social movement that is about protecting nature. Environmentalists often talk about threats to the earth from pollution, and overpopulation. Environmentalism is both personal and political. In their own lives, environmentalists do things that are better for the earth, such as recycling, using natural products, and supporting businesses that are environmentally friendly. Politically, they support laws that help the environment, like regulations on pollution.
