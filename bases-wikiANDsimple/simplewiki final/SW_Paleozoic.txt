The Paleozoic (or Paleozoic Era) is s the beginning of an explosion of life forms. The Cambrian Explosion marks the era with thousands of new life forms in the ancient seas. It lasted from about 542 million years ago to about 251 million of years ago, and is divided into six periods. The Paleozoic Era Paleozoic era saw many important events, including the development of most invertebrate groups, life's conquest of land, the evolution of fish, reptiles, insects, and vascular plants, the formation of the supercontinent of Pangea, and no less than two distinct ice ages. The earth rotated faster than it does today so days were shorter, and the nearer moon meant stronger tides.
