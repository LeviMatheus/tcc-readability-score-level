The Punic Wars were a series of three wars fought between Rome and Carthage between 264 and 146 BC, and were probably the largest wars yet of the ancient world. They are known as the "Punic" Wars because the Latin term for Carthaginian was "Punici" (older "Poenici", from their Phoenician ancestry).
The main cause of the Punic Wars was the clash of interests between the existing empire of Carthage and the expanding Roman Republic.
