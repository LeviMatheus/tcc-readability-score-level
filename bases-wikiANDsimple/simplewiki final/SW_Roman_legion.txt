The Roman Legion (from Latin "legio" "military levy, conscription", from "lego" â€” "to collect") is a term that can mean both: the heavy infantry that was the basic military unit of the ancient Roman army in the period of the late Roman Republic and the Roman Empire and with a wider meaning "legio" ("conscription" or "army") in the sense of the entire Roman army.
In the first meaning, it consisted of several cohorts of heavy infantry known as legionaries. It was almost always accompanied by one or more attached units of auxiliaries, who were not Roman citizens and provided cavalry, ranged troops and skirmishers to complement the legion's heavy infantry.
The size of a typical legion varied widely throughout the history of ancient Rome, with complements of 4,200 legionaries in the republican period of Rome (split into 35 maniples of 120 legionaries each), to around 5,500 in the imperial period (split into 10 cohorts of 480 men each, with the first cohort at double strength: the remaining 220 being cavalry -120- and technical staff).
