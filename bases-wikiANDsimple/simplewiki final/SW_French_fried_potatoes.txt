French fried potatoes (also French fries, just fries in North America, chips in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Commonwealth), are a type of food made out of potatoes. The potatoes are cut into thin strips and fried in hot oil. They are eaten with fish, burgers, sausages, pies, or by themselves. Many things can be put on them to make them taste better, such as salt and vinegar, gravy, curry, cheese, ketchup or mayonnaise. They are called flovorments, because they give food flavor.
A "chip shop" is shops which sells cooked chips to take home. They usually also sell fried fish, sausages and pickled onions. Fish and chips is a very popular meal in Great Britain, and other places.
