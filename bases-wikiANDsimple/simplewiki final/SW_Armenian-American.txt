An Armenian-American is an American whose ancestry stems, either wholly or partly, from Armenia. During the United States 2000 Census, 385,488 Americans indicated either full or partial Armenian ancestry.
History.
The first Armenian known to have moved to America was Martin the Armenian. He arrived in Jamestown, Virginia in 1618, when the colony was only eleven years old. Armenians began to arrive in the United States in high numbers in the late 19th century. However, the influx was intensified when over 100,000 Armenian refugees came after World War I to flee theArmenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire.
