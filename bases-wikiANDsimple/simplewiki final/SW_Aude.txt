Early forms of habitation.
A skull has been found, named "Homme de Tautavel" (Tautavel Man). It has been found in a cave on the site named Caune de l'Arago, near Tautavel. The fossils date from between 300.000 and 450.000 years ago. They consist of over 80 fragments; the skull found belonged to a man in his twenties. He was about 1.65 m, and weighted around 45-55 kg. Other remains are two mandibles, belonging to a woman in her fifties, and to a man, about 20-25 years old. It looks like they did not know how to use fire yet. It also looks like they might have been cannibals, or that they preferred to scavenge for food, rather than hunt. Some bones of rhinoceros, horses, wild sheep (called Mouflon), Tahrs (resemble wild goats), Muskox (some kind of bovine), deer, and reindeer have been found in the cave. There is an ongoing debate if this hominian is directly related to the Neanderthal - If they aren't they would be Homines erecti (currently they are classified as H. erectus Tautavelensis). If they are direct predecessors of the Neanderthals, they would be Homo heidelbergensis.
