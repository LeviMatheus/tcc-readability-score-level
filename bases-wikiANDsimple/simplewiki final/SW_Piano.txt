The piano is a type of musical instrument. It is a member of the chord family. Its full name is "Pianoforte", which comes from the Italian words "piano" which means "soft" and "forte" which means "loud".

History.
It is thought that Bartolomeo Cristofori made the first piano in 1709. Pianos used to be less sturdy. When Beethoven was alive, he hit the keys hard enough to break the pianos. After that, piano makers began to make stronger pianos, like the pianos people play today.
The clavichord looks like a piano but it is smaller and has a different sound. It has a small metal piece that hits strings, making a sound. The harpsichord also looks like a piano, but has a different sound. It has quills that pluck the strings to make a sound.
