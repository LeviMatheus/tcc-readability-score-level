Sir Harry Pateshall Colebatch (29 March 1872 â€“ 12 February 1953) was the 12th Premier of Western Australia from 17 April to 17 May 1919. He was from the Nationalist Party. He was Premier for the shortest time in Western Australian history. This was because he was a member of the upper house of Parliament and it was usual for the Premier to be from the lower house. When he could not find a position in the lower house he resigned.
