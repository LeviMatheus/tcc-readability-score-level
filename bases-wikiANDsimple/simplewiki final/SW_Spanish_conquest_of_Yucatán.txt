The Spanish Conquest of Yucatán was the campaign undertaken by the Spanish "conquistadores" against the Late Postclassic Maya states. This part of the conquest and colonization of the Americas began in the early 16th century, but it took more time than the similar campaigns against the Aztec and Inca Empires. It was about 170 years later before the last Maya stronghold fell, that of the Itza capital of Tayasal on Lake Petén Itzá, in 1697. But except for the Petén region and the Guatemalan highlands, the Spanish had control over Yucatán itself already by 1546.
Unlike the campaigns against the Aztec and Inca states, the Maya had no single political center. Therefore the Spanish had to to fight city by city to brake resistance by the indigenous peoples.
In the beginning the "conquistadores" were mainly interested to get as much gold and silver as possible. Because the Maya lands were poor in this respect, they were not very interesting for the Spanish at that stage. But when land workers became important for the colonies, the Spanish turned to the Maya region. That was around the 1520s.
