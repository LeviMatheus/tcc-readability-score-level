Thermodynamics is a branch of physics that studies the movement of heat between different objects. Thermodynamics also studies the change in pressure and volume of objects. It is normally studied by using a branch of mathematics called statistics to look at the motion of particles. Thermodynamics also has 2 main branches called classical thermodynamics and statistical thermodynamics. An important idea in thermodynamics is that of systems. A system is an object or a group of objects that is being studied.
Laws of thermodynamics.
In thermodynamics, there are 4 laws of thermodynamics that say that energy can be moved between two objects in the form of heat.
Uses of thermodynamics.
In the past, thermodynamics was studied to make steam engines work better. Now, ideas from thermodynamics are used in everything from making engines to studying black holes.
