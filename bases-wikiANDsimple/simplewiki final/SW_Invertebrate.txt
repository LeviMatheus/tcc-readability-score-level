Invertebrate is a kind of animal that does not have a spinal column or "backbone". It is the opposite of vertebrate, that means if an animal is not a vertebrate (fish, reptile, amphibian, bird, or mammal), it is an invertebrate.
Insects have no bones, but they have a skeleton on the outside of their bodies that scientists call an exoskeleton. It is like our skin, only it is hard.
Sharks and related skates and rays are vertebrates with cartilage instead of bones.
