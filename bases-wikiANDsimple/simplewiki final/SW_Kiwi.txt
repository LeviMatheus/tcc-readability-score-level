Kiwis are birds from New Zealand. They form the genus "Apteryx" of the family "Apterygidae". There are several species and sub-species of kiwi. The kiwi has become a symbol for New Zealand. People from New Zealand are nicknamed "Kiwis".
Appearance.
They have brown feathers, which almost look like fur, and a long beak. Kiwis cannot fly, and their wings have become so small that they cannot usually be seen. Kiwis cannot see very well, but they can hear and smell very well.
Life.
Kiwis are nocturnal birds. They mostly eat invertebrates, like worms and insects. Kiwis keep a territory in which they live alone or with their mate. In their territory they build several small caves where they sleep, or lay their eggs.
Kiwis are monogamous, the male and female stay together until one of them dies. The male and female live in the same territory and raise their children together.
Female kiwis lay 1-3 eggs. The eggs are the largest compared to the size of the parent of any bird species. Kiwis become mature when they are 2 years old, and they can live to over 20 years old. One kiwi kept in a zoo even reached 35 years old.
