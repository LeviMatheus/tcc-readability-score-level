The Tudor dynasty was a series of kings and queens in England. This line of rulers started in 1485, when Henry VII defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Henry was accepted as the true king. His son was Henry VIII.
The dynasty ended when Queen Elizabeth I died. She had not named a person to be ruler after her death, so her cousin's son took over. He became James I of England, and started the Stuart dynasty.
During the Tudor period, there were many changes in religion. Henry VIII, for example, was a Catholic but behaved like a Protestant as he broke away from the Pope's power and named himself as head of the Church. Edward VI was raised a Protestant, and therefore shut down all Catholic churches. Mary I was a strong Catholic, having been raised in Spain because of her Spanish mother, Catharine of Aragon. She shut down the Protestant churches and burnt approximately 300 people for being Protestant (these were later called martyrs). When Protestant Elizabeth came to the throne, things changed and the Anglican church was introduced. Since then, religion in England has been pretty much calm.
