Chilcotin Plateau Basalts is an area in British Columbia of small flows of melted rock, called lava or magma, about 150 km from the ocean. They go in the same direction as the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt. These flows are thought to be a result of the crust getting bigger behind an area where one block of land slides under another. This happens a lot in lots of place and is called "back-arc extension volcanism". Most volcanoes near Chilcotin blew out lava, or erupted, 6 to 10 million years before now and 2 to 3 million years before now while the eruptions in the Garibaldi volcanic belt were just beginning. There have also been some eruptions not very long ago in a time called the Pleistocene epoch.
