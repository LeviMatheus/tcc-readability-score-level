Physiology is the study of how living things function and the processes involved.
Physiologists study how different parts or organs of an organism work together to achieve a particular function. In human beings, for example, the digestion of food involves the action of hormones and other chemicals produced by the stomach, liver, and pancreas. Muscle contraction occurs through the action of chemical messengers produced by nerves that supply the muscle.
By learning how the body functions normally, physiologists and physicians are better able to understand what happens when organs function abnormally. For example, an understanding of how the thyroid gland functions has helped in the treatment of a condition called goitre. Studies of the circulatory system and of the nervous system have helped physicians understand and treat such illnesses as heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure.
