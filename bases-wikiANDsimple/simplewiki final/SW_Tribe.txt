A tribe is a small group of people who live and work together. A tribe can be a collection of families or may have families and individual people living together.
It is necessary to do work to keep people alive, and a tribe usually divides up the jobs that need to be done amongst themselves.
In today's world people think of tribes as being from a far distant time in the past when people did not live in cities yet and there were no nations. There are still tribal groups in existence all over the world but their numbers are getting smaller and smaller.
