A radian is a unit of measuring angles. It is shown by the symbol "rad" or, less often, c (for circular measure). The radian was once an SI unit, but was done away with in 1995.
Who uses radians?
Most people who do mathematics or physics use radians, rather than degrees, because some kinds of calculations are simpler when using radians rather than degrees.
A "milliradian" is 1/1000 of a radian.
People who look through a telescope or rifle scope often use milliradians to describe distances as seen through the 'scope.
