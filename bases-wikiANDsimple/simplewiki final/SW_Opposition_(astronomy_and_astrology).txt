Opposition is a word used in astronomy and astrology to show when one celestial body is on the opposite side of the sky when viewed from a particular place (usually the Earth). In particular, two planets are in opposition to each other when their ecliptic longitudes differ by 180°.
The symbol of opposition is ☍.
