Rottweilers are large muscular dogs. Their fur is mostly black, with brown on the legs and face. They are excellent guard dogs, as well as herding, and companion dogs.
Behaviour.
Dogs are pack animals. When they feel threatened, they will defend themselves. They will also protect other members of the pack, to a certain extent. How they defend themselves, and how close they feel to the rest of the pack (their owners) depends on the dog race, and on the how they were raised. Since dogs judge dangerous situations differently, they should not be left unattended near a place where people are arguing. They may also judge "unattended" moves of a child as an attack. Therefore dogs should not be left alone near children.
Problems.
There were cases where certain dogs attacked humans; mostly children.
For this reason, breeding certain dogs has been restricted or forbidden.
Germany and France have classified certain dog races as "dangerous". One of these is the Rottweiler. This means that the dogs must be kept on a leash in most cases. Sometimes, a muzzle may be required as well.
