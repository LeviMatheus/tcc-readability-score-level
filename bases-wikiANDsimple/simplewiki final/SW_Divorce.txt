A divorce is the legal end of a marriage. When two people do not want to be married anymore, they can ask the government to be separated. During a divorce, the couple have to decide how to separate any assets that they acquired during the marriage (such as a house, car, furniture, or bonds), and how they share the costs and duties of caring for any children. Many countries have laws and regulations on divorce, and the couple may be required to go to court and appear before a judge or family court.
Impacts.
When a couple gets a divorce, it can be very stressful for both of them; some people become depressed or sad after a divorce. If there are children, the children may also feel sad when the parents are divorced. However, there are many resources that can help people who are divorcing, such as therapists, counsellors, books, and DVDs.
