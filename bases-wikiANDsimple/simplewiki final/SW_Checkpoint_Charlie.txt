Checkpoint Charlie was one of three places where people could travel from the American occupied sectors of Germany and Berlin to the Soviet occupied sectors.
These places were called checkpoints because they were places where passports and identities were checked.
As it was the only crossing point there were sometimes queues of people waiting to cross. But military traffic was never stopped, because Berlin was supposed to be under the control of all four wartime allies.
The Checkpoint today.
After the end of the Cold War, and the reunification of Germany the checkpoints were no longer needed. The big concrete buildings of Checkpoint Bravo are now used by the German Customs Service. Checkpoint Charlie was only a wooden hut in the street. It was moved to what is now the Allied Museum at 110 Clayallee, and a small replica but up in Kochstra√üe., The fake checkpoint is very popular with tourists who have their photographs taken in front of it.
