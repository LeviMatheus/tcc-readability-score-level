A parody is a special piece of art.
Parodies make fun of another piece of art by mocking it. The parody is an imitation of the original, but exaggerating it, showing clich√©s which have been used, to make the original look ridiculous.
For example, in a serious Western movie, the good guys always seem to shoot better and faster than the bad guys. In a Western parody, this might be exaggerated by showing a good guy firing a single shot, and a dozen of the bad guys falling from their horses as a result.
The website Uncyclopedia is also a parody of Wikipedia.
Parodies can be anything from songs to poems to books to movies.
