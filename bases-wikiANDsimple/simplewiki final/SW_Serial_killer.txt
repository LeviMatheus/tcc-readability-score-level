Serial killers are people who murder several people at different times (similar killers of more than one person are mass murderers and spree killers). Their victims are usually people the serial killer does not know, and the motive is usually for how killing people makes them feel, not robbery or revenge, or any of the other reasons most murders happen.
"Serial killer" first became a commonly used phrase for this kind of killers in the 1970s. This was the result of the crimes of people like Ted Bundy and David Berkowitz ("Son of Sam"). Jack the Ripper is thought by many to be one of the first serial killers that many people knew about, even though his victims were killed long before the phrase was invented.
Some of the worst serial killers have been doctors. Harold Shipman, a British general practitioner, is thought to have killed up to 250 of his patients. John Bodkin Adams, also British, is thought to have killed 163 patients.
