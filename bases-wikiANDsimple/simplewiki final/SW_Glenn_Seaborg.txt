Glenn Seaborg (April 19, 1912 - Feb. 25, 1999) was an American physicist. He was born in Ishpening, Michigan.
In 1980, he changed several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using nuclear physics, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atom. Seaborg's techique would have cost too much money to make of gold, but his work is the closest to the mythical Philosopher's Stone.
Seaborg worked at the Manhattan Project. He served in the Atomic Energy Commission and was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.
