Johann Strauss I (born Vienna, March 14 1804; died Vienna, September 25 1849) was as Austrian composer, conductor and violinist. He and his family were famous composers of dance music, especially waltzes. He is usually known as Johann Strauss I or Johann Strauss Sr (Senior), while his son, who was also called Johann, is usually known as Johann Strauss II or Johann Strauss Jnr (Junior). The waltz was just becoming popular in the early 19th century and Johann Strauss I wrote many delightful waltzes and other dance music for the court balls. His most famous tune is the "Radetzky-March" which became a musical symbol of the power of the Habsburg monarchy.
