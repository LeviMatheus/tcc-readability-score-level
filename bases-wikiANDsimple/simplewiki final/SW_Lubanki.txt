Lubanki, Also known as Labanki is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by the Lubanas tribal grouping in the Republic of India and Pakistan. It is classified as a form or dialect of Punjabi. Lubanki has been spoken in Rajasthan and Gujarat areas and some areas of Pakistan. The Punjabi word tanda is allegedly of Lubanki origin and means a town. The dialect is almost extinct. With the loss of language prestige and status, most Lubanas now speak other forms of Panjabi as their primary language.
When Guru Tegh Bahadur Was discovered by Baba Makhan Shah Labana, Makhan Shah climbed on top a village roof and started shouting the famous line Guru ladho rae "The Guru has been found" which is alleged to be in Lubanki dialect.
