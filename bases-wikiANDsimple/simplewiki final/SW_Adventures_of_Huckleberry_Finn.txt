"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" is a book written by Mark Twain, published in 1884. It is a sequel to his earlier book, "Tom Sawyer".
Story.
It is the story of the boy Huckleberry Finn, who already appeared in "Tom Sawyer". Huck, formerly a vagabond, now lives with the Widow Douglas, who tries to teach him to be civilized and acceptable to society. Then one day Huck's father comes back, who is an alcoholic and treats Huck very badly, so Huck runs away. He meets Jim, a black slave who wants to escape to freedom, and they travel down the Mississippi River on a raft. The book tells of their adventures together.
Book History.
The book is often criticised because it shows people doing bad and amoral things, slavery, and bad and vulgar language, for example the word "nigger". On the other hand it is said that the book just shows how life and society were at that time, and that at that time slavery was thought to be normal and right.
