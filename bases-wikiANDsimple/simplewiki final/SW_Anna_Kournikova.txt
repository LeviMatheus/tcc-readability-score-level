Personal life.
Kournikova was born in Moscow in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR - now called Russia) in 1981. Her mother is called Alla and her father is called Sergei. She first picked up a tennis racket when she was five years old and joined the Spartak Tennis Club. She improved very much and when she was 10 years old she moved to Florida to train at an academy.
In 2000, it was reported that she was going to marry Russian NHL player Pavel Bure. Another Russian ice hockey player, Sergei Fedorov, who played for the Detroit Red Wings said that he had married Kournikova in 2001, but they divorced later that year. In 2002, she was in a music video with Enrique Iglesias for his song "Escape". She was Iglesias's girlfriend after this video, but said later that she did not want to get married. Iglesias said she kept saying no when he would ask marry him. He said "I always try, but she doesn't want to." Kournikova has said that she is not interested in getting married: "I'm never getting married. Everything is good."
In 2002 she was the second most popular athlete searched for on Google, and was voted the "Sexiest Woman In The World" by FHM readers. However, some experts working for ESPN voted her the 18th biggest sports failure from 1979 to 2004.
It is thought Kournikova has been paid about £50 million in her career as of 2007, but most of this did not come from tennis. She said "You cannot just be a great tennis player or just be a beautiful person to succeed in the game any more. You have to have it all: the talent, the looks, the brains and the drive."
Playing style.
Kournikova holds her racket in her right hand but uses both hands when she play backhand shots. She is a good player at the net. She has several different types of shots, some of which are her hard shots from the back of the court and drop shots which land just over the net.

In 2001, Kournikova suffered an injury to her foot which meant she was unable to play in many tournaments that year. She got better and won the doubles tournament at the Australian Open in 2002, again with Hingis.

Modeling and sponsorship.
Kournikova began to be a model while she was still playing tennis. When she lost in the first round at Wimbledon in 2002, she had an interview with a reporter from the BBC. The reporter suggested that her modeling was making her concentrate less on tennis. This upset her and she nearly walked out of the interview. She said she was "100% committed to tennis".
Kournikova endorsed a video game called "Anna Kournikova's Smash Court Tennis" for the Sony PlayStation in 1999. She was also sponsored by sportswear manufacturer Adidas and sports bra manufacturer Berlei. She made more than ten times as much money from her sponsors than from playing tennis that year.. She made a £7 million agreement to be in an advertising campaign for internet company Lycos. In 2002, Adidas said they were worried she was was not concentrating on tennis enough.
As of July 2008, she is sponsored by sportswear manufacturer K-Swiss.
