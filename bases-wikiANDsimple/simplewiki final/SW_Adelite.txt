Adelite is a mineral that can be blueish-gray, green, gray, yellow, or light green in color and is made of crystals. It was named from the Greek word for indistinct because of how big it is. The person who discovered it has yet to come forward, so it is unknown for who it was named after. It can be found in Flipistad, Sweden and it is scratched easily with apatite. Adelite is not radioactive.
