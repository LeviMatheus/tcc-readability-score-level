The National Bank of Romania (, BNR) is the central bank of Romania and started in April 1880. It is found in the capital city, Bucharest. The bank's first governor was Eugeniu Carada; the present governor is Mugur IsÄƒrescu.
Scandal.
In 1916, the Central Powers invaded Romania and all valuable objects of the National Bank of Romania and the Romanian Treasure were sent to Moscow for safekeeping. They were never returned.
Robbery.
On July 28, 1959, an armed group of six members of the Romanian Communist Party stole from an armored car of the National Bank of Romania 1,600,000 lei (about US$250,000 at 1959 prices). It was probably the most scandalous bank robbery in the Eastern bloc.
