The Twelve-wired Bird of Paradise ("Seleucidis melanoleucus") is a medium-sized bird of paradise about 33cm-long with velvet black and yellow color. The male has a red iris, long black bill and rich yellow plumes along its flanks. From the rear of these plumes emerge twelve blackish, wire-like filaments, which bend back near their bases to sweep forward over the birds hindquarters. The female is a brown bird with black-barred buffy underparts. Its feet are strong, large-clawed and pink in color.
It is the only monotypic genus "Seleucidis". The male displays on an exposed vertical perch with its breast-shield flared. They eat fruits and arthropods.
It can be found in lowland forests, New Guinea and Salawati Island of Irian Jaya.
