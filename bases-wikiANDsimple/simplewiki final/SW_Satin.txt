Satin is a type of cloth that has a glossy surface and a dull back.
Satin is commonly used in baseball jackets, athletic shorts, women's lingerie, nightgowns, and evening gowns. It is also used in some men's boxer shorts, shirts and neckties, bed sheets, and in the making of pointe shoes for use in ballet.
