288 Glauke is an asteroid found by Robert Luther in 1890. It was the last asteroid he found. It is named after Glauke, a daughter of Creon in Greek mythology.
Glauke has a very slow rotation period of about 1200 hours (50 days). This makes it the slowest-rotating object that is not a planet known in the solar system (both Mercury and Venus rotate more slowly). The rotation is believed to be "tumbling", similar to 4179 Toutatis.
