An invest in meteorology (weather) (also INVEST) is a labelled area of bad weather that is being looked at for a possible tropical cyclone being made. Invests are labelled by three hurricane centers: the National Hurricane Center, Central Pacific Hurricane Center and Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The labelling of an area of bad weather as an invest does not always mean that a tropical cyclone will be started. Invests have numbers from 90 to 99, with a L in the Atlantic, E and C in the East and Central Pacific in that order, or W in the West Pacific after the number.
