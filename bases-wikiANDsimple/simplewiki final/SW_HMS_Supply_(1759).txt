HMS Supply was a small ship, an armed tender which sailed with the First Fleet. She was intended to be a support ship for HMS Sirius (1786). The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. The ships left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January 1788. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. Supply was commanded by Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball.
"Supply" was a brig rigged sloop of 170 tons. A sloop in navy terms is a small ship with a single gun deck. A brig rig means the ship had two masts and carried square sails. She had 8 small 3 pounder guns. She carried 50 men. She was the smallest ship in the fleet, and the fastest.
After the setting up of the penal colony at Port Jackson, "HMS Supply" made 10 trips to Norfolk Island. When HMS Sirius was wrecked in 1790, the Supply was the new settlement's only ship. In April 1790 she made a trip to Batavia to get more food. She left for England in November 1791 and reached Plymouth on April 21, 1792. She was sold at auction in July 1792. Renamed the "Thomas and Nancy" she carried coal on the Thames until 1806.
