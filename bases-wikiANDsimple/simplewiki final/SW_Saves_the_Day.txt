Saves the Day are a band who have played many genres of music during their career. They formed together in 1997, and have often changed their lineup, with singer Chris Conley being the only original member.
At first, saves the day was influenced heavily by melodic hardcore band, Lifetime
Singer Chris often suffers from a certain disease, and he made people aware of this with one of his songs.
The album "sound the alarm" is back to the bands original sound that wasn't so present with the two records before it. "Under the boards" released in fall 2007 mixed together many previous records sounds.
Daybreak, the concluding album in the trilogy is going to be released in 2009.
They will actually start recording the darn thing after a string of shows in late October 2008. Lets hope it is worth the wait.
