The A5M Claude was a Japanese fighter aircraft made by Mitsubishi. It first flew inh 1935 and was introduced in 1937. It was the first monoplane (fixed-wing aircraft with one set of wings) that could be on an aircraft carrier. It was similar to the P-26 Peashooter, an American monoplane fighter. It fought in the second Sino-Japanese War. After the Pearl Harbor attacks, it was not able to fight American fighters like the Curtiss P-40 and the F4F Wildcat, so it was replaced by the A6M Zero.
