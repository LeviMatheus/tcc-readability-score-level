Tokyo (東京) is the capital of Japan. Ten percent (10%) of the Japanese people live in Tokyo, and as many as twenty percent (20%) of the population live around it. As of 2007, the population was 12,790,000. Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and industry of Japan and also of Asia.
Tokyo is in a part of Japan called the Kanto plain. It faces Tokyo bay. Two rivers run through Tokyo. One is the Sumida River which runs from the north to the south, and flows into Tokyo bay.
The other is the Tama River which runs from the west to the east. The Tama River is a border between Tokyo and its neighbor city, Kawasaki.
Tokyo means "the Eastern capital" in Japanese. It became the capital of Japan in the middle of 19th century, when its name changed from "Edo" to "Tokyo". Before then, Kyoto was the capital of Japan. The emperor of Japan, Tenno, lived in Kyoto. Edo was the place where the Tokugawa Shoguns lived. The city grew up under the control of the Shoguns. Before then it was a small town on the sea. Edo means "the mouth of a river" in Japanese.
Tokyo was destroyed by fires started by the Great Kanto Earthquake in 1923. It was also badly damaged by bombs during World War II. The most famous bombing was on March 10, 1945 because of the atomic bomb. After Japan lost the war, the city was rebuilt.
Tokyo held the Olympic Games in the summer of 1964.
