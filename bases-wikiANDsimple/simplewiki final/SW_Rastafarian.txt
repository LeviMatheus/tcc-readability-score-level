A Rastafarian (often called a Rasta) is a member of the Rastafari movement. Most Rastafarians live in the Caribbean, most notably Jamaica.
The most famous person of this kind is reggae artist Bob Marley.
Rastafarians say that Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia, is Jah (shortened from Jehovah). They say that Jesus has returned again (in the form of Haile Selassie I, a.k.a. Jah), as he promised in the Bible, and he will deliver them to Zion, their name for paradise or Ethiopia.
Their diet is called I-tal (derived from the word vital) and is something like Jewish kosher but sometimes with no meat at all.
Dreadlocks are a common hairstyle of Rastafarians. For them, dreadlocks are an expression of spirituality: The term "dread" refers to a "fear of the Lord".
Naturality is an important part of the Rastafari way of life. They want to return to Africa and live naturally. They think that smoking marijuana helps them to get in touch with god, Jah, and their way of life is improved when they practice meditation.
