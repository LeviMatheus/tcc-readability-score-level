The city of Tel Aviv-Yafo (;Â ) is a municipality in Israel, often just called Tel Aviv. It is the second largest city, after Israel's capital Jerusalem. On May 2006, Tel Aviv's population was 379,000, not including about 50,000 people that are not registered.
The city calls itself Israel's capital of culture, economy and trade.
Tel Aviv is a part of a larger block of cities called Gush Dan. About 2.5 million people live in Gush Dan.
In 1909 Jewish people started building the Tel Aviv because Jaffa ("Yafo") and other places nearby were expensive to live in.
