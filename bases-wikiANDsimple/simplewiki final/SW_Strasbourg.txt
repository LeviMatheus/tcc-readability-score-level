Its the seventh largest city in France (The first three are Paris, Lyon and Marseille). It is special in that the whole old town has been classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
The city was founded in 12BC by Drusus, the brother of Tiberius. Its celtic name was "Argentorate" (which the Romans called "Argentoratum"). People think this name is linked to the river Ill (that flows into the Rhine near Strasbourg).
At that time, it was situated on the Limes, a fortification the Romans built across Europe (to keep out the Germanic tribes). There was a fortification (named "castella drusi", "drusus fort") at that spot. Soldiers need to live from something, so a local civilian settlement developed there. Later, the Limes was pushed further east.
