Early days and first releases.
Russell Lissack and Kele Okereke first met each other in 1998 in Essex. They bumped into each other again in 1999 at the Reading Festival and then decided to form a band. Bass guitar player Gordon Moakes joined after answering an advert in "NME", and drummer Matt Tong joined after an audition. After going through many names, like Union, Superheroes of BMX, The Angel Range and Diet, the band chose to call the band Bloc Party in September 2003, as a play on "block party". The band has said in interviews that the name was not supposed to be related to the Soviet Bloc or the Canadian political party Bloc Québécois. However, Gordon Moakes said on the group's official Internet forum that the name was made by joining the eastern "Blocs" and the western "parties", in the political sense. Moakes also said that the name was not chosen only for this reason, but because it "looked, sounded, seemed fine so we went with it."
In November 2003, Bloc Party had their song "The Marshals Are Dead" featured on a compilation album called "The New Cross" released by Angular Recording Corporation. They then released their debut single "She's Hearing Voices" on the record label Trash Aesthetics, which was new at the time.
The band got famous for the first time after lead singer Okereke went to a Franz Ferdinand concert in 2003, and gave a CD of "She's Hearing Voices" to lead singer Alex Kapranos as well as Radio One DJ Steve Lamacq. Afterwards, Lamacq played the song on his radio show. He called the track "genius", and he invited them to record a live session for the show. The success of the track led to another single, "Banquet", being released by Moshi Moshi Records, and to the eventual signing with independent label Wichita Recordings in April 2004.
"Silent Alarm".
Bloc Party's debut album, "Silent Alarm", was released in February 2005 and was given a lot of praise. It was voted as the "NME" album of the year for 2005, and reached number three on UK album charts before being certified platinum. The first single from the album, "So Here We Are", made the top 5 on UK charts. Further singles "Banquet" (which got to number 13 in "NMEs "Top 50 singles of 2005"), "Helicopter", and "Pioneers", managed to reach the UK top 20 but did not do as well as "So Here We Are". The animated music video for "Pioneers", made by Shoreditch-based designers Minivegas, was number one in the "NME" video charts for four weeks.
The band got good reviews from critics in the United States, and they toured there a lot over 2006. At the start of 2006 they finished their tour with sold out shows in Los Angeles, Miami and Berkeley. The album went on to sell more than 350,000 copies in North America and over a million worldwide. After the success of the album, the established electronic group The Chemical Brothers soon collaborated with Okereke for "Believe", a track on the Brothers' "Push the Button" album. An album of remixes of tracks from "Silent Alarm" was released at the end of August in the UK. The album was called "Silent Alarm Remixed", and kept the first album's song list.
During July, Bloc Party recorded two new tracks with "Silent Alarm" producer Paul Epworth. The songs were released as an extended play called "Two More Years". The release of this EP came with another release of "Silent Alarm", which had on it both "Two More Years" and old single "Little Thoughts". "Two More Years" was released later at the same time as their October 2005 UK tour. The single also had a remix of "Banquet" done by The Streets, for which a music video was also made.
The band also made the track "The Present" for the ' compilation album. The money raised from this album went to the War Child charity. In 2005, their album track "Like Eating Glass" was used on the soundtrack of low-budget horror film, "Cry Wolf".
