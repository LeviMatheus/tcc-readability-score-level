Sealand is a very small country in the North Sea, but it is not an island. A structure was put in the ocean by the United Kingdom's Navy, and later that became Sealand. It is very small. There is only room for 10 people in it. Even though a man named Michael Bates says Sealand is a country, no other countries agree with him.
Once some people from The Netherlands went to Sealand to take it over. Michael Bates didn't want this to happen, so he used helicopters and fought them to get it back. He won, and put some of those people in jail. Luckily, he let them go. If a boat goes too near Sealand, people from Sealand might fire guns at the boat.
Even though Michael Bates says he is the prince of Sealand, it is very small so he usually is not there. Other people stay there to take care of Sealand. Sealand has its own stamps, national anthem, money, flag, and more things just like a real country.
Sealand is out in the ocean, and when Sealand was created no country owned the ocean. Also, people asked Michael Bates to let his prisoners from The Netherlands go. Bates said that if they thought Sealand was not a country, they would not ask him to do that.

At the beginning of 2007, the Bates put an ad in the newspaper. They would like to sell Sealand for 65 million pounds.
