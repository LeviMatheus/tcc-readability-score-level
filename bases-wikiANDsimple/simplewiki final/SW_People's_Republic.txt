People's Republic (sometimes called Popular Republic) is a name for a communist, usually Marxist-Leninist country. Currently, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is the only Marxist-Leninist state in the world that uses the title "People's Republic". Because of this, "People's Republic" is sometimes used to refer to China.
