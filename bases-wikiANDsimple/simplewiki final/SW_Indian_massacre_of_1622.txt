The Indian massacre of 1622 (also known as the Jamestown Massacre) was an event where around 347 people were killed in the Virginia Colony of North America on Good Friday, March 22, 1622. The number killed, 347, was almost one-third of the English population of Jamestown. They were killed by a number of surprise attacks by the Powhatan Confederacy (a Native American tribe), who were ruled by Chief Opechancanough.
