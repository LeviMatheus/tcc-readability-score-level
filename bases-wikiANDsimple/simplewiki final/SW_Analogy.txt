Analogy in a more simple understanding is a similar structure to a given structure or the use of a similar example or model to explain something.
To be more precise one can say that it is both the cognitive process of transferring information from a particular subject (the analogue or source) to another particular subject (the target), and a linguistic expression corresponding to such a process.
