The Indo-European languages are a large language family.
Linguists, scientists who study language, believe that all Indo-European languages came from a single language called Proto-Indo-European. This language was originally spoken somewhere in Eurasia. Today they are spoken all over the world, often because of colonization.
The Indo-European languages with the most speakers are Hindi, Spanish, English, Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, French, German and Punjabi.
