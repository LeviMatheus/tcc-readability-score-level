The Space Shuttle is a spacecraft used by the United States' NASA organization. Space Shuttles carry astronauts into space. It is unique among spacecraft because it can be used again.
Shape and body.
The shuttle is shaped like a large airplane. This is another unique thing about it. Having wings and a tail allows the Space Shuttle to glide and land on a runway. Most spacecraft use parachutes when landing. This allows the reusable part of the Shuttle to be very large. People have said that the Shuttle is very much like a pickup truck because of its usefulness.
Rockets.
Two disposable Solid Fuel Rocket Boosters (also called SRBs) and a large external fuel tank are used to lift the space shuttle out of Earth's gravity and into space. After the shuttle is in orbit the boosters and tanks are dropped and fall back to earth. The tank is never used again. The boosters are found in the ocean. NASA pulls the SRBs out and uses them again.
History.
The shuttle was invented in 1973. It replaced the Apollo capsules. The first flight was a test of the landing and maneuvering abilities of the shuttle. This flight was done by the Space Shuttle Enterprise. The first shuttle flight in space was on June 12, 1981. It was done by the Space Shuttle Columbia.
On January 28, 1986 the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds into the flight of STS-51L. It caused a year long stall in space flight.
In the 1990s the Shuttle began working on the International Space Station (ISS). This is now the main job of the shuttle.
Also in the 1990s, the Space Shuttle put the Hubble Telescope into space.
On January 16, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia exploded during the re-entry phase of STS-107. It exploded over Texas. It again caused a long delay in shuttle flight. This happened because some of the heat shield broke off the shuttle during lift-off, after being hit by a piece of the external tank.
