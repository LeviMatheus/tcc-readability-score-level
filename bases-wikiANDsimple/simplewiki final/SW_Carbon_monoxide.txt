Carbon monoxide, also known as "coal gas", with the chemical formula CO, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. It is the product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing compounds. It has significant fuel value, burning in air with a characteristic blue flame, producing carbon dioxide. It is very toxic, but it is useful for modern technology as well. It consists of one carbon atom covalently bonded to one oxygen atom. This is a gas at room temperature.
The most important use for carbon monoxide in industry is making iron from iron ore. The carbon monoxide strips the oxygen off the iron ore in high temperature in a large oven called blast furnace, and leaves bare iron instead. The carbon monoxide turns into carbon dioxide itself.
Production.
It can be also produced by blowing hot steam through red-hot crushed coke
Carbon monoxide can be used as heating fuel because it burns easily into carbon dioxide. It can also be used as so-called "synthesis gas" for making man-made gasoline in Fischer-Tropsch process.
