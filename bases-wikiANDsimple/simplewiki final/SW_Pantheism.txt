Pantheism is the belief that God and the universe are equivalent (the same thing.) A Pantheist believes that everything that exists is a part of God, and that God is nothing more than everything that exists.
Pantheism is an important part of many eastern religions such as Hinduism and Taoism.
Some western philosophers such as Baruch Spinoza and scientists like Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking are Pantheists.
Some Christians, Jews and Muslims are Pantheists. However, their majority believes that while God is in everything, there is more to God than just the universe. (This belief is called Panentheism)
