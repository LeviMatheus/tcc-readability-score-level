Lance Armstrong (born Lance Edward Gunderson on September 18 1971 in Plano, Texas, USA) is a American bicycle rider. He won the Tour de France seven times in a row, from 1999 to 2005. He did this several years after having brain surgery and testicular surgery, and a lot of chemotherapy in 1996, to treat testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs.
He used to race for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, but was only team leader during the Tour de France. He has been accused of doping but the only positive test he has given was for a drug he was later given official permission to use.
He retired in 2005 but he recently announced, that he was going to come back to the Tour de France in 2009.
