Wineries are large plantations built along the fertile banks of major rivers like the Rhine.
Location.
The rivers provided plenty of water for the grapes in the winery, allowed easy transportation of goods, carried off wastes and trash, and kept a heavy mist over the river and the fields, which was cool and kept the sun out.
The sun was bad for the grapes, so it was good to keep it out.
Purpose.
Once the grapes ripened and were picked, they were placed in a large vat, where workers would jump in and crush them with their feet. The juice would flow down to a conical opening covered by a filter, which kept out the grapes. The juice flowed along a pipe to a barrel, cask, or firkin, and was allowed to ferment, or age, thus allowing wine to be made.
