The Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869 were baseball's first all-professional team. The team is in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati Base Ball Club started in 1866 and played teams in the National Association of Base Ball Players 1867 to 1870. In 1969, Major League Baseball played those events officially by starting professional baseball.
The Red Stockings established styles in team uniforms and team nicknames that have some currency even in the 21st century. They also have a particular color, red, as the color of Cincinnati (and serve as the use of "Red Sox" in Boston as well).
