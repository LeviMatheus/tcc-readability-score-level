The Galyat region is an area roughly 50-80km north-east of Islamabad, Pakistan, on both sides of the NWFP-Punjab border. The word "Galyat" is the plural of the Urdu word "gali", which means an alley between two mountains on both sides of which there are valleys and it is not the highest point in the range. Many of the towns in the area have the word "gali" as part of their names. These are popular summer-holiday destinations in Pakistan. Murree, one of the most popular hill stations of Pakistan, is the largest town of the Galyat area.
