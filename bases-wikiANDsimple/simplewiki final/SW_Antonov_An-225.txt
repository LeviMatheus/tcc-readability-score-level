The An-225 "Mriya" is the largest airliner in the world. It has 6 engines. It was manufactured by a company called Antonov. Three of them were built to carry the Russian Space Shuttle 'Buran' but since the shuttle was never finished, the planes have been used to carry very large items that cannot be transported another way.
