A volcano is a mountain where lava (very hot, molten rock) comes from a magma chamber under the ground. Most volcanoes have a crater at the top. Materials which pour out from it usually include lava, steam, gaseous compounds of sulphur, ash and broken rock fragments. Lava is called magma before it has come out of the volcano. Volcanoes are also found on planets other than Earth, like the Olympus Mons on Mars.
The word "volcano".
"Volcano" is thought to come from Vulcano, a volcanic island in the Aeolian Islands of Italy. Vulcano's name itself is taken from Vulcan, the name of a god of fire in Roman mythology. The study of volcanoes is called "volcanology", which is sometimes spelled "vulcanology".
How volcanoes are made.
Volcanoes are usually made when two tectonic plates move toward each other. When these two plates meet, one of them (usually the ocean plate) goes under the other one. Afterwards, it melts and forms magma (inside the magma chamber), and the pressure builds up until the magma bursts through the Earth's crust.
