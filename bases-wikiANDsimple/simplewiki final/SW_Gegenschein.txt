The Gegenshein, also called Counterglow, is a very faint light which can be seen in the sky at night. The light can be seen at the point in the sky that is exactly opposite of the Sun. It is very hard to see. The light can only be seen from areas with no other lights (away from cities) and on nights with no moon. This effect is caused by matter spread around that reflect the light from the Sun, and is related to the zodiacal light.
