Toronto is the largest city in Canada. It is the capital of the province of Ontario.
It is found on the north side of Lake Ontario. Many rivers and creeks flow through the city, making deep ravines. There are many beautiful parks near the ravines.
Almost six million people live in and around Toronto. Most big Canadian banks and companies have offices there.
Toronto is popular with tourists. Visitors can see the Toronto Islands, which are mostly one big park, by taking a ferry. One of the world's tallest towers, the CN Tower, lets people see far away, if they take an elevator to its higher decks. Toronto has a lot of neighborhoods that are distinctive (very different from each other). A lot of "Torontonians" (people who live in Toronto) and visitors think the distinctive neighborhoods make Toronto interesting.
In Toronto, there are many interesting museums for art, history and science. These include the Royal Ontario Museum and the Art Gallery of Ontario. There are interesting buildings like the unique City Hall or the SkyDome stadium (now called the Rogers Centre) which has a roof that opens. The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts which was opened in June 2006 is home to the Canadian Opera Company and the National Ballet of Canada. Visitors to Toronto can also see how the province is run by visiting the legislature in Queen's Park.
Toronto has five major sports teams: the Toronto Maple Leafs (hockey), the Toronto Blue Jays (baseball), the Toronto Raptors (basketball), the Toronto Argonauts (Canadian football) and Toronto F.C. (soccer).
People have come from around the world to live in Toronto. In fact, more than half the people who live in the city were not born in Canada. This makes it an interesting place to see how different types of people live, to hear their languages, and to try different kinds of food. This is why people say Toronto is multicultural.
