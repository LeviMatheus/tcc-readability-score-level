A compilation album is an album of songs, made by different recording artists, or by one group or artist at different times. Some compilations are "greatest hits" albums, that feature the biggest hit records of a given year, or a certain genre of music, or artists from the same era or location. Others are called "best-ofs" or "anthology" albums, and have the same kind of themes. Some compilations include only the biggest record chart hits, while others may include B-sides, hard-to-find songs, or songs that were unreleased earlier.
