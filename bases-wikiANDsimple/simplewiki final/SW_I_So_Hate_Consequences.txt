I So Hate Consequences is a single released by Relient K from their album Mmhmm it was only played on Christian radio it appeared on their official website for a long time.
The song is very Spiritual and openly menions God and redemption through the song.
When played at Concert usually, the band shortens the song, finishing with the guitar bridge, rather than the piano at the end and final guitar.
