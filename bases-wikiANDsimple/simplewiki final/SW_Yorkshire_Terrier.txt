The Yorkshire Terrier or Yorkie is a small breed of dog. It originated in the United Kingdom in the town of Yorkshire, which it is named after. They were originally bred to catch mice, so they are often fast and energetic. Yorkies usually weigh about 7 pounds (3.18 kg) and have a dark gray or black coat with a brown face. According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), Yorkies are the second most popular dog breed in America, behind only the Labrador Retriever.
