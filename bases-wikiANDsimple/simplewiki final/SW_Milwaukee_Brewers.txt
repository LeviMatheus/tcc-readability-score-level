The Milwaukee Brewers are a Major League Baseball team in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They play in the Central Division of the National League.
The team first played in Seattle, Washington for one season before changing names and moving to Milwaukee. The Brewers played in the American League from 1969 to 1997 and they won the American League championship in 1982. They started playing in the National League in 1998.
The name of the stadium where they play baseball is Miller Park, which was built in 2001. (Before Miller Park was built, the team played in Milwaukee County Stadium.) The team is named "Brewers" because Milwaukee, the city where the team plays, is famous for making beer.
