The River Mersey is a river in north west England. It is 70 miles (112 km) long, it stretches from Stockport, Greater Manchester, and ends at Liverpool Bay, Merseyside. For centuries, it formed part of the ancient county divide between Lancashire and Cheshire.
Course.
The Mersey is formed from three tributaries: the River Etherow, the River Goyt and the River Tame. The modern accepted start of the Mersey is at the confluence of the Tame and Goyt, in central Stockport, Greater Manchester. However, older definitions, and many older maps, place its start a few miles up the Goyt; for example the 1911 Encyclopaedia Britannica states "It is formed by the junction of the Goyt and the Etherow a short distance below Marple in Cheshire on the first-named stream."
Environment.
Water quality in the River Mersey has been severely affected by industrialisation.
But Salmon are now found in the river. They can be viewed on the Salmon Steps at Woolston between the months of September and November.
In popular culture.
The river is now internationally famous thanks to the music of the 1960s known as Merseybeat and its strong association with Liverpool, which produced songs such as "Ferry Cross the Mersey".
Also, Paul McCartney's 2007 song "That Was Me", from his album "Memory Almost Full" mentions merseybeating with the band.
