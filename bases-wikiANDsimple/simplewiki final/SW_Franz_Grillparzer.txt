Franz Grillparzer (born Vienna, 15 January 1791; died Vienna, January 21, 1872) was an Austrian dramatist and poet. His dramas include 3 plays (a “trilogy”) called "Das Goldene Vliess" ("The Golden Fleece"). Two other famous plays are "Des Meeres und der Liebe Wellen" ("The Waves of the Sea and of Love") and "Der Traum, ein Leben" ("The Dream, a Life"). Although he said he was not interested in prose his short story "Der arme Spielmann" ("The poor minstrel") is probably the best known of his works and one of the best short stories of the 19th century. Grillparzer wrote the funeral speech for Beethoven's funeral in 1827.
