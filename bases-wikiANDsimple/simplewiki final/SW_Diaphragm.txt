The diaphragm is a muscle that is at the bottom of the ribcage of mammals.
What it does.
When breathing in, the diaphragm pulls down so that the size of the lungs increases.
When breathing out, the diaphragm rests and goes up making a dome shape, decreasing the size of the lungs and pushing air out.
