HyperText Markup Language (HTML) makes web pages display properly on the World Wide Web. It is a markup language, which means it has a mix of a normal language that people can read, and a special programming language that tells computers what to do. HTML is sent and received through HTTP.
A web browser is the program that reads the special language in HTML. This language tells the web browser how the web page should look. The web page can include writing, links, pictures, and even sound and video. It can also have writing that is not shown in the web page, which tells people "about" the web pageâ€”for example, the name of the person who made it.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops HTML. The latest version is XHTML 1.1. It uses XML and can include other XML-languages.
Example.
Most tags have an opening tag to tell the browser where to start something, and an ending tag to tell the browser where to end. An example is <p> to start a new paragraph, and </p> to end a paragraph.
Here is an example page in HTML.
HTML is often used with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to build a complete webpage. Some browsers allow you to look at the HTML coding of the site.
Browsers.
Some HTML effects put in to webpages can only be viewed in certain browsers, because other browsers do not support/recognize the HTML. For example codice_1, used to make text slide across the page, can only be used in Internet Explorer and Mozilla Firefox browsers.
For another example, Netscape users are the only ones who can see blinking codes: codice_2 into effect. Users with other browsers will see only plain text. This is because browsers have made their own tags.
