Hentai is a Japanese word that literally means "strange appearance", but is also used to mean "perverted". Hentai, because of this, is a word used by countries outside of Japan to show pornographic and sex-related anim√©, manga and video games. The word is not used to mean this in Japan. In Japan, terms such as "ecchi" are used.
The word hentai is sometimes used to apply to cartoon characters that are not anime characters.
Most of the hentai(anime)-films in the late 1990s to the present day are based on Ero-Games, where the only actual goal is to date the girls in the game and have sex with one of them. The games feature various character-types, like a bookworm, a tough girl, a younger girl, and a tomboy. Ero-games can include some very gross (like scat or guro) and sometimes also taboo material (like incest, rape and pedophilia). Some examples of these kind of game-to-hentai-anime conversions are Immoral Sisters, Isaku, Pia Carrot, Five Card, Bible Black, Words Worth, Night Shift Nurses, and Milk Junkies.
