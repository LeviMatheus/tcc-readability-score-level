422 Berolina is a common Main belt asteroid.
It was found by G. Witt on October 8, 1896 in Berlin. It was first of the two asteroids he found. The other was the famous asteroid 433 Eros.
Although it has an orbit similar to the Flora family asteroids, it appears to be an unrelated asteroid because it is not an S-type asteroid (see the).
