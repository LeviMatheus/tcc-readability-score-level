A Rapid transit (or Metro(politan), subway, underground, tube, elevated system) is a railway system. Usually it is located in a city or urban area. Trains run very often, and carry a lot of passengers. Usually it is separated from other traffic by a concept called grade separation. Grade separation is when two streams of traffic cross each other on different levels, so they do not influence each other.
In England it is called "Undergound", in Scotland and North America it is called "Subway", in Germany and Austria "U-Bahn" and in the rest of the world usually "Metro".
