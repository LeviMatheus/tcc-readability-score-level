442 Eichsfeldia is a big Main belt asteroid. It is classified as a C-type asteroid and is probably made of primitive carbonaceous material.
It was found by Max Wolf and A. Schwassmann on February 15, 1899 in Heidelberg.
Although Eichsfeldia has an orbit similar to the Vesta family asteroids, it was found to be an unrelated asteroid because it has a different spectral type.
