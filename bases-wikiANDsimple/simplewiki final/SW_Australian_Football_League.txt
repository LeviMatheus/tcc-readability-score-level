The Australian Football League (AFL) is the Australian national league in the sport of Australian Rules Football. The league is the most popular sports competition in Australia. In 2005 6,283,788 people watched a game in a stadium.
It was known as the Victorian Football League from 1897 to 1989, when it changed its name to the Australian Football League, after Australian rules football became a national sport.
The 16 teams play against each other in 22 rounds between late March and early September. These matches are followed by a series of finals matches which end up in the two best teams playing off for the premiership in the AFL Grand Final, one of the largest domestic club championship events in the world.
