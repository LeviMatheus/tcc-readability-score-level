A Pidgin is a simplified language. Usually pidgins develop because two groups of people who do not have a language in common need to talk to each other. Pidgins usually have low prestige with respect to other languages.
Not all simplified or "broken" forms of language are pidgins. Pidgins have their own norms of usage which must be learned to speak the pidgin well.
