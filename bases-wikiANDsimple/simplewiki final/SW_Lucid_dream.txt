A lucid dream is a dream where the person knows that they are dreaming. The person can then try to control things in the dream because it is not real. In a lucid dream, it is possible to do anything the dreamer wants, such as flying.
Some people have lucid dreams for spiritual reasons, but they can also be used for fun.
Ways to lucid dream.
Although some people can have lucid dreams without trying, most people do not have them often. It is important to be able to remember dreams, because if the dreamer doesn't remember them, he or she won't know if they were lucid dreams or not. Remembering dreams becomes easier if they are written in a dream diary upon waking up.
There are some ways that help make lucid dreams more likely. Stephen LaBerge, a psychologist who studies lucid dreams, made the MILD (mnemonic induction of lucid dreaming) technique. To do this, the dreamer must wake up after having a dream, and visualise himself or herself being in the dream again, except now knowing it is a dream. The dreamer should think "the next time I'm dreaming, I want to remember I'm dreaming", and should concentrate on this while returning to sleep.
There are many other ways to help someone lucid dream.
