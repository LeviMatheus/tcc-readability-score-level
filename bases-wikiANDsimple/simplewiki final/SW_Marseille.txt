Marseille is a city in the south of France. About 1.5 million people live the urban area, about 1.3 million in the city itself. This makes it the second largest city in France, but only the third largest when it comes to urban area. The second largest is Lyon. Marseille is located all in the south, at the Mediterranean. It has the biggest commercial port in France. The port is also among the most important ones in the Mediterranean.
Although part of the region of Provence, Marseilles has a soul of its own. Founded in 600 b.c. by the Greek sailors of Phocaea, this great city is the oldest in France and surely the most complex.
The city was started around 600 BC by Greek sailors from (modern day) Fo√ßa. This was a Greek colony in Asia Minor. It is located in modern-day Turkey.
