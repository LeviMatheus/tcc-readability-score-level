Isle of Arran is an island in Scotland. Most people there live in Lamlash and Brodick.
The two towns are rivals. The west has much sheep, and the north, much deer. Two boats go between Arran to the mainland - one goes from Claonaig on the mainland to Lochranze in the north of the island; and the other goes from Ardrossan to Brodick in the east of the island.
