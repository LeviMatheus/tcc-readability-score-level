Old World is a term about the world before Christopher Columbus.
About 1492-1506.
Spain sent Columbus to go to the New World. They found what we call now Indians, and then they became friends and traded.
They had foods and animals Indians haven't seen before, like sugarcane, pigs, horses, and more. But, they didn't know that they were also giving sickness. They accidentally killed many Indians.
After that Time.
The Old World called North America as well as South America the New World.
