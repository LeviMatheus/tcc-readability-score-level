Steinfurt is a "Kreis" (district) in the northern part of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
The ares became a part of the Prussian province of Westphalia in 1815. The new government in 1816 created the districts Steinfurt and Tecklenburg.
In 1975 the two old districts were joined together and Greven and Saerbeck from the former district MÃ¼nster added to make the current district.
