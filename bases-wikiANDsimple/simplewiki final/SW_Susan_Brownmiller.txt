Susan Brownmiller (born February 15, 1935) is a radical feminist. She works as a journalist and activist. She is best known for her pioneering work on the politics of rape in "Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape" (1975). Brownmiller says that rape has been defined by men rather than women until now. Men use rape as a means of continuing male dominance by keeping all women in a state of fear. All men benefit from this. Brownmiller also participated in civil rights activism. She joined CORE during the sit-in movement and volunteered for Freedom Summer in 1964. She first became involved in the Women's Liberation Movement in New York City in 1968. There she joined a consciousness-raising group in the newly-formed New York Radical Women organization. Brownmiller went on to co-ordinate a in 1970, began work on "Against Our Will" after a New York Radical Feminists speak-out on rape in 1971, and co-founded Women Against Pornography in 1979. She continues to write and speak on feminist issues, including a recent memoir and history of Second Wave radical feminism, (1999).
As of 2005, she is an Adjunct Professor of Women's & Gender Studies at Pace University in New York City,
