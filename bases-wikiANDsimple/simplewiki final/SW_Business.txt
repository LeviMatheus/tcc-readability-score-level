A business is a method of organizing work, where one or more people offer to sell goods or services to other people, for more money than it costs them to make or give it.
The difference covers money for possible risks and for the company's profit. The profit is divided into two parts.
The number of people who work for a business can be as low as one, such as a barber shop in a small community, or as many as hundreds of thousands of people all over the world, such as a company that makes automobiles.
Some businesses do not need a fixed location, such as an office or a store. A carpenter or electrician who works for himself usually brings everything they need for work in their truck, and fishermen who stay out at sea work out of their boats.
"Business" can also mean the work or current state of the business, as in "doing business" or "business is good".
