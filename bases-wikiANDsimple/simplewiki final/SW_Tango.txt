Tango is a dance that was created in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The musical style that was created with the dance is also called "tango".
The first tango dances and music was called "tango criollo," or simply "tango". Today, there are many tango dance styles, including Argentine Tango, Uruguayan Tango, Ballroom tango (American and International styles), Finnish tango, Chinese tango, and vintage tangos. The Argentine tango is normally seen as the "authentic" tango since it is closest to that originally danced in Argentina and Uruguay, though other types of tango have also become important and famous dances.
