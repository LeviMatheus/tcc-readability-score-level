The Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) is an organization that rates video games. Rating is voluntary. Game publishers do not have to submit their games for ratings. There are five ratings: EC (Early Childhood), E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature), AO (Adult Only), and RP (Rating Pending). Some retailers make people show identification to prove their age if they want to buy M-rated games. Many retailers will not buy and sell AO games so it is very hard for gamers to find AO-rated games.
On the back of each game's box, the ESRB also rates elements of the game. The back of "Super Princess Peach" has the words "comic mischief" on it to tell parents that it contains comic mischief.
