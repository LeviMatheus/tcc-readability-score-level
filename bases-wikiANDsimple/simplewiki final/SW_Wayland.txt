Wayland was the Germanic god of blacksmiths. In Anglo-Saxon writing, he appears in "Deor", "Waldere" and in "Beowulf" and the legend is shown on the Franks Casket.
Wayland is connected with Wayland's Smithy, a burial mound in Oxfordshire. This was named by the Saxons, but it was there before them. The place has a superstition that says that if a horse is left there overnight with a small silver coin ("groat"), it would have new shoes by morning.
