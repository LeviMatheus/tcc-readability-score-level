The International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (also known as ICD) is a list of codes to classify diseases, including signs, symptoms, abnormal findings, social circumstances, complaints and external causes of injury or disease.
ICD is published by World Health Organization, and it is made to promote international comparability. Current edition is ICD-10, and next one, ICD-11, is planned for 2015, which will be revised using Web 2.0.
