Trickery is the act of misdirection (leading into the wrong way of thinking) or an illusion (seeing things that are not true).
For example, magic tricks are when someone makes the person seeing it think that the magic they are doing is true, but it actually isn't. But magic tricks can also be good, since children can enjoy the magic more.
A trick can also mean to lie or misdirect (lead to wrong way of thinking) a person so that someone who is "tricking" the person can enjoy winning the game they are playing for example gambling.
