Hub River (Urdu: دریائے حب) is located in Lasbela, Balochistan, Pakistan.
It forms the provincial boundary between Sindh and Balochistan, west of Karachi.
Hub Dam is a large water storage reservoir constructed in 1981 on the Hub River in the arid plains north of Karachi. The reservoir supplies water for irrigation in the Lasbella district of Balochistan and drinking water for the city of Karachi. The dam is an important staging and wintering area for an appreciable number of waterbirds and contains a variety of fish species which increase in abundance during periods of high water.
The Mahseer ("Tor putitora"), an indigenous riverine fish found in the Hub River, grows up to 2m in length and is fished.
The Hub dam was declared a wetland of importance in 2001.
