In typography, a font or fount is usually defined as a set of all the characters of a single size of a typeface. For example, all characters for 9 point Bulmer is a font, and the 10 point size would be another font.
With the increase in the use of personal computers, definition has changed. The term font is now often used as another name for a typeface. The size of the characters has no effect on fonts when using this definition.
