SketchUp is a 3D modelling program made for architects, engineers, and filmmakers. It is easier to use than most programs used for three dimensional drawings. SketchUp was created by the company @Last Software and released in August 2000. In 2006, @Last Software was bought by Google. They released SketchUp6 in January 2007. SketchUp6 can use add-ons that let things build with the program be made into files that can be used with Google Earth.
