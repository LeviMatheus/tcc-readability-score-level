The Chinese Civil War was fought from 1927 to 1949. On one side were the Communists, who wanted to make China like the Soviet Union. They were backed by the Soviet Union, and they had the support of many poor people. On the others side were the Nationalists, who wanted to make China like the United States. They were also called the Guomindang. They were backed by the United States and the United Kingdom, and they had the support of the richer people and the Chinese who lived in cities. More than a million people died in the Chinese Civil War. The Communists were lead by Mao Zedong, and the Nationalists were lead by Chiang Kai-shek.
Sometimes the two groups stopped fighting and helped each other. One time this happened was when Japan invaded China during World War II. But soon they started fighting again. Eventually, in 1949, the Communists chased the Nationalists out of the biggest part of China, the mainland. The Nationalists came to an island called Taiwan, and stayed there. Mao named China the People's Republic of China and he became its leader until he died in 1976. Today, the two sides still do not like each other, but they aren't fighting any more.
