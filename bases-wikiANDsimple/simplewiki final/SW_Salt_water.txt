Salt water (or salt-water or saltwater) most often means the water from the seas and oceans. This type of water is also called sea water. Saltwater is the opposite of fresh water.
Salt water contains salt. People cannot drink salt water because the salt in the water will make them dehydrated - their bodies will lose more water than they drink, and they may become sick. However, many different types of fish, animals, and plants live in salt water. "Sea salt" is made by drying salt water.
Salt water used for making or preserving food is usually called brine.
When scientists measure salt in water, they usually say they are testing the salinity of the water.
