Dsungaripterus ("Wing of Junggar Basin") was a pterosaur with 10 feet (3 m) wide leathery wings. It had an unusual bony crest running along its snout and had long, narrow, curved jaws with a pointed tip. The crest may have acted as a rudder when flying or may have been a sexual characteristic. It had flat teeth at the back of the jaws, probably for crushing the shells of its prey. It was not a dinosaur, but a type of extinct, flying reptile.
Dsungaripterus wings were covered by a leathery membrane. This thin but tough membrane stretched between its body, the top of its legs and its elongated fourth fingers, forming the structure of the wing. Claws protruded from the other fingers.
