The 2005–06 NHL season was the 88th season of the National Hockey League. This was the season after the 2004–05 season which was cancelled due to a labour dispute with the NHL Players Association over the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between the league and its players. The 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs began on April 21 2006, and ended on June 19, with the Carolina Hurricanes defeating the Edmonton Oilers to win their first Stanley Cup.
