Torture is when some people put a person in pain. This pain may be physical or psychological. The person who is tortured, is usually tortured because he or she has some information the other people want.
Torture has in the past also served as a punishment. At 1600 Anton Praetorius fought against torture and against the chase of witches.
People who have been tortured are often suffering in the long term. They may have been mutilated, and a severe trauma may be present in them.
Almost all countries agree that "torture" is a violation of human rights. This has been stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. To agree what actually is torture, and what is not, is more difficult.
