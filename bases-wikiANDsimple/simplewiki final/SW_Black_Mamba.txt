The Black Mamba is an elapid type of snake. It is the second largest venomous snake in the world. An adult Black Mamba can be up to 14 foot long. The Black Mamba's skin is not actually black, it gets its name from the colour of the roof of its mouth.
Bite.
A Black Mamba's bite is easily enough to kill an adult man. The deadly poison takes only four hours to kill in most cases. Unlike most snakes it has enough venom to bite many times in a short period.A Black Mamba usually attacks the head of its prey if possible. For this reason a Black Mamba can raise itself to a height of almost four feet.
