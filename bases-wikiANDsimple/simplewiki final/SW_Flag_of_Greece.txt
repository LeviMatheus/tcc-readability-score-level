The flag of Greece is rectangular with nine equal stripes of blue (5) and white (4) from left to right. In the top left corner is a blue square with a white cross. This flag has been used since 1822, when the young Greek state was fighting for its independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Greek War of Independence.
It is sometimes known in Greece as the "blue-white", in Greek "Γαλανόλευκη" (Galanólefki) or "Κυανόλευκη" (Kyanólefki).
