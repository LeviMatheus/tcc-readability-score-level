The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It lies in the front part of the brain.
The cerebrum is divided into two "cerebral hemispheres". These two cerebral hemispheres are connected by nerve fibres.
The outer layers of the cerebrum are made up of the grey matter. The inner layers are made up of the white matter.
There are three main areas in the cerebrum: The sensory area, the association area and the motor area.
All the lobes of the brain are found in the cerebrum.
The cerebrum has about 10,000 billion neurons
