The fictional characters, the X-Men, are a team of superheroes who were born with special mutant powers, making them different from regular humans. The X-Men characters are owned by Marvel Comics, which publishes comic books featuring them as well as many other superheroes. The comic book was one of the first to combine social issues and commentary into a superhero story, set in a world where people with mutant abilites are hated by those born without them. This is similar to acts of racism seen throughout history. Unlike some mutants, the X-Men try to be good and show tolerance toward humans and other mutants.
