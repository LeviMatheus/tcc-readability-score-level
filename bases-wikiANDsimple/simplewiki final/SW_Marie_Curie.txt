Marie Skłodowska–Curie (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a physicist and chemist from Polish but lived in France. She was a expert in the field of radioactivity and the only person to get the Nobel Prize in two different sciences. She was the first woman professor at the University of Paris.
She was born under the name Maria Skłodowska in Warsaw, Poland, and lived there until she was 24. In 1891 she followed her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she received her higher degrees and did her inportant scientific work. She founded the Curie Institutes in Paris and Warsaw. Her husband Pierre Curie also won a Nobel Prize, so did her daughter Irène Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frédéric Joliot-Curie.
Her achievements include the creation of a theory of "radioactivity" (a term comfirmed by her and Pierre), techniques for separate radioactive isotopes, and she discovered two new elements, radium and polonium. It was also under her own direction that the world's first studies were used into the treatment of cancers, using the radioactive isotopes.
While being a French citizen, she never lost her Polish identity. She named the first new chemical element that she discovered (1898) "polonium" after her home country, Poland, and in 1932 she founded a Radium Institute in her home town Warsaw, run by her physician-sister Bronisława.
