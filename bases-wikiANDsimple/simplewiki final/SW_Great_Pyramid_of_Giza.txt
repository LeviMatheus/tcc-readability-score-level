History.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is believed to have been built as a tomb for the fourth dynasty Egyptian pharaoh, "Khufu" and was constructed for over a 14 to 20 year period around 2560 BC, by men that were used as slaves. These slaves worked all day, and only got a "Resting Day" once in ten days, when the sun was the hottest.
