A hydrofoil is a type of boat that can lift it's hull out of the water with a pair of special wings underwater. These wings are like the wings of an airplane.
How it works.
When a hydrofoil moves quickly, it's wings allow it to fly. When this happens the boat is said to be in "foilborne". The result of flying means less of the boat is touching the water and can make the boat have less drag which allows it to move faster (drag slows a boat down).
