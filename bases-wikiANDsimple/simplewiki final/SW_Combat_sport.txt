A combat sport (also known as a combative sport) is a competitive contact sport where two combatants fight against each other using certain rules of contact, with the aim of simulating parts of real hand to hand combat. Boxing, sport wrestling, mixed martial arts and fencing are examples of combat sports.
The techniques used can be categorized into three domains: striking, grappling, and weapon usage. Some rule-sets specialize in one area, while others allow overlap.
