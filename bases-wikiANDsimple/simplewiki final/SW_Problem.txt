A problem is a situation which is difficult to deal with. The word comes from a Greek word meaning an "obstacle" (something that is in your way). If someone has a problem, they have to find a way of "solving" the problem. The way to solve it is called a "solution".
Examples.
"John has locked his car keys inside his car so that he cannot get at them. John has a problem".
Social examples.
We can also talk about a child with "behaviour problems".
Entertainment examples.
Some problems are made up for fun. These are like puzzles. Some of them can be solved with logic, others can be solved by trial and error (this is called "heuristic").
Mathematical examples.
"John is three times as old as Mary. In three years time he will be twice as old as Mary. How old are John and Mary?" (9 and 3)
"Peter, Ruth, Samuel and Jessica live in the same house. Peter and Ruth went out. When they returned they found Jessica lying dead, surrounded by glass. They were sure Samuel had done it. Why did they not call the police?" The answer is: Samuel was the cat and Jessica was a goldfish.
