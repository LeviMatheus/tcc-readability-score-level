"Pokémon" (abbreviated from) is a Japanese anime series. It is part of the "Pokémon" media franchise which is owned by Nintendo. It has been brought to many other places, including North America, Europe, and Australia. The United States dub was made by 4Kids Entertainment, now the dub is made by Pokémon USA.
Not long after "Pokémon Red and Blue" (the first "Pokémon" video games) were released, the anime was created. It was first broadcast in Japan in late 1995, and in the United States in late 1998. The anime started what has been called "Pokémania", which meant that after the anime came out, it became very popular among children, and many parents assumed it was a fad and no one would care about it in a couple years. However, it was never cancelled, and it is still running, although it is not as popular as in 1998 and 1999.
The anime shows the adventures of Ash Ketchum, a 10-year-old Pokémon trainer who has many adventures, meeting many new people and Pokémon. His most famous Pokémon, and probably "the" most famous Pokémon, was Pikachu.
A number of "Pokémon" films have also been made that relate to the anime. The first one was ' (released in 1999). They are still being made.
