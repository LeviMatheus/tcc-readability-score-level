Churros'", sometimes called Spanish doughnuts, are fried-dough pastry-based snacks, sometimes made from potato dough, that originated in Spain. They are popular in Latin America, France, Portugal, the United States, and Spanish-speaking Caribbean islands. There are two types of churros in Spain. One is long and fat, and the other, extra popular in Madrid, is thin and has knots ("porra"). They are both eaten for breakfast and with chocolate.
