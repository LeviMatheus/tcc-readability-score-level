We use time to measure the past, the present and the future.
To measure time, we can use anything that repeats itself regularly. An example is the number of times the Earth rotates (spins around). This is measured in "days". The number of orbits it makes around the Sun is measured in "years". The study of time measurement is horology.
The SI (Systeme Internationale) unit of time is one second, written as s.
