Captain Beefheart AKA Don Van Vliet born Don Glen Vliet (1941-) was an American singer. He was best known for his collaborations and (sometimes) rivalry, with long time friend, Frank Zappa. He is quite underrated, but remains an inspiration to many "alternative" singers. He is retired from music due to illness and spends his time painting, these days. He was born in Glendale, California. His stage name came from a film project Zappa was writing, but soon abandoned, "Captain Beefheart battles the Grunt People". His acknowledged masterpiece was recorded in 1969, its title: Trout Mask Replica.
He and his group "Magic Band" also produced albums in the early 1980's that received positive critical attention.
Mr. Van Vliet is also a well known painter of abstract primitive art. His work has been shown in gallery presentations in New york U.S. and in Europe.
