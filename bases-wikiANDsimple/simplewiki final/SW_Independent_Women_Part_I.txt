"Independent Women (Part I)" is an R&B song written by American singer-songwriter Beyonc√© Knowles, Sam Barnes, Jen-Claude Olivier, and Cory Rooney for Destiny's Child's third studio album, "Survivor" (2001), only considered as a bonus track. It was produced by Knowles, Rooney, and Poke & Tone and first appeared on the soundtrack to the film "Charlie's Angels". Released as both the soundtrack's and album's first single in fall 2000, the song held the number one spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for eleven consecutive weeks from November 2000 to February 2001. Although, for the United Kingdom, it was released on the same day, with both Part I and Part II counting as the song release.
The music video was directed by Francis Lawrence. At the end, the women are greeted by the ever-mysterious "Charlie".
