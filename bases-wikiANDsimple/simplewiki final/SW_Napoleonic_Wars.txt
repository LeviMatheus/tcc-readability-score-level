The Napoleonic Wars are wars that people fought during the rule of Napoleon Bonaparte over France. They started after the French Revolution ended and Napoleon Bonaparte became powerful in France in November 1799. War began between the United Kingdom and France in 1803. This happened when the Treaty of Amiens ended in 1802.
These wars changed European armies and artillery. They also changed military systems. They were very big and destructive, mainly because of conscription. The French became powerful very fast, and conquered most of Europe. The French then lost quickly. They invaded Russia, which failed. The Napoleonic Wars ended on 20 November 1815. This was just after the Battle of Waterloo, a big battle that Napoleon lost, and the Second Treaty of Paris in 1815. Napoleon's empire lost the wars. The Bourbon Dynasty ruled France again.
Some people call all the time between April 20 1792 and November 20 1815 "the Great French War".
