Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun in the Solar System. It is a gas giant. It is the third largest planet in the solar system. The planet is made of ice, gases and liquid metal. Its atmosphere contains hydrogen, helium and Methane. The temperature on Uranus is −197 degrees C (79 K). The planet is tilted on its axis so much that it is sideways.
Uranus completes its turn around the Sun in 84 earth years. It completes its turn around itself in 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means there are 42,000 days in 1 uranian year.
The distance between Uranus and Neptune is 1.6 billion km. Uranus was discovered in 1781. Uranus has 11 rings which are hard to see from earth.
This planet can be seen with the naked eye under the perfect conditions. Some evidence suggests that this planet was catalogued as a star (34 Tauri) before its confirmed discovery.
Uranus is named by Greek god Uranus, who was a god of sky.
