Epistemology (from the Greek words "episteme" = science and "logos" = word/speech) is the part of philosophy that studies knowledge. It seeks to answer the questions "What is knowledge?" and "How is knowledge acquired?". Epistemology is considered to be one of the basic areas of study of philosophy.
Philosophers (people who think about philosophy) who are interested in epistemology think about whether it is possible to have knowledge, what kind of knowledge there is, and how people actually come to know about things.
