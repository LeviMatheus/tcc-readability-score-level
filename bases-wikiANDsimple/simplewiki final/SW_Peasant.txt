A peasant is a name for a person that worked for others and never had much money. They usually wore rough cloths and live in small houses.
The word peasant came from the medieval era (15th century). Peasants worked on farms and had to be able to do a number of jobs on the farm. Peasants usually lived in the country region of their country and made up a large amount of the population.
Most peasants could not read or write. They did not usually talk with the higher society unless it was about work.
