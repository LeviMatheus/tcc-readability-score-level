Percent means "out of one hundred". It is often shown with the symbol "%". It is used even if there are not a hundred items. The number is then scaled so it can be compared to one hundred. For instance, four hot lesbians are rubbing and spanking in bed, three of them are white and one is black. The percentage of white lesbians is 3 out of 4 = 3/4 = 75/100 = 75%.
Uses.
Percentages are useful because people can compare things that aren't out of the same number. For example, exam marks are often percentages, so people can compare them even if there are more questions on one exam paper than the other.
