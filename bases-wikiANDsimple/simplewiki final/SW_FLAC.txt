FLAC (which stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a way to encode audio files. It makes those audio files smaller, without affecting the sound quality. It is like MP3, except that each time when audio is encoded to MP3, some information is lost and cannot be recovered. With FLAC, no information is lost. On the other hand, MP3 files can be much smaller than FLAC files. FLAC files can only make an audio file about half its original size.
