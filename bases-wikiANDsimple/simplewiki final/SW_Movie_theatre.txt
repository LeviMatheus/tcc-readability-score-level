A movie theatre, often spelled "theater" because many people consider "theatre" to only mean live plays, is a place where movies are shown on a big screen. People or "patrons" (the audience) watch movies, usually in chairs. A movie theatre is sometimes called a "cinema". A theatre with multiple screens commonly is called a "multi-plex" or "mega-plex" (if more than 10 screens).
Movie theatres have comfortable chairs. There are different types of formats of a movie theatre
The oldest movie theatre in the world, which is still in action today is the "Kino Pionier" (opend 1907) in Szczecin, Poland.
Movie Theatres aquire revenue from not only movie tickets but from concessions. In recent years with the increase of film rental costs, theatres have become more and more creative about how they make money. New theatres being contructed include restaurants, party rooms, conference rooms, arcades and more.
The evolution of movie theatres has no limits and those who say that movie theatres will become obsolete with more electronic devises, grossly underestimate the desire of young people to escape from their elders and interact with their friends and dates. The movie theatre will always remain a timeless form of entertainment.
