A mouse (plural "mice") is a rodent, which is a kind of mammal. These small animals are often used in science experiments, or sometimes kept as pets. Some people think mice are just ugly pests who carry diseases. Other people think mice are just innocent and cute animals. Because mice are rodents, they are related to squirrels, rats, and beavers. The words rat and mouse are sometimes used to mean the same animal, but that is not correct. Mice eat weeds, seeds, berries, and more. They are are eaten by owls, foxes, and cats, amongst others.
