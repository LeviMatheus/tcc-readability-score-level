A soap bubble is a very thin film of soap water. Their shape is a hollow, round ball, or sphere. They have a colorful surface. Soap bubbles do not last very long. Sometimes they break in the air. When they touch something else, they usually break.
When people talk about soap bubbles they think about them being pretty, but short-lived. So, they are a symbol for other things that are pretty, but short-lived or unimportant.
Children enjoy playing with bubbles. Sometimes, adults enjoy seeing art done with soap bubbles.
Soap bubbles solve some mathematical problems. The problems they solve are problems of filling space. Bubbles enclose the largest space with the least surface.
