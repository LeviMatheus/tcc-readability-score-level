The FM Towns Marty was the world's first 32 bit game console (not the Amiga CD32 which was only in Europe and North America). It was one of the first CD based consoles and the first made for gaming rather than high end PC like systems, like the Amiga CDTV and Phillips CDi. It was only released in Japan and was a commercial failure but despite this it was made until 1999 - longer than the average games console.
