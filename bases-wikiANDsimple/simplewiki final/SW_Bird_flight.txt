Flight is a special way of flying done by birds and such. Birds that soar use very little energy for it. Hollow bones that are light allow the birds to fly easily. Birds have a streamlined body shape, so that less air actually pushes onto them when flying. Birds can fly high or they can also stay at a place and still be in the air. This is called hovering.
