Freemasonry is an organization of people who try to help one another in their profession or in their private lives. Freemasonry can be found all over the world in various forms. About 5 million people are freemasons.
Freemasons help one another in times of hardship. They have various rituals which they perform at their meetings. These rituals are kept secret from anyone who is not a freemason. Freemasonry provides social connections for people in various professions.
Freemasonry is only for men. They believe in "brotherly love, relief and truth". The local groups in various countries are known as "lodges". At the head of a group of lodges is a "Grand Lodge". They do work for charities such as running schools for orphaned children. There is a Royal Masonic Hospital which is a home for old members and their families.
The word mason means a man who works with stone. He is also called a "stonemason". Freemasonry grew from the groups (guilds) of stonemasons in the middle ages. These men were building cathedrals and other big buildings. They were called freemasons because they were free, they were not servants who belonged to a rich lord, like many workers were in those days. They often changed jobs and moved about from one town to another. In this way they were different from other craftsmen who often worked in one place and had guilds in one town. The stonemasons tried to keep their skills secret so that only they knew how to do their job. This is probably why secrets are still part of freemasonry.
About 1650 masons' guilds started to let people who were not masons into their guilds. In 1717 the first Grand Lodge of England was formed. It developed into the governing body of Freemasonry in England, now called the United Grand Lodge.
