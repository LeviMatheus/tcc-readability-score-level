Miranda is one of Uranus' moons. It is the smallest, and the one which has the least rotation time. Gerard Kuiper discovered it in 1948 and named it after Miranda Prospero's daughter in William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. Sometimes it is also called Uranus V.
The probe Voyager 2 made some photos in 1986. These are the only images that exist, so far. Geologically it is the most active body in the Uranus system.
