Iron oxides are chemical compounds. There are sixteen known iron oxides. Iron oxides are used in pigments. It is used in both man-made and natural pigments.
Examples.
Venetian red (haematite), Magnetite (Fe304), or a mixture of oxides make black or purple pigments. The umber’s, sienna’s and ochre’s are oxides or hydrated oxides of a yellow to chestnut colour.
Rust.
A reddish-brown compound of iron and oxygen, commonly known as rust, can be found on the surface of iron objects. These oxides are used in ceramic applications, mainly in glazing. Iron oxides, along with oxides of other metals, provide the colours in some glazes after being fired at a high temperature. They are also used as pigments.
