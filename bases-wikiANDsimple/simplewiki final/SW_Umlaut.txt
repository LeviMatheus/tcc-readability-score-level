The umlaut is the name of the two small dots above the letters A, O, and U in German. Without umlauts those three letters said [a], [o], and [u], but when the umlauts are put over them, Ä, Ö, and Ü change to be said like [ɛ], [œ]/[ø] and [y]/[ʏ].
Ü or ü is not a letter used in English, but is used in some other languages.
