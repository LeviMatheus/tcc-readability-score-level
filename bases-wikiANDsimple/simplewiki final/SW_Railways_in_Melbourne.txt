Melbourne has a long history of railway building. The city's first railway opened in 1854, when in 1834 the city itself did not exist. The network then grew as lines were built throughout the suburbs, reaching a peak by the 1900s. Electrification of the system was carried out from 1919, with electric multiple unit operation starting at the same time.
