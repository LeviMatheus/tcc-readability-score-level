The Socratic Method (or Method of Elenchus or Socratic Debate), named after the Greek philosopher Socrates, is a form of philosophical questioning in which the questioner explores the ideas of others' positions, to stimulate rational thinking and illuminate ideas. This dialectical method often involves an oppositional discussion in which the defense of one point of view is pitted against another; one participant may lead another to contradict himself in some way, strengthening the inquirer's own point.
