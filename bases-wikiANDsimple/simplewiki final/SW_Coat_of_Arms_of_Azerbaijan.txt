The Coat of arms of Azerbaijan mixes traditional and modern symbols. The focal point of the emblem is the fire symbol. This symbol comes from the fact that Azerbaijan has many everlasting fires which also gives the name "land of eternal fire".
The colors used in composing the emblem are taken from the national flag. These colors are found in the background behind the eight pointed star (Ûž Rub El Hizb) upon which the flame is shown. The star itself stands for the eight branches[?] of the Turkic peoples, and between each point of the star, there is a smaller eight pointed star found.
Like other post-Soviet republics whose arms do not predate the October Revolution, the current arms retains some components of the Soviet one. At the bottom of the emblem is a stalk of wheat, representing the main agricultural product of the nation, which was also part of the earlier arms. The other plant represented at the bottom is oak.
