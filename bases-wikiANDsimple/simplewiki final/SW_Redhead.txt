Redhead is a person with red or reddish hair.
Red hair is made by genes. This means to have natural red hair person needs to have red haired ancestors. Red hair is made by different genes than blonde (yellow or light coloured) hair, but to have bright red hair person needs to have both red hair and blonde hair making genes.
Red hair is said to be most usual close to the Northern European coasts and islands of Atlantic Ocean, like the British Isles. Blonde hair, however, is more usual at areas more north and more east, around Baltic Sea. While the Finns are the most blonde people, it is said that Irish people are the most red headed.
