INSEE Code.
INSEE codes (or COG) are given to Communes in France. They consist of 8 digits (numbers) but there is a simple version with 5 digits. The first two digits (3 for Overseas France) are the number of the department. The other 2 (or 3) numbers are the number of the commune. The INSEE code is not the same as the postcode.
