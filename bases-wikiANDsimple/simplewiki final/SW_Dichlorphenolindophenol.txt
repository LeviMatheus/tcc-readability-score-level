DCPIP (its full name is "2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol") is a blue chemical used as a dye as when it is in its oxidized state it is blue.
Information.
Once reduced (by addition of electrons) it becomes colourless. This reaction can be reversed, and the colourless DCPIP will turn blue again, when it is oxidized.
Purpose.
DCPIP is often used to measure the electron transport chain in plants. It has a higher redox potential (electron affinity) than the Fe-S complex in cytochrome b and will therefore "steal" electrons from it. This means that cytochrome c does not receive them. The process cuts off the electron supply of photosystem I. A common way to illustrate this change is by the addition of vitamin C solution. This reduces the 'jelly' by transforming it to a colourless mass. This experiment can be carried out to illustrate the affect of changing cell sizes on SA/V (surface area:volume ratio). This is known as Titration.
