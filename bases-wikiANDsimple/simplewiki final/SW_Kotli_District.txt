Kotli (Urdu: کوٹلی) is one of the eight districts of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Kotli is the capital city of the district. Kotli used to be a small town between Mirpur and Muzaffarabad, but has recently grown in size.
Meaning of name.
There are two theories about the origin of the name "Kotli". One is that in ancient times Prince Raja Shahswar Khan built a small house here and called it "Kot", which became "Kotli". Another theory is that the name is derived from the Sanskrit word Kotli which means to reside or to live in. At one time the area was inhabited by the Mangran and Solhan peoples, and was called Kotli Solwhan.
