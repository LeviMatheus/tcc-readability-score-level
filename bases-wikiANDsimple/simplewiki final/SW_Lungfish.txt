Lungfish are special freshwater fish. They are special because they are the only fish that have both gills, as well as lungs. They need this because they live in small lakes and rivers that sometimes dry up. When this happens, these fish don't die, but they can survive in the mud, for up to 4 years. They use their lungs during this time.
Currently there 8 species of lungfish, 6 of them in Africa, one in South America and one in Australia.
