MÃ¼nster is one of the five "Regierungsbezirke" of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, located in the north of the state.
The "Regierungsbezirk" was made in 1815. This means it is oneof the original 25 "Regierungsbezirke" made to help govern Prussia.
The last time the boundaries of the region were changed was 1975. This was when the number of districts was changed from 10 to 5, and the number of district-free cities (urban districts) from six to three.
