It was first sold in stores in North America on May 15, 2006, and was later sold in stores in Japan on May 25, 2006, in Australia on June 8, 2006, and in Europe on June 30, 2006.
Story.
Mario and Princess Peach are out for a walk when Bowser Jr. kidnaps Peach. Mario must go through eight worlds to save her.
Gameplay.
The game uses many old features from older Mario games. The countdown game clock is back; if Mario does not reach the castle at the end, he will lose a life. Mario also must jump and catch onto a flagpole at the end of the level and goes into a castle, just like he did in "Super Mario Bros.". Before and after a level, Mario is on a world map, which was last used in "Super Mario World".
Mario also has new powers from the 3D games ("Super Mario 64" and "Sunshine"). He can stomp things and can do a triple jump in the air. Both of these things first sarted in the 3D games.
