"Carcharodontosaurus" was a giant carnivorous dinosaur of Cretaceous period. It was about 13.5 meters long and had a weight of about six tons. Fossils of "Carcharodontosaurus" were found in North Africa. The name means 'shark tooth lizard'.Carcharodontosaurus was closely related to giganotosaurus as they were both carnosaurs recent discoveries of carcharodontosaurus put estimates of its length in 36-44 feet making it after spinosaurus the largest carnivorous dinosaur in Africa. Carcharodontosaurus may be smaller than spinosaurus and giganotosaurus but it is larger than tyrannosaurus. Only two carcharodontosaurus remains have been found the first remains found in the 1920's were destroyed in bombing raids in world war 2 while they were on display but a new skuul in 1996 was uncovered and its length estimates were larger than the older ones and so was its skull witch measured 5.5 feet 1.10 metre. This devil is able to rip through its victims skin. Its jaws are narrow like that of giganotosaurus. Its huge teeth were nearly 7in. Scientists are looking for more giant carnivores witch might even replace todays giant carnivores including carcharodontosaurus.
