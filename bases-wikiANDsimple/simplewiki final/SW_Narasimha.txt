Narasimha, according to Hinduism, was the fourth avatara of Vishnu. In this form, Vishnu had the body of a man, but he had a head of a lion. This avatara of Vishnu is also a symbol of great strength.
The Hindu scriptures tell this story about narashimha avatara. There was a daitya (a demon) named Hiranyakashipu. He was against all gods. But, his son named Prahlad used to worship the gods, especially Vishnu. Hiranyakashipu was not happy at his son and wanted to burn him to death. Hiranyakashipu also wanted to kill everyone who worshipped the gods and make everyone worship him instead. Vishnu became Narasimha, and protected Prahlad and other people who worshipped the gods by stopping Hiranyakashipu. Brahma granted Hiranyakashipu a boon that keeps him safe so that he cant be killed by a human, animal or deva. He also can't be killed in the day or night, or inside or outside of his palace. This made Hiranyakashipu believe that no one could kill him. When he wanted to kill his son for worshiping Vishnu, Vishnu came to earth reincarnated as a half-man, half-lion creature (neither man nor human), in the twilight (neither day nor night), and on the porch of the palace (neither inside nor outside). This way Vishnu could kill Hiranyakashipu without disrupting the boon given to him by Brahma.
