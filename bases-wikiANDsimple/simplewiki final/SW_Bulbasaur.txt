Bulbasaur is a Grass-type Pokémon, and is strong against Water, Ground, and Rock Pokémon. It is weak against Fire, Flying, and Ice Pokémon though. The player can get Bulbasaur if they play the video games "Pokémon Red", "Pokémon Blue", "Pokémon Fire Red", or "Pokémon Leaf Green" at the very start. If they get Bulbasaur at the start, their rival (main enemy) in the game will get Charmander, a Fire Pokémon.
Bulbasaur has a closed flower on top of it, which opens when it changes into Ivysaur, and then fully flowers when it turns into Venusaur. As Bulbasaur changes, it gets bigger. Bulbasaur gets better as it evolves, making it more powerful against other Pokémon.
Bulbasaur is the first Pokémon in the pokedex.
