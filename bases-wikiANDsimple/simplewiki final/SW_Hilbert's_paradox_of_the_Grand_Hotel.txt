Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel is a mathematical paradox named after a famous German mathematician David Hilbert. It is used to show how infinity does not act in the same way as regular numbers do.
In regular hotel, with a finite number of rooms, even if it is very big, it is obvious that if there is a guest in every room, we can't find a room for another guest without making two guests live in the same room. Then imagine a hotel, called Grand Hotel, with an infinite number of rooms, which is full, so there's a guest in each room. Unlike normal hotels, we still can find a room for a new guest: we move the guest in room number 1 into the room number 2, then the one in the room number 2 into number 3, and we keep moving guests until every guest who was, at start, in room number "n", is moved to room number "n+1", and finally we move the new guest into the room number one. This shows how we can find a room for a new guest even if the hotel is already full, something that could not happen in any hotel with a finite number of rooms.
