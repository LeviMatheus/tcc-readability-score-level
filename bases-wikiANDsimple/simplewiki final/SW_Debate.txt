Debate (American English) or debating (British English) is a formal method of argument.
It is a larger form of argument than logical argument, because in a debate, the debaters try to influence the feelings of the hearers, in order to persuade them on a topic.
Informal debates like discussion are very common, but the quality of a debate improves with knowledge and skill of its participants as debaters.
Deliberative bodies such as parliaments, legislative assemblies, and meetings of all sorts have debates. The winner of a debate may be decided by the audiences vote, by judges, or by both. Formal debates between candidates for a elected office, such as the leaders debates and the U.S. presidential election debates, are common in democracies.
