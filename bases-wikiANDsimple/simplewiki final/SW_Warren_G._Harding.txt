Warren G. Harding (November 2, 1865â€“August 2, 1923) was the 29th President of the United States. He was the president from 1921 to 1923. He died while he was the president. Before becoming president, he was a senator and the assistant governor of Ohio. Before he was in government, he was an important newspaper manager. He was in the Republican Party and believed that government should do as little as possible. Very few people think that his work as president was very good, and in fact he had a lot of problems with it. His vice president Calvin Coolidge became president after he died.
