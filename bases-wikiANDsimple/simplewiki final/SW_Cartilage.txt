Cartilage is the hard substance that the body uses to connect bones together. It also allows joints to move smoothly and protects against shocks to the body. It is found in the joints, the rib cage, the ear, the nose, the throat and between the bones of the back. The main purpose of cartilage is to create a place on which bones can form when they are first created. It also protects the places where bones rub against each other.
Parts.
Cartilage has cells and fibres (tiny strings) that cross over each other like fabric.
