Tynwald is the second oldest government of continuous existence in the world, dating back over 1000 years, following the Papacy.
It is in existence on the Isle of Man, and while the island is Crown Dependent (it depends on a king/queen, in this case. of England), this ancient form of government enjoys a large amount of political power.
Queen Elizabeth II is acknowledged as the Lord of Man.
The Tynwald is a direct legacy from the ancestors of Viking and Norse descent that first colonized the Isle of Man.
