The Partition of British India was done in August of 1947. After partition of the British Empire, it became two countries, namely, Republic of India and Pakistan. The term does not have to do with the earlier separation of Burma and Ceylon from India, nor the Partition of Pakistan in 1971. Mohandas Gandhi opposed the partition, saying,
"My whole soul rebels against the idea that Hinduism and Islam represent two antagonistic cultures and doctrines. To assent to such a doctrine is for me a denial of God."
