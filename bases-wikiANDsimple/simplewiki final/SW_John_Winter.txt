John Winter (September 8, 1967 - April 5, 2007) was a weather man for NBC's news channel WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida.
Winter was a native of Seminole, Florida and a graduate of Seminole High School. He was a Bachelor of Arts graduate in weather at the University of Kansas. He started his job as a television weather man at KGBT-TV in Harlingen, Texas, working there for two years, before he moved near Tampa in 1994. It was here that he joined WFLA-TV. During most of his career in Tampa Bay, he was the morning meteorologist for WFLA-TV, sometimes on the evening reports. Winter held the Seal of Approval from the American Meteorological Society.
In addition to his meteorological career, he was also a co-owner of "Big U Media", an advertising firm that he co-owned with a friend and WFLA-TV colleague. He was also a member of a local charitable organization and Mardi Gras krewe, The Rough Riders, who help underprivileged and sick children by giving teddy bears at homeless shelters and in hospitals.
A major animal lover, Winter featured an animal up for adoption for each hour of the morning show during his weather segments on behalf of local animal shelters. The adoption success rate was outstanding.
Death.
On April 5, 2007, as deputies pounded on his front door responding to an anonymous call to his home in the Tealside section of Lithia, Winter shot himself and died very quickly. His death surprised co-workers and viewers. He had left the station after a newscast the night before cheerful and upbeat in mood. However, it was learned that he suffered from severe depression.
