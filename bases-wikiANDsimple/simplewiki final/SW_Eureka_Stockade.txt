The Eureka Stockade is the name given to a rebellion by gold miners at Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It took place on the December 3, 1854. The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. They built a fort on a hill near the gold diggings. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed.
Flag.
The miners made their own flag which was flown above the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890's. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1970's the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006.
The flag has often been used as a symbol of rebellion. Trade unions used the flag in their marches. The Prime Minister, John Howard, banned the flag from being flown on building sites.
In 2008, the Football Federation of Australia tried to stop the flag from being flown by supporters of the soccer team, Melbourne Victory. They said it was against their rules for teams to use political symbols.
