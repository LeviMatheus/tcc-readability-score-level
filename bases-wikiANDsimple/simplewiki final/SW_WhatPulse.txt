WhatPulse is a key counting program which monitors the number of keystrokes, mouse clicks and can now measure the distance your mouse has traveled.
The program is not a keylogger as it does not record the keys that the user press, just the amount of times keys are pressed.
It can also display the speed the user types by calculating the average of how much they have typed over a period of time.
A Pulse.
A user sends a "Pulse" to the WhatPulse server which contains how much a user has typed and clicked since the last "Pulse".
WhatPulse also allows a user to automatically "Pulse" at a certain amount of keystrokes, mouse clicks, distance or at a certain time since the last "Pulse".
