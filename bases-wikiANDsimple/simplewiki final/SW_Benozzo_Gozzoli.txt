Benozzo Gozzoli (1420-1498) was an Italian Renaissance painter. He is most famous for a small chapel that he decorated with frescos of the "Procession of the Magi".
Life.
Benozzo was born in Florence in about 1420. Nothing is known about his parents, or how he started training as an artist. The first that is known of him is that in 1444 he was working with the famous sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti, who was making the bronze doors for the Baptistry of Florence Cathedral.
In 1447 he started working with the painter Fra Angelico. He went to Rome with Fra Angelico to help paint the Chapel of Pope Nicholas V in the Vatican. In 1449 he was working in his own studio.
Works.
For many years Benozzo worked as an assistant to other artists. At that time, he had to make his style match the style of the master, so it is hard to tell his art works apart. When Benozzo painted on his own, his pictures are rich with many details in the clothing, the buildings and the landscape. He was extremely good at painting faces, and many of the people in his pictures seem to be portraits of real people.
