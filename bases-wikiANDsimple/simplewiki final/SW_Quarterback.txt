A quarterback (QB) is a position in American and Canadian football. Quarterbacks are members of the attacking team. They line up directly behind the center, in the middle of the attacking team's line. A quarterback is usually the leader of the attacking team, and starts most plays. In addition, the quarterback gives commands to the other players before the start of a play. A quarterback will in most attacking plays throw the ball to a member of their team, ready to run to the end of the pitch.
