In biology, natural selection is the process where organisms with favourable traits are more likely to reproduce. In doing so they pass on these traits to the next generation. Over time this process allows organisms to adapt to their environment.
Organisms naturally aren't all alike, because of differences in genetics. This is true even with children of the same parents. Some of these differences might make one organism better at surviving and reproducing than others in a habitat. This organism has an advantage over other organisms. In other words, it has been "selected". When this organism reproduces, it passes along the qualities that gave it the advantage to its children. This advantage is only good as long as the environment stays the same. If the environment changes, another organism might do better.
One example of natural selection is a type of moth. Some of the moths were light and some of the moths were dark. The light coloured moths survived better because they were camouflaged against the white colour of the nearby trees. This made it hard for their enemies to see them. When a factory was built, it caused pollution that made all the trees look black. Now the light coloured moths were obvious against the dark bark. The dark coloured moths now had the advantage, after the environment changed.
