Anguilla is a group of five islands in the Caribbean Sea. The islands are ruled by Great Britain.
Anguilla was once part of what is now Saint Kitts and Nevis, but broke away in 1980. Anguilla wanted to still be a part of Great Britain, and Saint Kitts and Nevis wanted to be independent.
It is named after the Spanish word for "eel", because it has such a shape.
Politics.
The queen of the United Kingdom is the ruler of Anguilla, but she works through a governor. She names, or "appoints" the governor, and he is just working there in her place. The legislature is elected by the people, has 11 members, and is called the House of Assembly.
Economy.
Anguilla gets most of its money from fishing and tourism.
Culture.
Most people in Anguilla are Protestants, and speak English.
