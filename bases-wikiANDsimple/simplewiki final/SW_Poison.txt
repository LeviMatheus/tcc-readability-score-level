Poisons (or "toxins") are things that can make people sick or die. "Toxic" is an adjective to describe something that is poisonous. A poison which is produced by an animal is called venom.
People may die if they eat poisons or come in contact with them. They can be liquid, powder, or gas. They can be made by people and by plants or animal's bodies. Poison bottles usually have a skull and cross-bones sign on them. Sometimes poisons have an antidote that can cure people who eat or drink them.
