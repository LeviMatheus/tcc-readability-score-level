Triple-Zero (often referred to as “Triple-O or O-O-O) is the national hotline in Australia if someone has a emergency that is putting themselves at danger of being killed. This hotline can connect people to the fire station, the ambulance or the police. In areas where there is no mobile phone service, 112 can be dialled, with the person being asked for their location by the call taker.
Any use of Triple-Zero or 112 for any non-emergency calls are against the law.
History.
Before 1961, Australia did not have a national number for emergency services; Each of the different emergency branches (police, fire department, etc.) each had their own number. In 1961, the Postmaster General (PMG) introduced the 000 number in most of the major Australian cities and by the end of the 1980s it had become nation-wide. The number 000 was chosen for several reasons, one of which was that it was easy to dial in darkness because the number zero was next to the light on most Australian telephones.
Possible Uses.
A person might dial Triple-Zero if -
Procedure.
When Triple-Zero is dialled, a person from the national telecom service, Telstra, asks the caller “Emergency, Police, Ambulance or Fire?”. The person will then connect the caller to the required service. The service will ask the person what the problem is, and dispatch the unit.
Ambulance Problems.
In Queensland, people have rung up the triple-zero phone number requesting the ambulance service, for such little issues such as a blood finger. The ambulance will then come to the house, and give first aid for the bleeding. However, in Queensland, if the person wishes to go the hospital to have the issue fixed, the driver is required by law to take them there. Once the person arrives at the hospital, the person actually goes and visit’s a ill relative, or walks to the local shops. The Queensland Ambulance Service has said there would be a law introduced that would make people pay a AUD$400 fine for doing this many times.
