In grammar, grammatical case talks about the role of a noun in a sentence. In many languages like English a noun's case is shown by word order and prepositions (words like "to" and "for"). In other languages like German, Russian and Japanese, a noun's case is shown by the end of the word (the nouns change depending on their role in the sentence) and so the word order is less important in these languages. Nouns change their endings to show if they're doing an action, if they're having an action done to them, if they just happen to be there during the action and whether they own something.
