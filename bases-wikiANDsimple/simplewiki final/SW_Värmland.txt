Värmland is a historical province or "landskap" in the west of middle Sweden. It borders Västergötland, Dalsland, Dalarna, Västmanland and Närke. It is also bounded by Norway in the west. Its Latin name is "Wermelandia"; its English derivative is "Wermland" or similar variation. The origin of the name is uncertain. It may refer to a lake by that name, or to a river.
