Westmorland (an older spelling is "Westmoreland", an even older spelling is "Westmerland") is an area of north west England and one of the 39 historic counties of England. It was an administrative county from 1889 to 1974 and now is part of Cumbria.
Early history.
At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the county was said to form part of Yorkshire.
The historic county borders are with Cumberland to the north, County Durham and Yorkshire to the east, and Lancashire to the south and west.
The highest point of the county is Helvellyn at 950m (3,117 ft). According to the 1831 census its area was 485,990 acres.
Appleby, the historic county town, made a historic borough.
In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the county was abolished and its former area was combined with Cumberland and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire to form the new county of Cumbria. The former county now forms part of the districts of South Lakeland and Eden.
