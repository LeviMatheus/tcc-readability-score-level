The pound is the official money used in the United Kingdom. The pound is divided into 100 pence.
The pound got its name because it was the value of one pound (weight) of "sterling silver". This is why it is called "pound sterling". "Sterling silver" means mixed metal that has 92.5% or more real silver. The sign for the pound is £ which is similar to a capital L because "libra" is the Latin for pound. The symbol for pennies is "p" (pronounced "pee" like the letter). We write 50p or £0.50 and say it "fifty pee".
Today’s coins are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 and £2. The notes are £5, £10. £20. £50.
The old system.
The pound has only been divided into 100 pennies since 1971. Before this time it was divided into 20 shillings. Each shilling was divided into 12 pennies.
The symbols for shilling and penny came from Roman coins: "s" for shilling (from the Latin word "solidus" and "d" for penny (from the Latin "denarius"). The penny was divided into 4 farthings. The farthing became obsolete (was no longer used) in 1961 because it was worth so little.
How prices were written and pronounced in the old system.
There was also a "guinea". Originally the guinea was an old gold coin. Although the coin had been obsolete for a long time, prices were still sometimes given in guineas. A "guinea" was 21s (or £1 1s 0d). A price of 58 guineas was, in fact, £60 18s 0d, which sounds more than "58 guineas".
It was difficult to add up prices using the old system. You had to be very good indeed at maths. That is why Britain changed to the decimal system (units of 10s and 100s) in 1971.
