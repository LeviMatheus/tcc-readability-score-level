Humans.
A person's sex is either male or female. For example: John's sex is male. Mary's sex is female. This difference is sometimes called gender. Not all living things have a sex. There are not male or female germs or yeast. Only animals that make babies using an "ovum" and "sperm" have a sex.
In humans, the sex of a person depends on what sex chromosomes that person has in his or her cells. All of a woman's ova already contain one X chromosome. A man's sperm contains either an X or a Y chromosome. When a sperm and ova combine to form a baby, the baby may get either of these chromosomes from its father. If the baby gets two X chromosomes, it will usually develop into a girl. If the baby gets one X and one Y, it will usually develop into a boy. There are exceptions to this rule, though. For example, sometimes a baby with XY chromosomes will not respond to the Y and develop as a girl.
Before babies are born, they grow either male sex parts or female sex parts. Very few people grow none or both, but some do. It's hard for these people because they often feel sad about people seeing them as being different. These people can be called intersexed people or hermaphrodites.
Sometimes, people feel that they are the other sex. For example, they have male sex parts but they feel like a woman. If they think really carefully about this, and think they should be the other sex, they can say they are a woman, and even get their sex parts changed to female sex parts. These people are called transgendered people.
