The Most Noble Order of the Garter (OG) is an English order of chivalry. It was started in 1348 by King Edward III of England. The Order is the highest level of knighthood that can be given by the English monarch. It is the world's oldest national order of knighthood. Membership in the Order is limited to those people who have done many great things for the United Kingdom.
The Order of the Garter is made up of a very small number of people. This group includes the Sovereign (the King or Queen of Britain) and no more than 25 full members. These members are called "Companions". Male companions are called "Knight Companions". Female members are called "Lady Companions". There are also a number of extra members known as "Supernumerary" Knights and Ladies. These members are usually members of the British Royal family and monarchs of other countries. Unlike other British Orders, the Sovereign is the only person who decides who is chosen to be a member of the Order of the Garter.
