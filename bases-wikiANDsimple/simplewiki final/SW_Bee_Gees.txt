The Bee Gees were an Australian singing group consisting of three brothers Barry Gibb (September 1, 1946-), and twins Maurice Gibb (December 22, 1949- January 12,2003) and Robin Gibb (December 22 1949-). They performed together for almost 40 years, but are most famous for their album, Saturday Night Fever, the soundtrack for the film of the same name. They supposedly stopped performing after Maurice's death. They have another younger brother, Andy Gibb, who is not in the Bee Gees. Andy died in 1988.
