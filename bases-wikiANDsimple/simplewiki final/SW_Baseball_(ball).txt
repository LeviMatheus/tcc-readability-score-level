A baseball is a ball used in the sport of the same name, baseball. It is between 9 inches (22.9 cm) and 9Â¼ inches (23.5 cm) in circumference. The ball weighs 5 ounces. Different size balls may be used in children's leagues.
The balls can be made in many different, but similar ways. The center of most balls is cork, rubber, or a mixture of the two. It is sometimes layered. Yarn and twine and sometimes wool is wrapped around the center core. A leather cover is put on, in two pieces, and stitched together using 108 stitches of waxed red cotton thread. Official Major League balls sold by Rawlings are made to the exact MLB specifications (5 ounces, 108 stitches).
