In Hinduism, sadhu is a common term for an ascetic or someone who practices yoga ("yogi"). Sadhus have given up trying to achieve the first three Hindu goals of life: kama (enjoyment), artha (practical objectives) and even dharma (duty). The sadhu is solely dedicated to achieving moksha (liberation) through meditation and contemplation of God. Sadhus often wear ochre-colored clothing, as a symbol that they have given up many things in life.
'SƒÅdhu!' is also a Sanskrit term used as an exclamation for something novel.
