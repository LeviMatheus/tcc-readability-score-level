The underworld is a term used in many religions and mythologies to refer to the place where people believed they would go after they died, or where their souls would go to after they died.
The underworld is most often thought of in relation to Greek mythology. The Ancient Greeks believed that the Hades was the God of the underworld. The Romans called him Pluto, a name which meant “The Wealthy One” because there were lots of minerals under the ground. The most famous story about the underworld is the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.
