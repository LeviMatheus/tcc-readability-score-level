A computer model is a computer program that is designed to simulate what might or what did happen in a situation. They are used in many ways including in astronomy, economics and sciences such as physics and biology.
Computer models can accurately predict many things in the future provided they have information data from previous similar situations. However they are not always 100% accurate.
