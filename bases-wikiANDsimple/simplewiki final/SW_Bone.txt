Bones are parts of the human or animal skeleton of vertebrates.
What they do.
The bones are the framework of the body, without them we would be a pile of skin on the floor. The bones are also very important for our own protection, that is, the rib cage protects the heart and lungs, cranium (skull) protects the brain, pelvis protects the reproductive organ. Bones need to be maintained by taking regular exercise and by having lots of calcium from foods like cheese,milk and dark leafy greens such as spinach. The red bone marrow in the middle of the bigger bones are what make the red blood cells that we need.
