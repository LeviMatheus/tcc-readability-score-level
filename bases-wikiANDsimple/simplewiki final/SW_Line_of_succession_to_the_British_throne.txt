The line of succession to the British throne is the order in which members of the royal family would come to the throne if the reigning king or queen died.
At present the first in line is Charles, Prince of Wales, followed by his elder son, Prince William of Wales and then his second son, Prince Harry of Wales.
The succession is decided firstly by gender and then by age. Males come before females, and older children come before younger children. When someone who is in line to the throne has a child, that child comes after them and their other children, but before anyone else in the line of succession.
