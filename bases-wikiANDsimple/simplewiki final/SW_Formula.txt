A formula is a shortened way of writing an idea. They are often in Mathematics and Science. Formulae (the plural) use letters instead of words. The simplest formula is y = x. Here, if x is, for example, 1, then y = x so y = 1. Possibly the most famous formula is E = m × c 2. Albert Einstein created this. In it, E is energy, m is mass and c is the speed of light. Thus, energy = mass × (multiplied by) the speed of light 2 (squared).
Usually the formula is use the same way in at all times. For example, the formula to find the area of a square is the length times its breadth.
