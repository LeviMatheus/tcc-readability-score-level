A daughter is the female child of a mother and father. The opposite of a daughter is a son. A daughter would be a sister, if she has siblings.
Daughter is also used informally to mean "junior". For example, in the Church of England, a parish with more than one church is sometimes said to have a mother church, which is the main parish church and a daughter church.
