Repulse Bay (Chinese: 淺水灣/浅水湾, Pinyin: "Qianshuiwan", literally "Shallow Water Bay") Repulse Bay is a very famous beach in Hong Kong. It is located in the southern part of Hong Kong Island.In 1841, a gang of pirates captured Repulse Bay and lived in there. They robbed the merchant ships of the goods frequently. In order to protect the traders, the British Fleet repulsed the pirates and attacked their base. Due to this incident, it was named as Repulse Bay. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, the name of Repulse Bay was changed to "綠ヶ濱".
