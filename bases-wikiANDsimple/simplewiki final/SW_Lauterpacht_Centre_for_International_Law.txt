The Lauterpacht Centre for International Law (LCIL) at the Faculty of Law, Cambridge, England, was founded in 1985 by Sir Elihu Lauterpacht under the name The Research Centre for International Law. It was renamed in 1997 “to honour the achievements of his father Sir Hersch Lauterpacht and himself”. The purpose of the centre is to "promote international law by a combination of individual and group research”. The centre is currently directed by Professor James Crawford SC, FBA.
