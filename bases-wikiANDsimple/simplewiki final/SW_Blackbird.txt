A blackbird (or Common Blackbird) is a type of bird. The main colour of the male's body is black, which is why it is called blackbird. Females are brown. Blackbirds are easy to find in gardens all over Europe and in Asia, South of the Arctic Circle. On average, Black birds live to be 2.4 years old, but some have been found to be 20 years old.
