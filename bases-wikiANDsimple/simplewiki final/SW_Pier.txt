A Pier is a raised walkway across water which are used to help control tides and currents. They can range from a simple light wooden structures which have no affect on the current and tides, and are just an extension across the water, to major structures which have buildings on the surface which can extend over a mile out to sea. In the United States, these may be referred to as docks.
