"An Inspector Calls" is a play written in 1944-5 by the British playwrite J. B. Priestley. It was first performed in 1946 in two Moscow theatres as no London theatres were available. It was then first produced in London at the New Theatre on 1 October 1946. It shows the way in which people are all connected, and reflects Priestley's socialist views whilst outlining the problems he saw with capitalism.
