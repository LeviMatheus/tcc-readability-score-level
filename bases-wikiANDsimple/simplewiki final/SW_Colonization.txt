Colonization is the act of one country settling another place, in order to become the new rulers of the new country, and to live in the new country.
In 1492, Christopher Columbus discovered The Americas. This is how the Europeans learned that North America and South America were there. The Europeans colonized the Americas. Because of this, most people now living in North America are the descendents of Europeans.
Sometimes, science fiction stories talk about humans colonizing outer space on space stations or planets other than Earth. Some science fiction stories like The Matrix speak of aliens colonizing Earth.
