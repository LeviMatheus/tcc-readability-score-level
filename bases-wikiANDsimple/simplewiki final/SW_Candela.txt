A candela measures how bright something is. It is one of the basic units of science. A light bulb is bright, but the Sun is much brighter, so the Sun has more candelas than the light bulb. Candelas are measured using green light, which human eyes are very sensitive to.
A candela sometimes has the name 'candle'.
