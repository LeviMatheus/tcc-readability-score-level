An icon, from the Greek word for image, is a picture of something holy or divine. Icons in this sense are in use mainly in Eastern Christianity. Look in the article Icon for this meaning.
Iconography is the study, mostly in art history, of the content of all types of images, their history and meaning. The word can also mean "symbolism".
In non-religious use an "icon" is a Pictogram for an object, facility, control, political party, government, or something like this. See Icon (secular).
