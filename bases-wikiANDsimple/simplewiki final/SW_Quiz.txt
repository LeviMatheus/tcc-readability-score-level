A quiz is a type of game or mind sport when the players (as individuals or in teams) try to answer questions correctly. Quizzes are also used in education and similar fields to improve the growth of someone knowledge, abilities, and/or skills.
Quizzes are usually scored in points. Many quizzes are designed for people to determine the winner of a group of participants - usually the participant with the highest score.
