The neolithic is the youngest part of the Stone Age. The word "neolithic" comes from two words in Greek: "neo", meaning "new" and "lithic", meaning "stone". The neolithic period is the time when farming was invented and when people started caring for animals, such as cows, sheep and pigs. The neolithic starts at different times in different places, since not everyone started farming at the same time. After the neolithic period comes the Bronze Age.
