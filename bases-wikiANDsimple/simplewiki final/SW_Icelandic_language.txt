Icelandic is the language spoken by the people of Iceland.
It is a Germanic language. It comes from the Old Norse language, the language spoken by the Vikings. Because Iceland is far away from other countries, the language hasn't changed much. Icelandic people can still read words from hundreds of years ago.
Icelandic uses two characters that aren't used in English: þ (thorn), (like 'th' in thin) and ð (edh), (like 'th' in this). It can also be said that ð is a "softer" version of þ.
Some linguists say there are only two Nordic languages, Eastern-Nordic and Western-Nordic, which includes Icelandic and Faroese because of their similarity.
