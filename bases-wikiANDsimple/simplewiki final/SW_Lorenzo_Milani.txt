Dedicated '..to those children who left school without basic skills - and to those teachers who believe that through their work they can make a difference in the lives of children'.
For his radical ideas, Milani was sent by his bishop into a sort of 'exile' in Barbiani. He started a full time school there for for children who had been failed or abandoned by the traditional education system. Eventually, hundreds of pupils of all ages were attracted to his teaching/methods. Artists, farmers, scientists, artisans and professionals were invited to give hands-on explanations of their acctivities. Students were also made to read and evaluate critically national & international news. The aim was to make students competent enough to be able to analyse events with a critical spirit in order to face life without fear and to solve problems with determination and consciousness.
