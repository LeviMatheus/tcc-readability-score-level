The Celtic League is a group of people from the six modern Celtic nations of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. They want their countries to be free. These six countries each have a native Celtic language and the Celtic League supports the learning of these languages. The six Celtic languages are Irish, Gaelic (Scottish), Welsh, Breton, Cornish, and Manx.
