A tank is a fighting machine. It is alternatively called an "armoured fighting vehicle" (AFV). It has armour to protect it from enemy's guns, missiles, and rifles and a cannon to fight the enemies. Tanks have tracks that wrap around its wheels to spread out its weight and let it cross rough ground. Most tanks have a powerful gun and one or more machine guns.
The first tanks were used by the British during World War I as a way of attacking enemy trenches. To hide the tanks real use from the Germans before they were used in battle, they were called tanks like the large containers for water or other liquids.
Tanks became a main weapon during World War II, where battles between great numbers of tanks were fought, especially between the Germans and the Soviet Union. Well-known World War II tanks were German Panzer IV, Panther and Tiger, Russian T-34 and JS-2, British Matilda, Churchill and Cromwell, and American Sherman and Stuart tanks.
Modern tanks have a small number of men inside, usually 3 to 5. Some light tanks can be dropped from airplanes and float. Heavy tanks often have special devices to see very far and in the dark. Some tanks have snorkels (air intake masts) to enable them to cross rivers underwater.
Old tanks are often used for other uses like carrying soldiers or bridges. Combat engineers use special tanks, for example minesweeper tanks or bridgelayer tanks.
The tank is a major part of many large armies today.
Large containers for water or other liquids are also called tanks.
