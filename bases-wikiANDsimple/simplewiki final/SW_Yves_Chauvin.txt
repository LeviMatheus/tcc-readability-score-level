Yves Chauvin (born October 10, 1930) is a French chemist. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005. He is honorary research director at the "Institut français du pétrole" and a member of the French Academy of Science. Chauvin received his degree from the Lyon's School of Chemistry, Physics and Electronics in 1954.
He was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, along with Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for his work from the early 1970s on olefin metathesis. Chauvin was embarrassed to receive his award and at first did not want to accept it. In the end, he accepted the award from the King of Sweden and gave a big speech.
