Microfabrication is made up of the words micro and fabrication. Micro is a prefix in SI and other systems of units denoting a factor of 10âˆ’6. So it means very small. Fabrication means making or producing goods, equipment, etc. from various different materials.
So microfabrication is a term that describes the manipulation of the process that is small-scale, micro-miniature, micromanufacturing micrometre size or structure. Historically the earliest micromanufacturing was used for semiconductor devices in integrated circuit fabrication and these processes have been covered by the term "semiconductor device fabrication," "semiconductor manufacturing," etc. A variety of devices and small arms in various fields of science and engineering presents a challenge: physics, chemistry, materials science, computer science, Ultra - precision engineering, manufacturing process and has designed equipment. It will create a wide variety of research.
The major concepts and principles of micromanufacturing are laser technology and microlithography.
