The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)) was a group of countries that came together (a federation). The federation was originally led by Vladmir Lenin and was a major, powerful country. The largest of these countries was Russia, followed by Ukraine. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. The Soviet Union existed from 1922 to 1991.
The nation's government said that it was a socialist country that wanted communism. "Sovjets", or workers' councils, were created to "speak" for the workers, and served as an elite group to control the workers.
Republics of the Soviet Union.
The Soviet Union was made of 15 republics. These were either "Soviet Socialist Republics", or "Soviet Socialist Federal Republics". Each of these republics was independent. It also had the right to leave the union. The "Federal Republics" were different in that they had more autonomy, and were made up of states themselves. These were often called "Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics". There were a number of them. Most of them still exist; though they are now republics, within the independent state. The "Tatar ASSR" turned into the "Republic of Tatarstan", for example (It is located around Kazan. Tatars make up 3.8% of the population of Russia)
