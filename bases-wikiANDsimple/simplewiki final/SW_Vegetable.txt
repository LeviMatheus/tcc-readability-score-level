A vegetable is part of a plant that is eaten by humans, but is not a fruit, nut, herb, spice, or grain. For example, carrots and cabbage are vegetables. Vegetables are an important part of people's diet (what they eat every day). Vegetables and fruits are sometimes called produce. Vegetables have vitamins A, B, C, D minerals and carbohydrates.
Other meanings.
The word "vegetable" can also be used to mean plants in general, such as when people say "Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral."
However, in an Asian context, 'vegetable' may mean any plant produce, apart from grain and nuts, that is consumed cooked, while only the fruits consumed raw are considered as 'fruits' in that sense. For example, a pumpkin is therefore considered a vegetable, while a melon qualifies as a fruit.
