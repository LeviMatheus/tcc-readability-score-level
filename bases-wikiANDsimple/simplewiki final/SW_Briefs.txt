Briefs are a type of underwear for boys and men. They provide a close fit and come in either white or in other colors like blue, pink, or red. Prior to the 2000s, briefs came in hard elastic waistband. This would cause stretch marks and this was eventually replaced by the soft elastic waistband. However, hard elastic waistbands are still found on generic store brand underwear (that save consumer and manufacturing costs by not being fashion forward).
