Ka is one of the five parts of the Egyptian idea of the soul. The Ka was the life force and left the body during death. Ka was believed to be in food and drink and was placed with the dead for offerings. The Egyptians believed that at death the Ba and the Ka join together through Nehebkau before entering Duat.
