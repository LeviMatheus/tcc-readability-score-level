An Iceberg is a large piece of ice floating in the water. Icebergs usually break off from larger structures made of ice, like glaciers or ice shelves. About 90% of the iceberg is below the water line. It is difficult to determine how that part looks, from looking at the part of the iceberg that is visible.
An iceberg was the cause of the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912.
