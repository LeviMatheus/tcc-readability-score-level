Live Earth was a series of concerts held on July 7, 2007, and were organized by Al Gore, who used to be the vice president. Inspired by Live Aid and Live 8, Live Earth was held to raise awareness about global warming. It was held in cities on every continent in the world, even Antarctica, and stars like Madonna and the Foo Fighters came out to help.
