Plants are living things. Plants are not animals so they do not need to eat other living things to live. They are usually fixed to one location in the ground.
Plants make food for themselves using sunlight, water, certain minerals (nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous), and carbon dioxide. They are one of five big groups (kingdoms) of living things.
Plants grow upward. The heat from the sunlight pulls the water and food from the ground through the roots, and toward tiny holes at the other end of the plant. These little holes are mostly on the plant's leaves. This is called transpiration.
The word "plant" can also mean to put something in the ground. For example, farmers plant seeds in the ground.
Flowering plants.
Plants need sunlight to grow green. If plants are grown without sunlight they turn yellow and grow tall. This is because they are looking for sunlight which boosts the plant's chlorophyll levels which, in turn, help it grow green.
Plants generally produce flowers and flowers produce nice smells, unless they produce bad smells.
