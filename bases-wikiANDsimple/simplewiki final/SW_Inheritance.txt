Inheritance is the practice of passing on property, titles, debts, and obligations when someone dies. Inheritance has been very important in human societies for a long time.
If only sons and other male family members get the inheritance, it is called patrilineal succession. If only daughters and other female family members get the inheritance, it is called matrilineal succession.
The person who gets the property and other things when someone dies is called the heir.
