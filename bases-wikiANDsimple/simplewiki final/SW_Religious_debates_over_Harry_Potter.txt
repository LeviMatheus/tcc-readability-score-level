There have been many religious debates over "Harry Potter" because of the witchcraft in it. Some religious groups think the Harry Potter books go against their god because they represent witchcraft or are Satanic (meaning anti-God).
In the United States, people tried to get the books banned in schools. Their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion, so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state. This was then brought up in court as being against the Freedom of Religion.
Many people have said that the books do not resemble real witchcraft. They say that the witchcraft in Harry Potter is the same as in "The Chronicles of Narnia" and "The Lord of the Rings", which are often thought of as Christian books.
