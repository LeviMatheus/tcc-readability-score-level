The Lesser Bandicoot rat is a rodent. It lives in south Asia. It can grow up to 40cm long. It is a rat, but is not in the genus "Rattus", but in the genus "Bandicota". Many see it as a pest to cereal crops, and gardens in India and Sri Lanka. When attacking the rat grunts like a pig. Their fur is darker brown on the back (dorsally, as scientists say), and usually ligher or darker grey on the belly-side (ventrally). The length of their body is about 25 centimetres, and the tail is shorter than the body.
Location.
Sometimes, the rats live in abandoned houses in villages. When they feel threatened, they are very aggressive. Many also see them as a threat to infants (babies). Packs of Lesser Bandicoot rats have been known to attack and devour infants left alone.
