Arrest.
Official sources in Belgrade reported that he had been arrested in Serbia and brought before Belgrade's War Crimes Court. There had been an international arrest warrant against Karadžić for more than a decade. The tribunal looking into war crimes in the Yugoslav war said there were reasons to believe Karadžić had committed war crimes. This includes genocide, mainly directed against Muslims. The United States government had offered a $5 million award for information that led to his arrest, and that of Ratko Mladić. Karadžić was arrested and arraigned at a Serbian court on July 21, 2008.
The film "The Hunting Party" was based on Karadzic's life as a fugitive.
