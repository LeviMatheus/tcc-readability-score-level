Nova Scotia is a small province located on the East Coast of Canada. The capital of Nova Scotia is Halifax, which is also the province's biggest city. Right now, over 900,000 people live in Nova Scotia, which is about the size of Calgary, Alberta. People who live in Nova Scotia are called Nova Scotians.
Many people in Nova Scotia do not live in large cities or towns but villages, where few people live. This is also called rural.
Nova Scotia's government is a democracy. Rodney MacDonald is the premier and Mayann Francis is the lieutenant governor.
What is now called "Nova Scotia" used to be controlled by the Micmac Indians. The French settled among them at Port Royal after 1600, and called the land part of Acadia. In the 1700s there was a war between Britain and France, and Acadia went to Britain and ended up becoming a colony of Scotland. The name "Nova Scotia" is Latin for "New Scotland".
