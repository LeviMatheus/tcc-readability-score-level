Biography.
Sydney was born in London on November 30th 1991, and has always loved singing and acting. She first attended Broomfield House School in Kew and bullied her somewhat skeptical parents into taking her to the renowned children's agency Young'uns. They took her on and following her very first audition she was offered the role of Cosette in Les Miserables. The following year she undertook four performances per week at London's Palace Theatre fitting schoolwork around them. Sydney then auditioned for the world-famous Sylvia Young Theatre School, and was thrilled to win one of the few precious places, starting in September 2002.
Sydney lives in West London with her parents, two older brothers (Paul and Adam) and two younger brothers (Cameron and Spike). She also has a dog called Digger. She won a prestigious LAMDA award in 2003, and admits she's keen to win an Oscar!
