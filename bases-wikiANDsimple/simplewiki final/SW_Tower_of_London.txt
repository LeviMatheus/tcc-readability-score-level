The Tower of London is an ancient stone fortress in London, England. It stands on the bank of the River Thames, in the oldest part of the city. The crowns and other jewelery worn by the Queen on ceremonial days, the Crown Jewels, are kept there.
The Tower of London was built in 1078 by King William I, the Duke of Normandy, who had conquered England 12 years before. The moat was built by King Richard I of England, using water from the River Thames.
The Tower of London has traditionally been guarded by ravens, large fierce black birds with sharp beaks. Many still live at the Tower and are taken care of by the staff who work there. Birds' names include "Hardey", "Thor", "Odin", "Gwyllum", "Reginald", "Cedric", "Huggin" and "Muggin". The ravens' wing feathers are kept short so they cannot fly away. This is because a legend (story) says that if the ravens leave the Tower, the Tower and the Kingdom will fall.
The closest Underground station to the Tower of London is Tower Hill.
