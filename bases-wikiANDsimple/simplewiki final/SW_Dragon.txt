The "dragon" is a fictional animal belonging to the world of mythology, story telling and fantasy. We find stories about dragons in the Chinese culture, the European culture, South American culture, and many others.
Because dragons can look like dinosaurs and other extinct (not living any more) animals of millions of years ago, it is easy to think that those animals might have been an example for dragons as they were thought of in the history of humankind.
Some of dragons are considered dangerous and eat humans, but many other stories have majestic dragons who are looking for help, giving help, or interact with the main character(s) in a peaceful way.
Chinese dragon.
In China, a dragon is usually described as a supernatural (magical) animal that has a long body like a snake. The Chinese dragon has four feet and four toes in each foot. Unlike dragons of European legend, the Chinese dragon was considered a symbol of luck. Chinese dragons are thought of with respect.
In ancient China a dragon was a symbol of the emperor.
