The Boeing 767 is a passenger airplane manufactured by Boeing. The Boeing 767 is Boeing's smallest widebody (an aircraft which has two aisles), larger than the Boeing 757 but smaller than the 777. The passengers sit two across, aisle, three across, aisle, and then two across.
The first airplane, American Airlines, Flight 11 to hit the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 was a Boeing 767.
American, United, Delta, Continental, British Airways and other airlines operate Boeing 767s. The 767 can have engines supplied by Rolls-Royce, General Electric or Pratt and Whitney.
The Boeing 767 was produced from 1981 and remains in production today. Since the late 1990s it has not sold well because of the much better Airbus A330-200. Boeing will replace the 767 with the 787.
