One day, on 28 April 1996, a man started shooting at people at the Broad Arrow Cafe. Wendy Scurr rushed in to see the man who was killing people and she called the police to tell them. Police did not believe her, so she told them to listen to the gun shots. Wendy Scurr has given a full account of what she observed on that day.
