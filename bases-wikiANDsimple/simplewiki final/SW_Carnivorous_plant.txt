Carnivorous plants (sometimes called insectivorous plants) are plants that get some or most of their nutrients (but not energy) from trapping and eating animals or protozoans, typically insects and other arthropods. Because they get some of their nutritients from animals, carnivorous plants can grow in places where the soil is thin or poor in nutrients. This is especially true for soils with little nitrogen, such as acidic bogs and rock outcroppings. Charles Darwin wrote the first well-known treatise on carnivorous plants in 1875.
True carnivory probably evolved in at least ten separate lineages of plants. There are now over a dozen genera in five families. These include about 625 species that attract and trap prey, produce digestive enzymes, and absorb the resulting available nutrients. Additionally, over 300 protocarnivorous plant species in several genera show some but not all of these characteristics.
Trapping mechanisms.
These traps may be active or passive, depending on whether movement aids the capture of prey. For example, "Triphyophyllum" is a passive flypaper that secretes mucilage, but whose leaves do not grow or move in response to prey capture. Meanwhile, sundews are active flypapers whose leaves undergo rapid growth, which helps the capture and digestion of prey.
