The flag of the Dominican Republic, as described by Article 95 of the Dominican Constitution, has a white cross in the center that extends to the sides of the flag and divides the flag into four rectangles â€”the left rectangles are blue (top) and red, and the right ones are red (top) and blue. The width of the white cross is half the height of one of the rectangles.
The National Flag, equivalent to the state and war flags of other Latin American countries, has a small coat of arms in the center of the white cross but there is not a coat of arms in the ensign (the one used by commercial ships).
The Dominican flag was created the first day of Independence (27 February 1844); it was created from the Haitian flag but adding a white cross; that is, two blue rectangles on the top and two red rectangles on the bottom. The colors are from the French flag. That was the "First National Flag".
The first Dominican Constitution of 6 November 1844 did not say anything about the distribution of the rectangles but from the start the flag was represented with alternation of the colors; this is the "Second National Flag". Only the Constitution of 1908 is specific about the color distribution.
