Creationism is the belief that God (or another higher form) created the universe, like it says in the Bible, Torah, Qur'an, or other religious books.
"Creationists", people who believe in creationism which says that all today's living things came about from simple organisms changing slowly over time. Creationists usually believe that life was created much as it is today, and that one form of life cannot change into another. There are things that show evolution, such as fossils, the remains of living things that died long ago. Older living things seen in fossils are different from the life we see today, and can be put into order to show changes over time. Creationists say that this and other things are not enough and argue that virtually every living thing that has a fossil counterpart is practically identical to it. They also argue that the order is arbitrary because there is no place on earth where the rock layers are completely in tact.
Some people do not believe their religious book to be word-for-word true, and say God used evolution to create life. This idea is called theistic evolution. Others believe that evolution alone created life.
Almost all scientists, as well as the United States courts say that creationism is not part of science.
