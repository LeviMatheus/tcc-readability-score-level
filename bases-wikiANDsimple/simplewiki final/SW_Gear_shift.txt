The gear shift is the part of the gearbox which has the shift forks and allows the contact from the driver to the synchronisation.
Most of the time they are so much like the gear counter plus the reverse gear. And they make it possible to choose the gear (gear ratio) and to switch this in or out. The invention of the gear shift is attributed to Karl Benz.
