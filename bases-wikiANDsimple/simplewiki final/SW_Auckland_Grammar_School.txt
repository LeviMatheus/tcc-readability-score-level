History Background.
Auckland Grammar School was first set up in 1868 by Sir George Grey. He was the governor of New Zealand from 1861-1868. During that time, the new European settlers were fighting with the Maori people over land rights issues. The Governor of New Zealand asked for military help from the British Empire. Britain sent up to one million soldiers to New Zealand to end the problems. Many of the soldiers settled with their families in Auckland. Sir George Grey decided to create Auckland Grammar School to give a very good education to the soldiers' sons.
Rules.
People of all classes or racial background who live in New Zealand are all the same when it comes to being allowed to go to the school. The school believes it is very important to teach many different languages and, in particular, 'the instructing in Latin.' The school tries to get all of the students to do very well in all educational areas, for example, Academic, Sporting and Cultural fields. The school does however show some disregard for national educational standards. Auckland Grammar is considered one of the more "uptight" schools in the Auckland region offering conforming students the best education.
