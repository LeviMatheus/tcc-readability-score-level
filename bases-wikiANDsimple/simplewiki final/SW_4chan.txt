4chan is an English language imageboard website based on the Japanese Futaba Channel. It was started in 2003 by "moot", who was 15 years old then, and who said his real name is Christopher Poole in 2008. On the website, users post pictures and discuss them. When the site started it was for discussing Anime and Manga, but now many other topics are discussed. One of the boards on the site, called "/b/", is dedicated to random discussions and is often mentioned in media. Several Internet memes have started at 4chan, including lolcats and rickrolling.
