"Repo Man" is a 1984 comedy/science fiction movie starring Emilio Estevaz and Harry Dean Stanton. It was writen and directed by Alex Cox. The movie is about the life of a repo man, a person who steals cars legally from people who do not pay for them.
The movie is well thought of for several reasons. First, it has talk and events that are both funny and strange. The music played in the movie is also a very good collection of punk rock music that was popular at the time. Also, the movie is not similar to most other movies that were made at the same time.
