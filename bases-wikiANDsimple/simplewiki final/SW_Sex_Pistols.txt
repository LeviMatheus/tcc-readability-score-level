The Sex Pistols were the first popular punk group in Britain. They were only together for two years in the late 1970s and they were known for their rowdy behavior more than their music. The music they made gave many new artists a big influence on their music, mostly in the alternative music and punk scenes. Members in the band: Johnny Rotten- vocals, Paul Cook- drums, Steve Jones- guitar, Glen Matlock- bass. Sid Vicious later replaced Matlock on bass. They recorded only one studio album, called Never Mind the Bollocks - Here's the Sex Pistols. One of their most famous songs is Anarchy In The UK.
