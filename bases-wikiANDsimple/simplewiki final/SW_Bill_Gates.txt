William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955), commonly known as Bill Gates, is the co-founder and Chief of Microsoft. He was the richest person in the world for many years. When Bill was 13 he went to Lakeside School. He was a freshman at Harvard in 1973. He left Harvard University to make software. Bill Gates saw an opportunity to transform the personal computer, which used to be a hard-to-use and expensive device. He saw that computers could be made less expensive and more easy to use.
He recently decided to quit from his job at Microsoft, and is doing more charity work with his wife, Melinda. Many people are disappointed in the decision he's making about leaving Microsoft. Bill Gates' philanthropy projects have included vaccination of children in sub-Saharan Africa, scholarship programs in the United States, and leadership to help organize other billionaires to redistribute their wealth. He likes to give money and support to human rights, education and technological innovation. Bill Gates stepped down from his CEO position in Microsoft in 1998 and Steve Ballmer did the job instead. On June 16 2007, Microsoft said that Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, will come in on a day to day schedule to continue working with his charity organization full time for the years to come.
