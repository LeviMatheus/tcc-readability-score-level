The Mali Federation was a country in the west of Africa. Senegal and Mali came together and made this country. (Mali's name was French Sudan at that time). It started on April 4 1959 and it was controlled by France. However, it became independent on June 20 1960.
The Federation's prime minister was Modibo Keita, and the government was in Dakar. The Federation ended a short time after independence because Senegal left on August 20 1960 because they had a disagreement about politics.
