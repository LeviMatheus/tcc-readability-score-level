The United States Marine Corps (also known as USMC) is one of the 5 branches of the military of the United States in the United States Department of Defense. It was created in 1775 as a special service -- though it is part of the U.S. Navy, it has its own special structure. The Marines have been involved in many conflicts, and had important roles in key battles such as Tripoli, Iwo Jima, Guadalcanal, and Inchon Bay. Every Marine receives infantry training so he or she can be battle ready at all times. Marine Corps boot camp is also known for being especially challenging.
