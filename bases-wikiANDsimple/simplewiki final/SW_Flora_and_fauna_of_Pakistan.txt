The land of Pakistan including Jammu and Kashmir has varied eco-zones resulting in varied fauna and flora.
Current condition.
Vast Indus plains have had vegetation taken away to grow crops. Very little wildlife lives there and only animals like the jackal, mongoose, jungle cat, civet cat, scaly anteater, desert cat and the wild hare live in these areas.
Parts of Thal desert and Cholistan desert are now being irrigated. The Chinkara is the only animal living there now. The blackbuck, who lived there once in big numbers, is now extinct. However, efforts are being made to reintroduce them back into the country.
Irrigated forest plantations are now being made. These give very good conditons for chinkara, hog deer and blue bull to live in.
The striped hyena and the wolf are found almost everywhere in the country. However, little is known about the black bear and brown bear populations.
Birds of prey like the peregrine, cherrug or saker falcons, tawny eagle, imperial and greater spotted eagles, osprey, shikra, and the black-winged kite live throughout Pakistan but their population statuses are unknown.
