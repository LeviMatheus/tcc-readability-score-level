To swim is to move through water. People swim using their arms and/or legs. Swimming can be divided into several "strokes": breaststroke, front crawl, butterfly, and backstroke are some of them. The freestyle, in competition, is a swim race where the racers can swim any of the four strokes. Almost everyone chooses front crawl. Swimmers move through the water using the combination of other body parts. Swimmers need to be able to stay above water and sometimes be able to hold their breath for a long time. A person needs to be healthy if it wants to do it as a sport.
Swimming can be done for fun, for exercise, or as a competitive sport. Many Schools use swimming as a physical training exercise or just to have some fun after a hard week in the gym or outside.
