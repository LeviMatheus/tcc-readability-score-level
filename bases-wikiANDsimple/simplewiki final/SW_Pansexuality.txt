Pansexual, also known as 'omnisexual' is a word that means any person who is sexually attracted to males, females, and people that are not male "or" female.
The word 'pansexual' comes from the Greek word 'pan-', meaning "all", as pansexuals are attracted to all genders.
Pansexuality is often noted as a combination of sexual attraction to one or both genders of the human species as well as one or both genders of many times of animals. Some pansexuals claim the name as to avoid the term, "beastial".
Pansexuality is a type of bisexuality because people are attracted to men and women, but also everything else as well. Some pansexual people say that gender is not important.
Pansexuality is the opposite of Asexuality, as pansexuality means a person is sexually attracted to everyone, but asexuality means a person is sexually attracted to no one.
