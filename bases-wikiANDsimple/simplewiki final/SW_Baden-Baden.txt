History.
The springs of Baden-Baden were known to the Romans, and the foundation of the town is referred to the emperor Hadrian by an inscription of somewhat doubtful authenticity. The name of Aurelia Aquensis was given to it in honour of Aurelius Severus, in whose reign it would seem to have been well known. Fragments of its ancient sculptures are still to be seen, and in 1847 remains of Roman vapour baths, well preserved, were discovered just below the New Castle.
In 1931, the town of Baden-Baden was officially given its double name (a short form for "Baden in Baden", i.e. Baden in the state of Baden). In both World Wars, the town escaped destruction. After World War II, Baden-Baden became the headquarters of the French forces in Germany and the site of a displaced persons camp.
From September 23 to September 28 1981, the XIth Olympic Congress took place in the "Kurhaus" in Baden-Baden.
The Baden Airpark is located 15 km west of Baden-Baden.
The Russian writer Dostoevsky wrote "The Gambler" while gambling at the famous Baden-Baden Casino.
