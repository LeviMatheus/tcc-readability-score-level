Amnesia is a what doctors call a loss or disturbance of memory. The condition can have various causes. The causes can be organic or functional.
Damage to the brain, or the use of certain drugs can cause amnesia. Some of these drugs are sedatives. Another well known cause for amnesia can be drinking too much alcohol.
Functional causes generally do not have a directly visible cause. Rather they are psychological in their nature. People may want to shield off a traumatic event they witnessed.
