A Lunar eclipse is an astronomical phenomenon. It occurs when the moon passes through the shadow of the Earth. Lunar eclipses occur about twice a year, much more often than solar eclipses. They also last longer than solar eclipses
During a lunar eclipse, the Moon appears a reddish-brown color. You would probably think that the moon would be completely black because of Earth's shadow, but the reddish-brown color is due to the fact that the Sun's light reflects off Earth, and is barely visible on the Moon.
Like solar eclipses, there are different types of lunar eclipses. There are total eclipses, where all of the moon appears reddish-brown, and partial ones, where only part of the moon appears reddish-brown.
Lunar eclipses don't happen every month due to the fact that the Moon's orbit is tilted.
