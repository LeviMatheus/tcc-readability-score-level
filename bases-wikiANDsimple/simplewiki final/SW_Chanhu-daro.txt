People lived in the settlement between 4000-1700 BC. Chanhudaro is believed to have been a centre for manufacturing carnelian beads.
Digging first started in Chanhudaro in the middle of the 1930s by the American School of Indic and Iranian Studies and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. After the independence of Pakistan, Mohammed Rafique Mughal also did work in the area.
