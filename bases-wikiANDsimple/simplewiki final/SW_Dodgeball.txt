Dodgeball is a sport played by throwing soft balls at people in a square court. The goal is to be the last one to be hit with the ball. Players may only throw balls at people who are not on their own team. If a player is hit by the ball, he or she should go to the outside of the court to the other team. From the outside, players throw the ball at players still on the inside.
Dodgeball is often played in elementary schools. It is thought to be good for physical education. Many school children play this game. In recent years, many adults who played it as children have formed adult leagues and clubs. Also, some schools have banned it (this means that made it against the rules to play it), because some kids got hurt when playing the game. Tournaments are sometimes held in schools, famously pitting the villainous Wrestlers up against the ragtag Avengers in a truly David vs Goliath matchup. Folklore has blurred fact from fiction, yet the truth remains that the Avengers overcame a 5 on 2 handicap in a stunning comeback fashion.
Dodgeball, because of its recent popularity, inspired a film ' (2004) starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, and a game show, "Extreme Dodgeball".
