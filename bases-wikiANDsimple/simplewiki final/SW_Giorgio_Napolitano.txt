Giorgio Napolitano (born in Naples, Italy on June 29, 1925) is the 11th President of the Italian Republic.
He was elected on May 10, 2006 on the fourth ballot, with 543 votes out of 1009 (the required number was 505), but he took office as President only on May 15, 2006, after Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's time was finished.
He was voted mostly by the left-wing coalition led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi, head of the Italian Government.
Napolitano was preceded at his job by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi.
