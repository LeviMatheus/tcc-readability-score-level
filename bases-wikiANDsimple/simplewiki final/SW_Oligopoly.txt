In economics, an oligopoly is when a market is controlled by a small number of sellers. Very often, there are only 3 or 4 of them. Oligopolies are very common. The main feature of the oligopoly is that a decision made by one market player influences the whole market.
Examples.
In many countries, some country-held companies were privatized. Very often, this privatization lead to oligopolies. In many countries, there are only a handful of companies providing networks for mobile phones. They control the prices for accessing the network. That is why using a mobile phone is often much more expensive than using a land line one.
