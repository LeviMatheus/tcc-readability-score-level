The district of Aachen ("Kreis Aachen") is a Kreis (district) in the west of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The city of Aachen is not part of the district.
History.
The modern district was made in 1975 by joining the old districts of Aachen and Monschau, and some parts of the districts of D端ren, J端lich and Schleiden as well as the Selfkant district.
Coat of arms.
The top of the coat of arms shows the black lion, the sign of J端lich, as the district contains mostly former parts of the duchy of J端lich. In the bottom the swan on a deer antler is the sign of the city of Burtscheid, which was the capital of the district until it was incorporated into the city of Aachen.
