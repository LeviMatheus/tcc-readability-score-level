Niccolò Machiavelli (May 3, 1469 – June 21, 1527) was a political philosopher, born in Florence, Italy.
Machiavelli is known today as the author of "The Prince". This book has influenced the practice of politics and the pursuit of power in modern history.
Machiavelli's best known book is The Prince, in which he describes the arts by which a Prince (a ruler) can retain control of his realm. He focuses primarily on what he calls the "new prince", under the assumption that a hereditary prince has an easier task since the people are accustomed to him. All a hereditary prince needs to do is carefully maintain the institutions that the people are used to; a new prince has a much more difficult task since he must stabilize his newfound power and build a structure that will endure. This task requires the Prince to be publicly above reproach but privately may require him to do immoral things in order to achieve his goals.
