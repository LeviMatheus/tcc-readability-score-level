"The Divine Comedy" is an epic poem (a poem that is very long, like a story) written by Dante Alighieri. It is about a trip through the afterlife. The poem is three parts long - the three parts are "Inferno" (Hell), "Purgatorio" (Purgatory), and "Paradiso" (Paradise, or Heaven). "Inferno" is the most famous section of the poem. The poem is about the travels of a man through Christian hell (place for bad people in Christianity), purgatory (place for people who have been bad but not bad enough to go to hell), and heaven (place for people who lived by the rules of Christianity). Note that comedy does not mean funny, yet more like not ending with a bad thing.
