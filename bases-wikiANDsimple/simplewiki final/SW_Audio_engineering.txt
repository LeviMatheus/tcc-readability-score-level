Audio engineering deals with the recording and reproduction of sound through mechanical and electronic means and is a part of audio science.
The field draws on many disciplines, including electrical engineering, acoustics, psychoacoustics, and music. An audio engineer is closer to the creative and technical aspects of audio than an acoustical engineer.
