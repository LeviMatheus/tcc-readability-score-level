This is a list of National Hockey League (NHL) statistical leaders through the end of the 2006–07 season. Statistics from the 2007–08 season will be included after that season is completed.
Most of these records are held by Canadian players, due to the traditional popularity of ice hockey in Canada. In the past, most NHL players were from Canada, and even today roughly half of all NHL players are born in Canada (52.0% in the 2007–08 season). To distinguish players of different nations, a flag is placed beside players born outside of Canada; the Canadian flag () will not be shown next to Canadian players in order to avoid clutter.
