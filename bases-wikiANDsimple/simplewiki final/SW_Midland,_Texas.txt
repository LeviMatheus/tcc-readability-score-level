Midland is a city in the American state of Texas. It is called Midland, because many years ago it was the midway point between two bigger cities in Texas, Fort Worth and El Paso. Oil was discovered in the region in 1923 and is still a larger part of the economy. Midland is also famous as the childhood home of The US President George W. Bush and his wife Laura, who was born there. Midland was also home to former president George H. W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Walker Bush.
