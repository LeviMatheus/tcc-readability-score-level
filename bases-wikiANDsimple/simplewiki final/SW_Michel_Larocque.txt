Michel 'Bunny' Larocque (April 6, 1952 in Hull, Quebec, Canada - July 29, 1992) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, and St. Louis Blues in the National Hockey League.
Playing career.
Larocque would help win four Vezina Trophies. During that time, the trophy was given to the main goaltenders on the team allowing the fewest goals in the regular season. The first three were mostly because of the all-star play of Ken Dryden. The final trophy was with Denis Herron and Richard Sevigny in 1981. He would win four Stanley Cups with Montreal in 1976, 1977, 1978, and 1979.
