Good Hair Day (also called ghd) is an English hair styling company. It is the UK's leading maker of hair irons and hair products.
Ownership.
Owned by Jemella Group, the company was started in 2001 by Martin Penny, Gary Douglas and Robert Powls.. In 2007, after being sold to Lloyds Development Capital, Jemella was re-sold 11 months later to Montagu Private Equity group for â‚¤160 million.
Famosity.
The reason the company is famous is because of its "iconic" line of hair irons, which have been described as "one of the most successful hair products in history" by the Yorkshire Post.. Their popularity, becoming a "fashion 'must-have'" is because of their celebrity fans, such as Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Victoria Beckham. As a result, Martin Penny won the The North Region Consumer Products Entrepreneur of the Year in 2005 for the product, and Consumer Products Entrepreneur Of The Year. The product has been involved with many fashion shows, such as New York Fashion Week, Alice McCall, and Willow Lingerie, and also sponsored the 2004 season of reality TV program The Salon.
Marketing.
GHD became famous through the use of its advertising campaign 'A new religion for hair'.
Products.
The irons have 'ceramic' on their heating plates, which is why the plates look golden, instead of silver. The technology involves using ceramic on the blades rather than just traditional metal which reduces the frizzing and damaging impacts on the hair caused by the severe heat.
GHD does however sell hair repair treatments and some other cremes to help the burnt hair.
Modern use of the word.
Recently, as the popularity of GHDs have grown in the UK, the word 'GHD' as an acronym has in fact been absorbed into the language. As well as being used as the name of the product, "GHD'd hair" is often referred to as any straightened hair, so is in this way an adjective. Other uses include the word as a verb, so a person can "GHD their hair", which means they have straightened their hair.
