The Lincoln Memorial was built to remember Abraham Lincoln, who was the 16th President of the United States and led the nation during the American Civil War. It is in the National Mall in Washington, D.C., and is a popular site for tourists.
Design.
The Lincoln Memorial was built to look like the Temple of Zeus at Olympia, Greece. It is surrounded by thirty six columns which are high. There is a large reflecting pool right outside the steps.
Inside.
A sculpture of Lincoln sitting on a throne is inside the Memorial. The statue shows the President looking towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument. The statue is 19 feet 9 inches (6 m) tall and wide, and was carved from 28 blocks of white marble.
AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE
FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION
This is a complicated sentence and was written long ago. It means that Abraham Lincoln will forever be remembered here, just like he will be remembered by the people of the United States, who he saved.
Lincoln's famous speech, the Gettysburg Address, is written into one of the walls at the Memorial. There are also several murals on the other walls. One of the murals shows an angel, and another one shows a slave being freed.
Famous Events.
The Memorial has been used many times for famous events. Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream" speech was given on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. President Richard Nixon once met with protesters of the Vietnam War, who were at the Memorial.
The Lincoln Memorial on U.S. currency.
The Lincoln Memorial is on the back of the United States penny (the one cent coin), which has a picture of Lincoln on the front. The memorial is also on the back of the U.S. five dollar bill, which also has a picture of Lincoln on the front.
