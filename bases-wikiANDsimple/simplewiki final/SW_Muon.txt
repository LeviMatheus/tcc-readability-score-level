The Muon is an elementary particle. It has a negative electric charge and half spin.
The Muon has a life time of 2.2 microseconds or 0.0000022 seconds.
A muon is like an electron but it is bigger.
How are muons made?
Muons are made in particle accelarators.
1. The photons in the cosmic rays crash into air atoms.
2. Pions are made in the crash
3. The pions decay into neutrinos and muons.
