Daft Punk is a band from France. There are two people in the band, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born February 8, 1974) and Thomas Bangalter (born January 3, 1975). Daft Punk use computers to make their music.
How the members met and Darlin' era.
Both of the two Daft Punk's members studied in the same Lyc√©e in Paris.
They became friends and recorded a demo track with other students from the school. Thomas Bangalter played bass while Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo played guitar.
They formed a band called Darlin' and the tracks that this band did were released by Stereolab.
The Darlin' experience didn't last very long and after a show they performed in the United Kingdom, a newspaper qualified the music of Thomas and Guy-Manuel as "daft punk" (silly punk music).
Thomas and Guy-Manuel were amused by this nickname and officially adopted it, and that's how they became the well known Daft Punk.
First Album: Homework.

After that success, Daft Punk looked for a manager, and the chose Pedro Winter aka Busy P.

Second Album: Discovery.
