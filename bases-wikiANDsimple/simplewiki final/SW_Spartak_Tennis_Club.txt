The Spartak Tennis Club is a tennis training ground located near Sokolniki Park in Moscow, Russia. It has 15 outdoor clay courts, which remain closed for half of the year, and only one indoor court. Its aging facilities, however, belie its success in training top Russian tennis players; Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Marat Safin, Elena Dementieva, Dinara Safina, Anastasia Myskina, and Anna Kournikova are all graduates of Spartak.
