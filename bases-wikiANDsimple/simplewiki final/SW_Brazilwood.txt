Brazilwood or Pau-Brasil, sometimes known as Pernambuco ("Caesalpinia echinata" syn. "Guilandina echinata" (Lam.) Spreng.) is a Brazilian tree. It has a dense, orange-red wood (which takes a high shine), and it is the most frequently used wood for making bows for string instruments from the violin family. The wood also gives a red dye called brazilin.
