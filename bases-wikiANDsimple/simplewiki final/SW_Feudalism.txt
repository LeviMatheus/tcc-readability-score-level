Feudalism is a system by which a nobility of warriors ruled Europe during the Middle Ages. The nobility owned the land and ruled the peasantry by bonds of manorialism, the division of the lord's lands.
Outside of a European context, the concept of feudalism is normally only used by analogy (called semi-feudal), most often in discussions of Japan under the shoguns, and, sometimes, medieval and Gondarine Ethiopia. Some have seen something like feudalism in places as different as Ancient Egypt, Parthian empire, India, to the American South of the nineteenth century.
Characteristics.
Three primary elements characterised feudalism: lords, vassals and fiefs; the structure of feudalism can be seen in how these three elements fit together. A lord was a noble who owned land, a vassal was a person who was granted possession of the land by the lord, and the land was known as a fief. In exchange for the fief, the vassal would provide military service to the lord. The obligations and relations between lord, vassal and fief form the basis of feudalism.
