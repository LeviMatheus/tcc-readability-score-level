Yeast are eucaryotic microorganisms. They are classified as fungi. There are about 1,500 different species of yeast. Most reproduce asexually, by budding. Some use binary fission to reproduce. This is also asexual reproduction.
A certain kind of yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used for a very long time. It is used for baking bread, for example, or as an additive to help the fermentation of alcoholic drinks, such as beer. It is also considered to be a model organism for modern cell biology. Other yeasts can cause infections in humans (they are pathogens). Yeast has also been used to make electricity, or to make ethanol (as a biological fuel for cars).
