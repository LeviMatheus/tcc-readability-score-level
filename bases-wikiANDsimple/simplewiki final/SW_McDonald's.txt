McDonald's is a chain of fast food restaurants found all over the world. They mainly serve hamburgers, cheeseburgers, chicken products, French fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes and desserts.
History.
McDonald's has been around since 1955, when it was started by Ray Kroc in Des Plaines, Illinois. Kroc had bought the previous company from Dick and Maurice (Mac) McDonald, who opened their restaurant in 1940. This first restaurant was on Route 66 in San Bernardino, California.
McDonald's is the world's largest fast food chain, and it is a worldwide corporation. McDonald's can be found in 120 countries and territories around the world. They serve almost 54 million people each day.
Most McDonald's hamburgers are sold in the United States and the second largest number in Europe.
The restaurants are either operated by the company or more commonly under a Franchising arrangement, where the business is owned and operated by an individual to the standards set by McDonald's and with support from the McDonald's company. The company provides a central source of supply for food items and standardized menu.
Mascot.
The McDonald's mascot is Ronald McDonald.
