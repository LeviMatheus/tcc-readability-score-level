A rook, (, from Persian رخ "rokh", Sanskrit "rath", "chariot") also known as a castle, is a piece in the board game of chess. Each player starts the game with two rooks, one in each of the corners nearest their own side. Even though the piece was mostly known as the "castle" in 17th and 18th century England, it is no longer used by chess players.
Starting place and moving.
In algebraic notation, the white rooks start on the "a1" and "h1" squares, and the black rooks start on the "a8" and "h8" squares. The rook moves forward or back through any number of squares without other pieces on them, as shown in the diagram. Like other pieces, it captures by going into the square on which an enemy piece stands. The rook also takes part in a special move called castling, along with the king.
