The 1992 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific season on record. The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki, which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands. Hurricanes Lester, Virgil, Winifred, and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people, but were significantly less destructive. Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico, without making landfall. Also of note are Hurricane Ekeka and Tropical Storm Hali, which formed in late January and March, respectively.
