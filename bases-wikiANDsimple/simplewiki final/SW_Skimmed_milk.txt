Skimmed milk (United Kingdom), or skim milk (United States of America) is made when all the cream (also called "milkfat") is removed from whole milk.
Sometimes only half the cream is removed, this is called semi skimmed milk.
Skimmed milk is more popular in the United States than Britain.
Skimmed milk contains less fat than whole milk, which means that many nutritionists and doctors recommend it for people who are trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.
