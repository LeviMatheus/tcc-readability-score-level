The Hellbenders and Asian Giant Salamanders (Cryptobranchidae) are aquatic amphibians. They can be found in brooks and ponds in the eastern United States, China and Japan.
Hunting habits.
They hunt mainly at night, and as they have poor eyesight, use sensory nodes on their head and body to detect tiny changes in water pressure, allowing them to find their prey.
Reproduction.
During mating season, these salamanders will travel upstream. After the fertilization of the eggs, the male will guard them for at least six months. At this point, the offspring will live off their noticeable stored fat until it is ready to hunt. Once ready they will hunt as a group rather than individually.
Scientists at Asa Zoo in Japan have recently discovered that the Male Salamander will spawn with more than one female in his den. Sometimes the male "Den Master" will also allow a second male into the den, the reason for this is unclear.
