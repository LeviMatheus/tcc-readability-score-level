Genghis Khan (c. 1155/1162/1167 - August 18, 1227) was a great military leader who unified the Mongol tribes and founded the Mongol Empire. The khans, who came after him, would make Mongolia into the largest empire on earth.
Genghis Khan was the grandfather of Kublai Khan, who was the first emperor of the Yuan Dynasty in China. No one knows exactly where Genghis is buried.
