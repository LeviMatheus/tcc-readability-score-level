Chemistry [kem'-ihs-tree] is the science of "chemical elements" and "compounds", and how these things work together. It is the study of the materials (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us.
Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest substances that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called "elements". For a long time before that, people were trying to study these things to figure out how to do things like turn lead into gold, but no one ever did. This was called alchemy [al-kem-mee].
A chemical "compound" is a substance made up of two or more "elements".
