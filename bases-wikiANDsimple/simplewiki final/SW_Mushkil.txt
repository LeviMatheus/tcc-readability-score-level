Mushkil (Urdu: مشکل, lit. difficult) is an Urdu film which was released on 1995 across theaters in Pakistan. The film dealt with the issue of child-camel jockeys illegally trafficked from the third world into the numerous Arab oildoms. The highlight of the film was the stunning score composed by the late Amjad Bobby. Hit tracks included Dil ho gaya hai tera deewana and Mushkil hai barha mushkil hai.
