Moldovan ("Лимба молдовеняскэ, limba moldovenească") is the official language of the Republic of Moldova. It is the same as the Romanian language. The main difference is that Moldavan is sometimes written in Cyrillic alphabet, because the Moldavian SSR was part of the Soviet Union until 1989. In 1989 Moldova became its own country and they started to use the Latin alphabet just like in Romania. Still, the Moldovan government officially calls the language "Moldovan" and the rules for the language (like grammar) are decided by a different University than in Romania.
In the unrecognized state of Transnistria, one of the official languages is also Moldovan, along with Russian and Ukrainian. But here it is still written with the Cyrillic alphabet.
