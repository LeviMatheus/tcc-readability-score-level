In design planform or plan view is a vertical orthographic projection of an object on a horizontal plane, like a map.
In aviation, a planform is the shape and layout of an airplane's wing. Of all the myriad planforms used, they can typically be grouped into those used for low-speed flight, found on general aviation aircraft, and those used for
high-speed flight, found on many military aircraft and airliners.
