8-1-1 was a telephone number in the United States and Canada. In 2007, it was put together with 6-1-1. In Canada, it is now the number to call for health questions that are not emergencies. 8-1-1 was a direct line to the business office of the telephone company giving service on the line. Once a person has called, they could do different things, such as pay their phone bill, talk to Customer Service, or get another phone line.
