The Raccoon Dog ("Nyctereutes procyonoides") is a member of the canid family and is indigenous to east Asia. Despite being hunted in their thousands, a small island in Japan has been designated a protected area for raccoon dogs.
Physical description.
Raccoon dogs are fox-like in build, but with shorter legs and tail. They have a dark patch on the side of the face, similar to a raccoon's facial markings.
