The Doctrine of Implied repeal is a concept in English constitutional theory which states that an earlier Act of Parliament cannot be used to amend or repeal a later Act. Where conflict arises between two seemingly contradictory statutes it is the later Act which takes precedent. This doctrine is expressed in the Latin phrase "leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant".
