The head of the government of the state of Florida is called the Governor of Florida. He is not the head of all parts of the government, but is like the state's president, and is head of the "executive branch" of the state, which is where decisions about running the state are made. He can also give orders to the military people of the state.
The Governor of Florida is elected every four years.
The United States got Florida from Spain on July 10 1821. No governors were elected until 1845. Before that, there was a military governor for most of 1821, Andrew Jackson, who had been the head of the military men in the area when the state was made.
For the next 24 years (1821-1845) Florida was called a "territory". As a territory, governors were picked by the President of the United States. These were the five governors of Florida Territory: William Duval (April 17 1822 - April 24 1834), John Eaton (April 24 1834 - March 16 1836), Richard Call (March 16 1836 - December 2 1839), Robert R. Reid (December 2 1839 - March 19 1841), Richard Call (his 2nd time) (March 19 1841 - August 11 1844), and John Branch (August 11 1844 - June 25 1845).
