A butterfly is a flying insect. It is closely related to the moth. A butterfly has four wings which are covered with furry scales. When a butterfly is not flying, their wings are usually folded upwards. The wings are patterned and are often brightly coloured. Their are many different types of butterflies, coloured and patterned differently. The males and females of each type are often slightly different from each other. Butterfly watching is a popular hobby. Some people also keep collections of dead butterflies that they have caught.
As with most insects, a butterfly's life begins as an egg. Then it hatches into a larva (caterpillar). After some time, the larva turns into a chrysalis (like a cocoon). While it is in the "chrysalis", it becomes a butterfly. The butterfly then hatches out and lays more eggs. Butterflies have very short life spans that last about a week.
Survival.
Butterflies are in trouble because of habitat loss. Because of the destruction of forests and grasslands, some types of butterflies have nowhere to feed and lay eggs. To help, some people plant a butterfly garden with flowers having lots of nectar for a butterflies to feed on. Some people also keep plants that butterflies lay eggs on, and enjoy watching the caterpillars hatch out and feed on the plant. Chemical sprays that are used to keep pests away from garden plants, also kill betterflies.
Butterflies have many enemies, for example ants, birds, spiders, and frogs.
Jays are very common predators for butterflies. Some butterflies, like the Monarch butterflies (in the pictures below) taste horrible so that birds will not eat them.
