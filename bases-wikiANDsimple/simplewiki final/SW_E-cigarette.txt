An electronic cigarette (or e-cigarette, e-cig) is a cigarette substitute, giving small amounts of the chemical nicotine without tobacco or other chemicals from real cigarettes. The main substances making up in the liquid in the e-cigarettes are nicotine, propylene glycol, gylcerin and some flavors or smells.
Chemistry.
The propylene glycol and the glycerin react and make a vapour which looks like the smoke from real cigarettes. Some people may be allergic to the chemicals in the cigarette.
History.
The original inventor of the electronic cigarette concept was Ruyan and his first patent was registered in 2003. One year later, Ruyanâ€™s first international patent was also registered. The name "Ruyan" translates to "smoke anywhere". Soon, factories in China started making similar devices based on Ruyan's ideas. Many of these creations were soon sponsored by different companies and not only marketed as smoking alternatives but also as an "NRT" (nicotine replacement therapy).
In 2008, this attracted the attention of the World Health Organization ("WHO") who said that these e-cigarettes were not proper nicotine replacement therapy and that this mis-information had to be taken away from any sites or advertisements saying that they were.
