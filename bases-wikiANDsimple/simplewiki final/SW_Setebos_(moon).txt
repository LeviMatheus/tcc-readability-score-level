Setebos is one of the farthest retrograde non-spherical moons of Uranus. It was found on 1999-07-18 by John J. Kavelaars "et al". and designated S/1999 U 1.
Confirmed as Uranus XIX it is named after the god worshipped by Caliban and Sycorax in William Shakespeare's play "The Tempest".
The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Sycorax and Prospero to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin. However, this suggestion does not appear to be supported by the observed colours. The moon appears grey in the visible light, similar to Prospero but different from Sycorax (which is "light red").
