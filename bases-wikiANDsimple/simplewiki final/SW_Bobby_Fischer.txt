Robert James "Bobby" Fischer (March 9 1943 – January 17 2008) was an American-born chess Grandmaster, and the eleventh World Chess Champion.
As a teenager, Fischer became well known because of his skill at chess. In 1972, he became the first and only American to win the World Chess Championship (though Wilhelm Steinitz, the first official world champion, became an American citizen while he was champion) beating champion Boris Spassky, of the Soviet Union, in a match held in Reykjavík, Iceland. The match was known as a Cold War battle. He is often called one of the greatest chess players of all time. After his chess career, Fischer lived in Iceland until his death in 2008.
