Athelstan (c. 895–October 27, 939), called the Glorious, was the King of England from 924 to 939. He was the son of King Edward the Elder. Athelstan's reign is sometimes overlooked but it was of great importance to political developments in the 10th century.
Athelstan was the son of Edward the Elder, and grandson of Alfred the Great. His father succeeded, after some difficulty, to the Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons formed by Alfred. His father had also been the King of Mercia. When Edward died Athelstan quickly became King of Mercia but he was not immediately accepted as King of England. His borther, Ælfweard, had more support in England but died soon after Edward. This made it easier for Athelstan to become king.
For Athelstan it was very important to have many allies. A year after his crowning he married one of his sisters to the viking King of York, Sithric. However, Sihtric died only a year later, and Athelstan took the opportunity to take Northumbria. This move made him king of more territory than any Anglo-Saxon king before him, roughly the same as modern England. Historical records indicate that the other rulers in Great Britain accepted him as king at Bamburgh around this time.
Athelstan died at Gloucester in 939 and was succeeded by his half-brother, Edmund I.
