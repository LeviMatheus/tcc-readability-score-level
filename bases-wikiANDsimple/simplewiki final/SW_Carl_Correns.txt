Carl Erich Correns (September 10, 1864 - February 14, 1933) was a German botanist and geneticist. Tdoay, he is notable primarily for his independent discovery of the principles of heredity, and for his rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's earlier paper on that subject, which he achieved simultaneously but independently of the botanists Erich Tschermak von Seysenegg and Hugo de Vries.
By a quirk of history Correns was a student of Nageli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas, but who failed to understand how significant Mendel's work was. Tschermak was a grandson of a man who taught botany to Mendel, during Mendel's student days in Vienna.
