A play is a piece of writing (literature) which we see at a theatre or on television, or hear on the radio. Plays often show conversations between people, and we usually do not only watch the play, but some people also read plays to understand them better.
The people who we see in a play are actors; in a theatre they stand on a stage so the people watching (the audience) can see them better. A director helps the actors to work better, or tells them how he wants the play to be.
Plays can be very interesting because we can understand them in different ways. When the writer - the playwright - makes the play, he can not say how the actors or director will use it. Sometimes the playwright is also the director or an actor: Moli√®re, for example, was often an actor in his plays. But the director can change the play in different ways: the actors' clothes, the music, how people say things, how they move or what they hold. Modern directors can direct plays by Shakespeare, and these old plays seem modern now, too.
Symbolic can also be called expressionistic. Its all about how the writer or director presents ideas in a very different point of view.
