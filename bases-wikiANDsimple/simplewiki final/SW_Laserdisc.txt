A Laserdisc, like a DVD, can play video of a higher quality than VHS. A Laserdisc is much larger than a DVD. To play Laserdisc movies, a LaserDisc player is needed.
Laserdisc was first produced by MCA in 1978, and became well-known in the 1980s. Movie companies stopped making Laserdisc movies when DVDs became well-known in the late 1990s. Today some of the better Laserdisc players still sell for $1,000 United States or more.
