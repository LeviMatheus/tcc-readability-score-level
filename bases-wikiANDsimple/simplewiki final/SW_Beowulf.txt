Story.
Hrothgar, a Danish king, has built a big mead hall, which is called Heorot. Hrothgar and his people live a good life and celebrate in Heorot. But then they are attacked by Grendel, who comes to Heorot every night and kills some of Hrothgar's people.
Beowulf is a Geatic warrior from Geatland (modern southern Sweden). He hears of Hrothgar's troubles with Grendel. Beowulf and his men leave Geatland to help King Hrothgar.
Beowulf and his men stay the night in Heorot. When Grendel comes to kill them, Beowulf fights him. Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off from his body and sticks it on the wall as a trophy. Grendel runs to his home in the marshes, where he dies. Everyone is happy that Grendel is killed and celebrates.
But the next night, Grendel's mother comes to Heorot and kills many people for revenge and grabs grendels arm. Beowulf then goes to the marshes where Grendel and his mother lived. Beowulf fights Grendel's mother and kills her.
Beowulf goes back home to Geatland, and sometime later becomes a king. Later in his life, he fights a dragon. Beowulf, helped by the young man Wiglaf, can kill the dragon. But Beowulf is wounded in the final battle and dies. After his death, Beowulf is is buried in a barrow in Geatland.
