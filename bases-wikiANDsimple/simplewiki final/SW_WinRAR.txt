WinRAR (a.k.a. RAR) is a shareware file archiver and data compression program created by Eugene Roshal. Many people think that it is one of the three most used File Archiver for Windows, together with WinZip and 7-Zip. It is one of the few programs that can create RAR archives, because the encoding method is proprietary, or it means they own it and nobody else can use it.
