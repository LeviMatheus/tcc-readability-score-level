Asia is the largest continent on Earth, placed in the northern hemisphere. It is connected to Europe in the west. Together, Asia and Europe are called Eurasia.
Asia is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, the Arctic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean. It is separated from Europe by the Caucasus Mountains and the Ural Mountains.
Some of the oldest human civilizations began in Asia, such as Sumer, China, and India. China and India are also the two countries with the most people in the world.
A long, mainly land border in the west separates Europe and Asia. This boundary runs North-South down the Ural Mountains in Russia, along the Ural River to the Caspian Sea, and through the Caucuses Mountains to the Black Sea. About three-quarters of Russia lies in Asia, while the rest is in Europe. Small parts of four other Asian countries are in Europe.
The Asian continent is the largest of all continents. Covering about 3/10 of the world's land area, it has more people than any other continent with about 3/5 of the world's total population. Stretching from the icy Arctic in the north to the hot and steamy equatorial lands in the south, Asia contains huge, empty deserts, as well as some of the world's highest mountains and longest rivers.
