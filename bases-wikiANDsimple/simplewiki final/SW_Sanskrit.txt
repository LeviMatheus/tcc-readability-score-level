Sanskrit is an ancient Indo-Aryan language, and one of the oldest languages of the Indo-European language family. The main script used to write Sanskrit is Devanāgarī.
Now Sanskrit is mainly a religious language but Hindustani and Hindu Pakistanis used to speak it thousands of years ago. Most of the holy books of the Hindu religion are written in Sanskrit, as well as most books of the Buddhist religion ("Mahayana" school).
There are two main types of Sanskrit: Vedic and Classical.
"Vedic Sanskrit" is the oldest Sanskrit, and may have been spoken in Northern India, Pakistan, Kashmir, and Afghanistan by 1500 BC. The main books that are written in Vedic Sanskrit are the Vedas.
"Classical Sanskrit" is newer and more books are written in this style.
Sanskrit was found in the Indus Valley Civilization by the Persians about 5000 B.C. This language is the oldest language in the world and is written in the script "Devanagiri",or the language of the gods.
