The ASUS Eee PC is a very small laptop made by ASUS and Intel. It is designed to have a light weight and low price. It runs Linux as its operating system.
The name "Eee" (pronounced as the letter "e", IPA /iÀê/) comes from "the three Es," ASUS used in their advertisements for the device: "Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play".
