Hurricane Beulah tracked through the Caribbean Sea, struck the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico as a major hurricane, and moved west-northwest into the Gulf of Mexico, briefly gaining Category 5 status. It was the strongest hurricane during the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season. The cyclone then weakened before moving into Texas as a major hurricane. It spawned 115 twisters across Texas, which established a new record for the highest amount of tornadoes produced by a tropical cyclone. Due to its slow movement over Texas, Beulah led to significant flooding, and caused over $1 billion (2005 USD) in damages. There were 58 fatalities.
