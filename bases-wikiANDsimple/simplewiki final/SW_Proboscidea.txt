Proboscidea is an order containing only one familiy of living animals, Elephantidae, the elephants, with three living species (African Forest Elephant, and Asian Elephant).
During the period of the last ice age there were more, now extinct species, including a number of species of the elephant-like mammoths and mastodons.
Origins.
The oldest dates from the early Tertiary period, over 50 million years ago. The evolution of the elephant-like animals mainly concerned the proportions of the cranium and jaw and the shape of the tusks and molar teeth.
