A pen is a tool used for writing or drawing. The word "pen" is from the Latin word "penna". The ink of the pen is pressed onto paper and dries very quickly.
"Quill pens" are one of the oldest type of pens. A quill pen is the feather of a bird, usually a goose. The end of the feather (the quill) was kept very sharp and had to be dipped into ink after every few words.
"Dip pens" are an old type of pen. Like the quill pen, they have to be dipped in ink many times during writing or drawing. The writing end, called the "nib", is made of metal.
"Fountain pens" are like dip pens, but can hold enough ink inside to write several pages before being refilled.
A "ballpoint pen" is usually a cylindrical plastic shaft with a smaller shaft containing ink. It has a very small metal ball on the writing end that rolls the ink onto the paper.
A "stylus" is a pen that cannot write on paper and is usually made out of plastic. They are usually used with touchscreens.
