Professional wrestling (or pro wrestling) is a kind of sport. It is different from other sports because it is a fixed sport. It's actually dubbed Sports entertainment by the Pro wrestling world.
The words 'professional wrestling' mean to wrestle for money, as a job. Many of it participants use it as their life career, like Ric Flair. Wrestling is a sport where two people fight in a match. They try to win by keeping the other down with grabbing or holding or various other moves to hurt an opponent long enough for one person to cover their opponent for about three seconds which is know as a Pin or Pinfall. They can also win by putting an opponet into what is known as a submission to where if the opponent taps out thus says he quits and the wrestler wins. Professional wrestling is not the same as real wrestling (known in the Professional wrestling world as Shoot wrestling). A pro wrestler can try to lift the other and throw him. A pro wrestler can also hit the other with hands and feet, or jump on him. In professional wrestling, the people only look like they are trying to fight. But it is not real. It is a kind of entertainment, so the people watching have fun.

Many people like to watch professional wrestling on television or at the shows. The United States, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are countries that have a lot of professional wrestling.
A company can make money by making professional wrestling shows. The biggest company of professional wrestling is World Wrestling Entertainment, also called WWE. Every year, they have a big wrestling show called WrestleMania.
