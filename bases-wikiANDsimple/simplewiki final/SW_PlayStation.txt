The PlayStation is a video game console made by Sony. At the time it was competeing against the Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn. PlayStation games were released on CD-ROMs. The controllers that were originally released with the console had no analog joysticks on them, but these, along with a vibration feature, were added to later controllers. A slimmer version of the console called the PSOne was released in 2000. This was white, not grey, in colour.
