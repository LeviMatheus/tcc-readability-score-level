Sometimes a river receives a lot of extra water. When this happens, the water overflows from its normal path in the river bed. This is called flooding, and is a natural disaster.
During a flood, people need to move themselves and their most precious valuables to higher ground quickly, if they can. The process of leaving your home behind in search of a safe place is called "evacuation".
Pollution of drinking water.
In a flood, there is plenty of water, but it is mostly polluted and not safe to drink. People can prepare for flooding by filling many containers with fresh clean drinking water.
