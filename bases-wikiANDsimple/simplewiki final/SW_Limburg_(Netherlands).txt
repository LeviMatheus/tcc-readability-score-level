Limburg is the southern most province of Netherlands. Its capital is Maastricht. It is the one and only province in the Netherlands which has hills. It also is a very old province; the capital-city, Maastricht, is over 2000 years old. Also, the Limburgish people don't speak Dutch, but they speak their own dialects. These dialects - especially the ones in the South of Limburg - are famous, because the normal Dutch people can't understand them. These dialects have many influences from German and French.
Limburger cheese comes from this region.
