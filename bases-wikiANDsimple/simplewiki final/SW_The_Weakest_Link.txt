"The Weakest Link" (known as "Weakest Link" in many countries) is a television game show which first appeared in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on 14 August 2000. It was devised by doctor and situation comedy writer Fintan Coyle and the comedian Cathy Dunning, and developed for television by the BBC Entertainment department. It has since been replicated around the world. It may also be called a "reality game show" because of competition similar to present-day reality shows and has been the basis of academic studies. The UK version, hosted by Anne Robinson, reached its 1,000th episode on 18 December 2006.
The show.
In ths show, eight contestants are put in a circle. There are eight levels of money. When the round starts, contestants must answer the questions. If they answer right, the level goes up. If one answers wrong, the level resets to zero. Players may say "bank" to keep the money they have, but this also limits the money they can earn, as each level doubles the amount of money they already have ($100 becomes $200, $200 becomes $400). At the end of each round, players vote off one player.
When it gets down to two players, they are put in a runoff. The host asks each person a question in a row. The first person to answer five questions wins all of the money.
Australian.
In the Australian version, Cornelia Frances hosts the show. There are nine people and $100,000 AU can be won.
American.
There have been two different American versions of the show. The first aired on NBC from April 16, 2001 to July 14, 2002 and was hosted by Anne Robinson. It followed the same format as the British version. The second aired in syndication from January 7, 2002 to May 20, 2003. The host was George Gray and the show was reduced to a half-hour in length. The maximum amount of money was reduced; there are only six players to start; and the first one to three answers in the final round is the winner.
