Mantophasmatodea is a suborder of African carnivorous insects discovered in 2002, originally considered to be a new order, but since relegated to subordinal status, and comprising the single family Mantophasmatidae. The most common vernacular name for this order is gladiators, although they are also called rock crawlers, heelwalkers, mantophasmids, and, coloquially, mantos. Their modern centre of endemism is western South Africa and Namibia, although a relict population and Eocene fossil suggest a wider ancient distribution.
