Buddha Ratnasambhava is one of the five Dhyani Buddhas.
His mandala is yellow and is in the southern direction. Ratnasambhava embodies Dharma that changes pride, miserliness and avarice into equanimity. He is shown with his right hand extended down, palm facing outwards. His left hand holds a precious jewel in his lap. He is associated with changing poverty into wealth. Ratnasambhavaâ€™s blessings allow us to overcome pride and miserliness, thereby developing inner calm. The wealth-giving Buddhas or Jambhalas are associated with the family of Ratnasambhava.
