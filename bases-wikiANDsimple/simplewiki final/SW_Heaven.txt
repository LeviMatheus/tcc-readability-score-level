Heaven is a concept of the afterlife (what happens after you die) in many religions. People who believe in heaven say that it is a place that is perfect (very "very" good and with no problems.) They believe heaven is where people will go after they die if they have been good. Some people also believe in Hell, which is a place where people will go when they die, if they have been bad. They believe hell is a punishment for being bad. Ideas of Heaven and Hell are not the same in all religions.
Heaven meant "sky" when it was first used. So "the heavens" is another way of saying the sky or outer space. This was because early people believed that heaven was a physical place. This place was located in the sky.
Heaven is the place where God lives. It is another word for the spiritual world, because God is pure spirit. Heavenly just means spiritual, so for instance the Kingdom of Heaven is the kingdom of the spirit. However, the people called prophets in the Bible, like Isaiah, often spoke of a physical Kingdom of Heaven that will occupy a new Earth, and ruled by God (Messiah) in the flesh himself, where we will have physical bodies that do not again die. Many people who believe in Heaven today have ideas different from the Bible.
