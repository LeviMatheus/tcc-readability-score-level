A carpet is a rectangular piece of woven textile. Generally, carpets are used to make things more beautiful. They are either put on the floor, or on a wall of a building. In Islam, carpets are also used for people to kneel on when they pray. Carpets are warmer and softer than hard floors such as hardwood, tile, or concrete. Carpets can be many different sizes. Carpets originated in Central Asia.
