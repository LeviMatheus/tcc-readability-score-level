The flag of Puerto Rico consists of five equal horizontal bands of red (top and bottom) alternating with white; a blue isosceles triangle based on the hoist side bears a large, white, five-pointed star in the center.
The flag was created in 1892. In 1952, the flag became the official national flag of Puerto Rico.
