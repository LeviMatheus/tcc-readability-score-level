Speech is when sounds (or gestures) are made in an attempt to communicate. The communication can be "verbal" (based on words), or "non-verbal" (based on actions). Speech can be given to one person, to a few people, or to a large group of people. A speech given by a person to a lot of people is called an address. A person making a speech is called a speaker.
Animals also have speech. They also communicate with each other. However, many times, an animals' communication is not the same as the way we humans speak.
A speaker may say something, but might mean something different. One speech can be understood as many different things, such as in different languages.
