Triceratops (try-SAYR-ah-tops) meaning "three-horned face", because it had three horns (Greek "tri" = three + "keratops" = horned face) was a herbivorous dinosaur genus from the Latest Cretaceous period. It was mainly found in North America. It was about 9 m (30 ft) long, and probably weighed around 5,400 kg (12,000 lb).
