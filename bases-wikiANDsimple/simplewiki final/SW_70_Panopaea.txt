However, it is a dark, primitive carbonaceous C-type asteroid and not related to the parent body of the Eunomia family which has S-type asteroids. Panopaea was found by H. Goldschmidt on May 5, 1861. It was the fourteenth and last asteroid he found. It is named after Panopea, a nymph in Greek mythology.
