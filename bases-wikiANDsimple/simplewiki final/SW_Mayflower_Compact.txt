The Mayflower Compact was the first governing document of Plymouth Colony. It was drafted by the Pilgrims who crossed the Atlantic on the Mayflower (ship), looking for the freedom to practice Christianity according to their own determination. It was signed on 11 November 1620 (OS) by 41 of the ship's more than one hundred passengers, in what is now Provincetown Harbor near Cape Cod.
