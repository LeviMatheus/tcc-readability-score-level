"The Catcher in the Rye" is a novel by author J. D. Salinger. It was first published in 1951.
The book is about a young man, Holden Caulfield, who travels home after being expelled from an exclusive preparatory school. Instead of going directly home, Caulfield takes a wandering trip, thinking about what he wants to tell his family, and how best to deal with being kicked out of school. Caulfield narrates the story himself to a psychoanalyst.
The book contains many profanities, and many people do not like the book for that reason. It was banned in many places. Other people look past the profanities, however, and see them as Caulfield showing his feelings of frustration with life. Many young people, boys in particular, relate to the story and its language, and feel that Caulfield would understand them if he knew them. For this reason, many schools require students to read it.
