Neoprene is the DuPont Performance Elastomers trade name for a family of synthetic rubbers based on polychloroprene (polymer form of Chloroprene). Neoprene was invented by DuPont scientists after Dr. Elmer K. Bolton of DuPont laboratories.
History.
Neoprene (originally called duprene) was the first mass-produced synthetic rubber compound.
Applications.
It is used in a wide variety of environments, such as in wetsuits, laptop sleeves, electrical insulation, and car fan belts. Its chemical inertness makes it well suited for industrial applications such as gaskets, hoses, and corrosion-resistant coatings. It can also be used as a base for adhesives.
Yamaha has begun replacing corks not being used for sealing (such as when sealing the joints of a clarinet) with neoprene.
