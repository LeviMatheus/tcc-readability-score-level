The Boston Red Sox are a baseball team from Boston, Massachusetts and are the World Series Champions in 2007. The Red Sox are a member and are now champions of both the Major League Baseball's American League Eastern Division and of the American League itself. The Red Sox have played at Fenway Park ever since 1912
After the ALCS, the Red Sox beat the St. Louis Cardinals to win their first World Series since 1918 (86 years) in 2004.
One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Boston in 1901. Then known as the Boston Americans, they played at Huntington Avenue Grounds, and met the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series. In 1918, the team won its fifth World Series, and then went into one of the longest championship droughts in baseball history.
Many thought the "Curse of the Bambino" said to have been caused by the trade of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees in 1920. The drought was ended, and the "curse" reversed in 2004, when the team won their sixth World Series Championship.
The Red Sox's current captain is Jason Varitek.
The share a large rivalry with the New York Yankees, and a smaller yet still big rivalry with the Tampa Bay Rays.
