The Geneva Conventions are a set of four treaties of international law. They were formulated in Geneva, Switzerland. All of the four treaties are about humanitarian issues. The Swiss Henri Dunant was the person who started the creation of the conventions. He did this after he saw the unimaginable cruelty of the Battle of Solferino in 1859.
Some parts of the four Geneva Conventions say that all states who signed must create national laws to make violations of the Geneva Conventions a crime.
After the First Convention was agreed, the International Committee of the Red Cross was founded in 1863.
All four conventions were last checked and agreed in 1949. Those versions are related to previous revisions. In some cases, ideas from the 1907 Hague Conventions were added. Usually, people refer to all four conventions as the "Geneva Conventions of 1949" or simply the "Geneva Conventions". Later conferences have added text that forbids certain methods of warfare. They have also spoken about issues of civil wars. Nearly all 200 countries of the world are "signatory" nations, in that they have signed and ratified these conventions.
Clara Barton was important in campaigning for the agreement of the First Geneva Convention by the United States; the U.S. signed in 1882. By the Fourth Geneva Convention some 47 nations had ratified the agreements.
