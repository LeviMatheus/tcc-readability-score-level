Ammonia is a chemical. Its formula is NH3 (not to be confused with "Ammonium" that has a formula of NH4+). It is made from nitrogen and hydrogen atoms.
Ways it can be made.
NOTE: If a goldfish tank is dirty from their waste they can suffer from ammonia burns which cause black spots or patches to come up on their body. Make sure your tank is big enough and it may help if you have a filter.
