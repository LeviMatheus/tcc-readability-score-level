Bisexuality is when people love (sexually and romantically) both men and women. Some people say there is a difference between what people think and feel in this area, and how they actually act (behave).
Some bisexual people love men and women the same. Some love both men and women, but may love one more than the other. A person's sexual orientation is a range from only heterosexual to only homosexual. A person can be mostly heterosexual but have some homosexual feelings. Or a person can be mostly homosexual and have some heterosexual feelings. Some of the people who are somewhere between "only" homosexual and "only" heterosexual are bisexual. Where any person fits in this range is referred to as their sexual orientation.
- Most bisexual people feel they are part of the LGBT "community" (group of people.) But some bisexual people do not feel they belong with lesbian and gay or straight people. Some feel they should have a separate community.
- In biology bisexual can mean an organism that has both male and female organs. This talks mostly about plants. Animals and people who have some male and female characteristics or organs are called hermaphrodites or intersexed.
