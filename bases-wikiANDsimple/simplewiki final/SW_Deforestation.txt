Deforestation is when forests are lost because people want to make farms and cities. Without the forest, the animals habitats are lost and most animals die.
Forests are often planted to protect against natural disasters. When forests are lost, very often the soil they protected is also lost. This loss of soil is often called erosion. We give out carbon dioxide when we breathe and plants and trees take it in by photosnythesis. If we cut down all the trees, then carbon dioxide will float into the atmosphere rather than extracting it environmentally.
