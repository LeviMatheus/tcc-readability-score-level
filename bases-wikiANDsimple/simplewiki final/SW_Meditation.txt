Meditation is to try to get past the "thinking" mind, and into a deeper state of relaxation or awareness.
Meditation is also used in Buddhism, Christianity (sometimes), Hinduism (where Yoga is important)
Buddhist Meditation.
In Buddhism, three things are very important: being a good person, making the mind stronger, and understanding why people are in pain. Meditation is the main way that Buddhists make their minds stronger.
Buddhist meditation is not just used for spiritual reasons. In general, Buddhist meditation can help anyone calm their body and mind. Research shows that Buddhist meditation lowers stress, anxiety and depression.
For Buddhists, meditation is used to calm the mind so that the mind can better see the cause of pain. Buddhists believe that this type of seeing can end pain.
Most types of Buddhist meditation focus on something. The most popular things to focus on include the breath, love, other emotions, and religious images and sounds.
Most Buddhists find that a teacher and support and encouragement from other members of the Buddhist community are important elements of meditation practice. The Buddhist community is also known as the Sangha.
Christian meditation.
Christians sometimes meditate by thinking about small parts of the Bible, or by saying the words of a prayer to themselves over and over.
