A flyover is a trick that people do with planes or helicopters. The Blue Angels are a special group of pilots that do a lot of flyovers at sporting events. Doing a "flyover" usually "flying" "over" the people who are watching. Sometimes the planes fly very low to make the stunt more exciting.
In the military a flyover is when fighter jets fly over the enemy. They do this to try to scare the people they are fighting against.
