Dysphemism means the usage of an harsh word or expression instead of a polite one. It is more or less the opposite of euphemism.
Examples of dysphemism are “dead tree edition” for the paper version of an online magazine, or the American military personnel’s use of “shit on a shingle” for their common breakfast of creamed chipped beef on toast.
Dysphemism is common in everyday language. Sports teams don't actually "slaughter" or "annihilate" one another, and while a losing team may be disappointed or angry, they are unlikely to be "shattered"; few companies actually "crush" their competition; no one is actually "dumb as a box of rocks" (see hyperbole).
