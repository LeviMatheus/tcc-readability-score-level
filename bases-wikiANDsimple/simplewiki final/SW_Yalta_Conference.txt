The Yalta Conference (sometimes called the Crimea Conference) was held in February 1945, just after the Second World War was over. It was when the Prime Minister of Britain (Winston Churchill), the President of the United States (Franklin D. Roosevelt) and the President of the USSR (Joseph Stalin) all met and talked about what to do with Germany. The Yalta Conference was an important part of European History.
