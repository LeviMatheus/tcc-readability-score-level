"If" is an R&B Ballad by Beyonc√© Knowles. The song is her final single from her album '. The song was most likely chosen due to the fact that originally it wasn't available in the U.S. as it was an international track, but due to the Des'ree law suit, the U.S. version of the album with the track "Still In Love (Kissing You)" was replaced by a version with "If". A CD single of the song was created for her official fan club and is available for purchase from their online store.
