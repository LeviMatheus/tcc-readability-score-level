In computer science, an alphabet is a finite set of characters or digits. It is like listing all the letters that can be used to make a word. Each letter is only listed once,
The most common alphabet in computer science is. It is called the binary alphabet. A finite string is a finite sequence of characters from an alphabet. A "binary string" is a string made from the alphabet, for example. An infinite sequence of characters may be constructed from elements of an alphabet as well.
Given an alphabet formula_1, we write formula_2 to denote the set of all finite strings over the alphabet formula_1. Here, the formula_4 denotes the Kleene star operator. We write formula_5 (or occasionally, formula_6 or formula_7) to denote the set of all infinite sequences over the alphabet formula_1.
For example, if we use the binary alphabet, the strings {ε, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000, etc.) would all be in the Kleene closure of the alphabet (where ε represents the empty string)
Alphabets are important in the use of formal languages and automatons. Automatons such as Deterministic Finite Automatons (DFAs) require an alphabet in the formal definition. All states in a DFA must have a transition on every element in an alphabet.
