In Computer Science, a data structure is a method of storing and retrieving data. There are many different types of data structure, some more suited to a specific problem than others. Choosing appropriate data structures to solve a given problem is an important part of algorithm and software design. Different data structures can greatly increase or decrease the performance of a computer program.
