The United Kingdom's National Air Traffic Services (NATS) is a company set up in 2001 to run air traffic control services. This means that NATS makes sure aircraft can fly safely across Britain, and that aircraft can take-off and land safely at British airports.
NATS is a private company, but the government owns 49%, just under half.
Before 2001 the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) handled air traffic control.
