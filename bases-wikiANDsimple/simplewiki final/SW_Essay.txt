An essay is a written text. It is usually about the personal point of view of the author who wrote it. The definition of an essay is vague. articles and a short stories can be quite similar. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been called essays (e.g. Alexander Pope's "An Essay on Criticism" and "An Essay on Man"). People that write essays are called essayists.
Most essays are short. This does not have to be the case. John Locke's "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" and Thomas Malthus's "An Essay on the Principle of Population" are long essays.
