Quoll (genus "Dasyurus") are carnivorous marsupials native to Australia and Papua New Guinea. Adults are between 25 and 75 cm long, with hairy tails about 20-35 cm long about the size of a cat. Quolls once lived in South Australia, but are now extinct (have died out) there. They are found on the island state of Tasmania.
