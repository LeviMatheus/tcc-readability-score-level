The British Rail Class EF1 ("Electric Freight 1") was a class of electrically powered locomotives used by British Rail in England. They were used during the pre-TOPS period. They were also classified as British Rail Class EB1 for a short period of time, although only a single locomotive was completely modified to "EB1" condition.
