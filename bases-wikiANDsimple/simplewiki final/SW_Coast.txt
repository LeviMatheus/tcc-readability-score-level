The coast is where the land meets the sea. It is the land next to the sea, which is also called the shore, or sea-shore. If a house is near to the coast we say it is "on the coast". When we talk about a long part of the coast we call it "the coast-line". In some countries like England or Australia the people sometimes use the word sea-side for the coast.
Coasts often have many living things on it and is a habitat for many animals and plants.
