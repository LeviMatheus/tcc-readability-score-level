Asphyxiation or choking is a condition when you do not have enough oxygen going to your body. If this condition lasts long enough it can lead to unconsciousness, brain damage and death.
Asphyxia is can be used to injure or kill in capital punishment, suicide, torture, and warfare. It is also used non-fatally in martial arts, combat sports. Because the need to breathe is made by the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood, some victims may not experience an urgent need to breathe and may remain unaware of the shortage of oxygen in there body.
