Tikal (or Tikâ€™al, according to the more current orthography) is the largest of the ancient ruined cities of the Maya civilization. It lies in modern day Guatemala at. Now it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a popular tourist spot.
Tikal was one of the major cultural and population centers of the Maya civilization. The oldest monumental architecture at the site dates to the 4th century BC, but the best time of Tikal was during the Classic Period, ca. 200 AD to 900 AD. In this period Tikal dominated the Maya region politically, economically, and militarily, because it was linked with areas throughout Mesoamerica, such as central Mexican center of Teotihuacan. After the end of the Late Classic Period, no new major monuments were built, some palaces were burned and the population declined. The site was abandonment by the end of the 10th century.
Site characteristics.
The ruins lie on lowland rainforest. But Tikal had no water other than what was collected from rainwater and stored in underground storage facilities. Archaeologists working in Tikal during the last century used the ancient underground facilities to store water for their own use. The absence of springs, rivers, and lakes in the immediate neighbourhood is exceptional for a major city. But Tikal prospered with intensive agricultural techniques, which were far more advanced than the slash & burn methods originally theorized by archeologists. The reliance on seasonal rainfall left Tikal vulnerable to prolonged drought, which is now thought to play a major role in the Classic Maya Collapse.
