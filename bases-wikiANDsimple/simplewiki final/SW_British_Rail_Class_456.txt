The British Rail Class 456 electrical multiple units were built by BREL at York Works from 1990-91. 24 two-car units were built as direct replacements for the elderly Class 416 2EPB units which operated on the Central Division of the Southern Region of British Rail. Units were delivered into traffic painted in Network SouthEast blue, red and white livery.
