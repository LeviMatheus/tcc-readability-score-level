In Hinduism, the Goddess Tara (Sanskrit: Tāra, Devanagari: तार) meaning "star" is the second of the ten Mahavidyas or "Great Wisdom(Goddesse)s", Tantric manifestations of Mahadevi, Kali or Parvati. As the star is seen as a beautiful but perpetually self-combusting thing, so Tara is seen at core as the hunger that propels all life.
In the Hindu epic The Ramayana, Tara is the name of Vali's queen. Vali is the monkey king who is killed by Rama, at the behest of his brother Sugriva.
