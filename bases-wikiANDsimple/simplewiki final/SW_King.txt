A king is a male who rules a country because of inheritance. A king usually comes to power when one of his parents dies. For much of history most countries were governed in this way, especially in Europe. In some countries people elected a new king from candidates.
The wife of a king is called a queen. A woman who becomes a monarch because of inheritance is also called a queen.
If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a monarchy. A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom.
See also emperor and prince.
