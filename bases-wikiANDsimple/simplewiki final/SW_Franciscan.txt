The word Franciscan is used to refer to a follower of one of the religious orders that follow the Rule of St Francis. St Francis lived in the 13th century. They usually lead simple lives without much money. Today, there are three main branches of these orders. They mostly see themselves as part of the Roman Catholic or Anglican Church. There are also small communities in the Old Catholic and Protestant Church.
