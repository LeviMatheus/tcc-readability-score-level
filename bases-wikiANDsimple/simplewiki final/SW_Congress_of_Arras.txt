The Congress of Arras was a political collection of people created in Arras in 1435 between England, France, and Burgundy.
The Treaty of Arras (1435) was an important diplomatic win for France late in the Hundred Years' War. Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy made peace with Charles VII of France. This hurt England because Philip the Good had helped them for 16 years.
