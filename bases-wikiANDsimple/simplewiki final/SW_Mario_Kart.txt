"Mario Kart" is a series of racing video games made by Nintendo. It features Mario and his friends driving race carts. The first game was called "Super Mario Kart" and was made for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System video game console in 1993.
Gameplay.
Eight racers gather on a circuit and race for three or five laps until one kart finishes first. Along the way, players can pick up items to use against rivals. Some items help the player and others hurt the other players. For instance, a lightning bolt will make all the other racers smaller and slow them down, allowing the player who used it to speed ahead. A mushroom will give a big speed boost to the player who uses it.
All games after "Super Mario Kart" feature another mode called battle mode. In this mode, all racers are given a number of balloons and they race around a track. If they get hit by an item, they lose one balloon, and when they lose all of them they lose the game. The last player with any balloons is the winner.
Each game features two different racing modes. Players can either go right into whichever track of their choosing or they can play GP. In GP, players race on four or five tracks in a row and win a championship depending on how they place. They receive points for how they placed in the race.
Online.
The two latest games, "Mario Kart DS" and "Mario Kart Wii", use the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. In "DS", players could only race on tracks. In "Wii", people can go into battle mode.
