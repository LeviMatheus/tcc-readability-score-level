Luís Vaz de Camões (c. 1524 – June 10, 1580) was Portugal's greatest poet. He has been compared to Homer, Virgil, and Dante. He wrote lyrical poetry (in Portuguese and in Spanish) and drama but is best remembered for his epic work "Os Lusíadas". (His philosophical work "The Parnasum of Luís Vaz" was lost, stolen with part of "Os Lusíadas" by envious enemies while he was staying at Mozambique.)
