A sickle is a curved tool used in agriculture for harvesting grain crops. It was the tool used before machines were used for harvesting. It has a curved blade with an attached handle. The inside part of the blade is sharp, so that the user can swing the blade against the crop's base, catching it in the curve and slicing it.
In Greek mythology, the Greek deities Cronus and Perseus used the sickle as a weapon.
