Lake Erie is one of the Great Lakes in North America. It is the second lake up from the mouth. Like Lake Superior, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario, Lake Erie is part of the boundary between the USA and Canada.
Most of the water that flows into Lake Erie flows through a large river, the Detroit River, that moves down from Lake Huron past Detroit, Michigan. Some more water flows into Lake Erie from other rivers, including the Maumee and the Cuyahoga. At the mouth of the Maumee is Toledo, Ohio. At the mouth of the Cuyahoga is Cleveland, Ohio.
Water that flows out of Lake Erie flows past Buffalo, New York, and into the Niagara River. On its way down to Lake Ontario, the Niagara River pours over Niagara Falls, one of the largest waterfalls in North America, and then into the lowest of all the Great Lakes, Lake Ontario.
