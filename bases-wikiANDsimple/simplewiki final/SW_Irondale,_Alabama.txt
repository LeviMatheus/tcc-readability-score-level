Irondale is a city in Jefferson County, Alabama, United States and a suburb of Birmingham. At the 2000 census the population was 9,813. The book (later a film) "Fried Green Tomatoes", by Irondale native Fannie Flagg, is loosely based around the town and the landmark Irondale Cafe, known as The WhistleStop Cafe in the book & film.
