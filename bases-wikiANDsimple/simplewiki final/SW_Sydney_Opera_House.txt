History.
The land on which the Opera House now stands (Benolong Point) was once home to Fort Macquarie, (built in 1817 and knocked down in 1901). On the 10th August 1902 the Fort Macquarie tram depot was opened. It was knocked down in 1958. The Sydney Opera House was built on the same spot and the work began in 1959.
