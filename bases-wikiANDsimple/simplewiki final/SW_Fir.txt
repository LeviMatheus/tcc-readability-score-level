Firs ("Abies") are about 45-55 species of evergreen trees in the family "Pinaceae". All are trees, reaching heights of 10-80 m tall and trunk diameters of 0.5-4 m when mature. The difference between firs and other members of the pine family is that their needle-like leaves are attached to the twig by a base that resembles a small suction cup, and by erect, cylindrical cones 5-25 cm long that release the winged seeds.
