Alexander Hamilton (born January 11, year unknown - probably 1755 or 1757â€“died July 12, 1804) was the United States' first Secretary of the Treasury, and was known for the creation of a national bank.
Early Life.
Hamilton was not born in the United States. He was from the Carribean island of Nevis. His father was named James Hamilton and his mother was named Rachel Fawcett Lavien. Hamilton's mother had a child from a previous marriage that she left behind when she moved to Nevis. At the time, this meant that Hamilton was illegitimate since his mother and father were not legally married. He was very sensitive about this fact.
Education.
Hamilton graduated from Columbia University, which was known then as Kings College. He wanted to go to Princeton but wasn't accepted.
Legacy.
Hamilton is shown on the face of the U.S. Ten dollar bill. He is one of only two non-Presidents (the other is Benjamin Franklin) honored on commonly used notes.
