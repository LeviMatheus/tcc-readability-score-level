The gustatory system is the sensory system for the sense of taste.
Function.
The human body can be stimulated by certain things. This stimuli is measured by sensory receptors and the energy is converted to something our brain can understand. There are receptors in our tongue which can measure four main things.
Salt.
This is the simplest receptor found in the mouth.
Sour.
Sour tastes are usually received from acidic compounds.
Bitter.
Bitter tastes are important, since poisons are usually bitter and therefore we need to know whether or not to spit a bitter food out. This is the most complicated receptor found in the mouth.
Sweet.
Food which has a lot of carbohydrates such as glucose are sweet.
