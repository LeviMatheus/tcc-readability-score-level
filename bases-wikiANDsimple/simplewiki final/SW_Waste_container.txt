A waste container (known more commonly in British English as a dustbin, rubbish-bin or simply bin, and American English as a trash can) is a container, usually made of plastic or metal, used to store refuse.
Rubbish (trash) is usually kept in these until it is emptied by collecters, who will take it to a landfill or incinerator.
Some bins are used specifically for recycling.
