The Saltwater crocodile ("Crocodylus porosus") is the largest of all living reptiles. It is found in suitable habitat throughout Southeast Asia, Northern Australia, and the surrounding waters.
Description.
The Saltwater crocodile is now a protected species in Australia, however if human danger is a factor, the crocodile will be moved away from possible contact. Many years ago Australia used to export crocodile skin, this is now illegal.
Reproduction.
They reproduce in the wet season, with the female crocodile laying up to 60 eggs at a time. When the crocodiles are born, only a very small number of these survive in the wild and grow to be adult crocodiles.
