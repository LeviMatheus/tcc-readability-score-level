Lung cancer is the malignant change and growth of lung tissue, and is the most deadly form of cancer worldwide. Three million people die from it each year. Although lung cancer was once an illness that affected males much more than it did women, the incidence in women has been increasing in the last few decades, which has been blamed on the rising ratio of female to male smokers. Currently, lung cancer is the leading causing of cancer death in women, killing more women than breast cancer, ovarian cancer and uterine cancers together. However, there are certain types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked.
