Moulin Rouge (Translates from French to English as "Red Windmill") is a traditional cabaret and nightclub which began in 1889. It is situated near to the French quarter of Montmartre in the red-light district of Paris called Pigalle on Boulevard de Clichy in the 18th "arrondissement". It can be recognized by the large red windmill it has on its roof.
The Moulin Rouge is where the famous French dance, the Can-can was first performed. It is also famous because many artists and writers have often gone there. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec designed many posters for the cabaret. Because of this, the management set aside a table where he could have a meal and watch the show every night.
Several movies have been made about the Moulin Rouge. The latest is "Moulin Rouge!" directed by Baz Luhrmann.
