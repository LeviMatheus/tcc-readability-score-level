Warship was an extremely popular British television drama series produced by the BBC between 1973 and 1977.
The series was about life on board a Royal Navy warship, the fictional HMS Hero. It was mainly filmed aboard the Leander-class frigate HMS Phoebe.
Four Leander class frigates played the role of HMS Hero. They were HMS Phoebe, HMS Dido, HMS Hermione and HMS Jupiter. All the crews of these warships were given HMS Hero cap tallies for filming purposes.
The opening music of the series was a march played by the Royal Marines, called "Warship", and written by Anthony Isaac. It is still played by Royal Marine bands.
