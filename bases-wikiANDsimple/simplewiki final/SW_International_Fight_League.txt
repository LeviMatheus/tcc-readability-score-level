The International Fight League is an American mixed martial arts (MMA) league and is the world's first MMA league. Instead of the established norm for MMA events, where matchups are strictly one-on-one affairs, each IFL card is a showdown between two teams of five fighters, each fighter fighting one match against another on the opposing team. The IFL is shown in the United States on Fox Sports Net and MyNetworkTV.
