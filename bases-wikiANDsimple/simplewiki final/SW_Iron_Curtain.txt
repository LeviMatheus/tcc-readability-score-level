The Iron Curtain is a word related to the Cold War. It means the border between the states that were members of the Warsaw pact (in Eastern Europe), and those that were not (then called "The West").
This border was between East Germany and West Germany, between Czechoslovakia and Austria, and between Hungary and Austria.
