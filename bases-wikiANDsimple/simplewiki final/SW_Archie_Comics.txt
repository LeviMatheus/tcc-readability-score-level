Archie lives in a small town named the "Riverdale". The state, or the general location of this town is not to be known.It is known, however, that John L. Goldwater went to school at Horace Mann, which is located in New York City in a part of the Bronx called Riverdale. In the early years of Archie, Riverdale was located in Massachusetts, with Mr. Lodge being a senator for that state, but this is no longer considered canon.
