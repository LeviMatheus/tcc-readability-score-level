Lycopodiopsida is a class of plants often loosely grouped as the fern allies, and includes the clubmosses.
Lycopodiopsida traditionally included all the clubmosses, including "Selaginella" and "Isoetes". But now subdivisions within the Division Lycopodiophyta are made.
Clubmosses are thought to be structurally similar to the earliest vascular plants, with small, scale-like leaves, homosporous spores borne in sporangia at the bases of the leaves, branching stems (usually dichotomous), and generally simple form.
A powder known simply as "lycopodium", consisting of dried spores of the common clubmoss, was used in Victorian theater to produce flame-effects. A blown cloud of spores burned rapidly and brightly, but with little heat. It was considered safe by the standards of the time.
