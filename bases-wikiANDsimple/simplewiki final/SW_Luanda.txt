Luanda is the capital and the largest city of Angola. Its former name was Loanda. It is a main seaport of the country located on the Atlantic Ocean. About 3 million (1995) people are living in there.
It is a center of manufacturing, but very destroyed because of a long civil war.
It was found by Portuguese in 1575 as São Paulo de Luanda and has been the administrative center of Angola since 1627 (except for 1640–1648). When Angola got independence in 1975, it became the capital of Angola.
