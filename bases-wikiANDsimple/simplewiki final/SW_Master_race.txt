The Master Race was an idea used by Adolf Hitler and others.
History.
This idea mostly began in the 19th century. It is not a theory accepted by most scientists today. It claims there is a hierarchy of races (or that some races are better than others). It was also claimed that at the bottom of the hierarchy were black-skinned people from Africa and Aborigines from Australia, while pale-skinned people with blonde hair and blue eyes from the north of Europe were at the top of the hierarchy.
Writers who began this idea.
Arthur de Gobineau believed that cultures become worse when races mix. Arthur Schopenhauer agreed with this idea. He said that the White race had become what it was though refinement and harsh conditions in the North. Others who liked the theory were Guido von List, Lanz von Liebefels and Houston Steward Chamberlain.
"Aryans", Hitler's "Master race".
Hitler and his followers, the Nazi party, took power in Germany in 1933. The Nazis made laws that were based on their ideas of race. They claimed that "Aryans" were the "master race", called Aryanization. They also made propaganda that blamed Jews for many things. German Jews were forbidden to own property, and were attacked and killed. When Germany invaded other countries in Europe, they also started putting people into concentration camps.
During the Second World War, about eleven million people were killed in these camps. This was called the holocaust.
