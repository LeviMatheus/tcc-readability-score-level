The Toba catastrophe theory is a scientific theory that the volcano Toba (on Sumatra) erupted. The eruption happened between 75.000 and 70.000 years ago. According to the theory, the average temperature dropped between 3-3.5 degrees Kelvin. This caused most of the humans living at that time to die. According to the theory, only 10.000 (perhaps only 1.000) pairs of humans survived the disaster. Perhaps it led to the other hominids becoming extinct. After this, the Earth was colonised again, starting from Africa.
