A period, also known as a full stop, in punctuation is a dot (.) that is at the end of a sentence. It shows that an idea has finished.
means that Elizabeth paid one dollar and twenty-five cents for her drink.
A period also means a word has been shortened when it's after the word, for example: "Pty. Ltd." The words doctor, mister, and mistress are often made shorter when used with a name. "Dr." Smith" is the name of a doctor whose last name is Smith, and "Mr." Banerjee" and "Mrs." Yang" are common ways of writing "Mister Banerjee" and "Mistress Yang". It is also used for names when the first and middle name are shortened but the last name isn't, for example "J." Citizen".
When three periods are used together (...), they are called an ellipsis.
