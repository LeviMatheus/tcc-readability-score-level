There are thick forests in the south, and these are home to rare gorillas. This part of Africa also has Pygmies.

The people mostly grow their own food, but sometimes droughts (long spells without any rain) make this difficult. C.A.R. also has diamond and uranium mines. It sells these, as well as cotton, coffee and timber to other countries to make money.
