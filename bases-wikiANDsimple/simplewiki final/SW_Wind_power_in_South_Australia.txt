Wind power in South Australia is a growing industry with 388 megawatts (MW) of grid-connected wind farms, and a further 341 MW under construction. South Australia is well suited to wind farms and more wind power is generated in South Australia than any other Australian state or territory. Some 9 per cent of electricity generated in South Australia comes from wind power.
Wind farms do not emit greenhouse gases in the generation of electricity, and so wind power is considered a highly desirable form of renewable energy which assists in the reduction of the Stateâ€™s reliance on coal and gas fired electricity generation.
