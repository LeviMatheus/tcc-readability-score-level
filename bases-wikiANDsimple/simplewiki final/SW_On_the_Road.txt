"On the Road" is a novel by American writer Jack Kerouac, written in April 1951, and published by Viking Press in 1957. Most of it is autobiographical and was written based on the spontaneous road trips of Kerouac and his friends across mid-century America and is often considered a defining work of the postwar Beat Generation.
When the book was originally released, the "New York Times" hailed it as "the most beautifully executed, the clearest and most important utterance" of Kerouac's generation. The novel was chosen by "TIME" Magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.
