Logic is the science of reasoning. Logic helps people decide whether something is true or false.
formula_1 is read like "and", meaning both of the two.
formula_2 is read like "or", meaning at least one of the two.
formula_3 is read like "implies", or "If... then...".
formula_4 is read like "not", or "it is not the case that...".
Finally, those talking about "logic" talk about "logic clauses". A clause is simply something like "Aristole is human" or "all humans are mortal".
Clauses have a truth value; they are either true or false, but not both. Mistakes in logic are called "fallacies".
There are statements that are always true.
formula_7 is always true. It is called a "tautology". (for example: "It rains, or it does not rain")
Logic is used by computers in what is called an algorithm. An "algorithm" is sort of like a cooking recipe; it tells the computer what to do and when to do it.
Logic is used in mathematics. People who study math create proofs that use logic to show that math facts are correct. There is an area of mathematics called mathematical logic that studies logic using mathematics.
Logic is also studied in philosophy.
