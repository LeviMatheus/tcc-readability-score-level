Nokturnal Mortum is a pagan black metal band from Ukraine. It is one of the major black metal bands from eastern Europe, along with Graveland.
History.
The story began in Kharkiv on the December, 31, 1991 with the birth of the band SUPPURATION (unholy death metal) with main members being Knjaz Varggoth, Munruthel and Xaarquath. Their first release was "Ecclesiastical Blasphemy" in 1992, and was distributed by Shiver Records in Belgium. After Sataroth joined the band in 1992 as vocalist they recorded the "Unspeakable Journey Into Subsconscious World" demo (1993).
In April 1993 Wortherax (guitar) joined the band and the following month they recorded "Cosmic Flight Around Astralspher". The demo was supposed to be out as 7" EP on The Final Holocaust Records (Russia), but the label collapsed and Suppuration died in the summer of the same year.
Still, as of Autumn 1993 there was a new band CRYSTALINE DARKNESS (black metal) in place. Line-up included Knjaz Varggoth - vocals / guitar, Karpath - guitar and Munruthel - drums. Having recorded the "Mi Agama Khaz Mifisto" demo the band negotiated with View Beyond Records (Czechia).
Then in 1994 former Suppuration members got together and recorded the "Twilightfall" demo (1995) under the name of NOCTURNAL MORTUM (with "C" in the first word). As the band then went into black metal the name suffered change to NOKTURNAL MORTUM (now with "K").
In the end of 1995 - early 1996 the legendary "Lunar Poetry" demo was created and recorded. The MC was released in Spring 1996 by MetalAgen Records (Russia). Shortly after release Wortherax left the band and was replaced by Karpath and Saturious, as a second keyboard player. In the summer 1996 the second album "Goat Horns" was recorded (released in Spring 1997 by MetalAgen on MC).
In December 1996, "Return Of The Vampire Lord" was recorded. It included a brand new title song and two songs of Crystaline Darkness ("Mi Agama Khaz Mifisto" and "Crystaline Darkness"). This EP was released in 1997 by MetalAgen Records as a split MC with LUCIFUGUM "Path Of Wolf", but then NOKTURNAL MORTUM canceled their relations with that label due to MetalAgen wrong policy.
In 1996 NOKTURNAL MORTUM with LUCIFUGUM also recorded a joint album entitled "Vetche" - MC was released in 1998 by Oriana Production.
In 1997 NOKTURNAL MORTUM have recorded "To The Gates Of Blasphemous Fire" album and "Marble Moon" EP that included an Ukrainian folk song "Swallow" and Hymn Of Ukraine. At the same time the band signed with The End Records (USA) that offered very good conditions and agreed to release all NOKTURNAL MORTUM albums on CDs. So the first release was "Goat Horns" released on the March, 31, 1998. The new album "To The Gates Of Blasphemous Fire" was released on the March, 1, 1999 by The End/ Nuclear Blast (which licensed NOKTURNAL MORTUM for Europe with the first European release being "Goat Horns"). Meanwhile, "Goat Horns" and "To The Gates Of Blasphemous Fire" were released in the end of 1998 in MC format by Oriana - "Goat Horns" with new cover art.
In January 1999 the band have fired their lead guitarist Karpath. February, 26 - May, 9 NOKTURNAL MORTUM were recording their new album entitled "Nechrist" (with Russian and English lyrics). In Autumn 1999 Oriana Production is releasing "Nechrist" and "Lunar Poetry" in MC format.
In Spring 2000 Munruthel and Saturious had left NOKTURNAL MORTUM. "Nechrist" CD was released on the July, 4, 2000 by The End/Last Episode. Istukan and afterwards Khaoth had joined NOKTURNAL MORTUM as session drummers, but in the autumn Munruthel has returned to NOKTURNAL MORTUM. Also, Vrolok (a member of RUNES OF DIANCEHT) had joined the band as a new guitarist. In the end of 2000 Saturious has returned to NOKTURNAL MORTUM.
In the beginning of 2001 Oriana Production is releasing "Return Of The Vampire Lord / Marble Moon" MC...
After recording of “Nechrist” the activity of NOKTURNAL MORTUM was stopped. During this time NOKTURNAL MORTUM members worked with their own projects: MISTIGO VARGGOTH DARKESTRA - Knjaz Varggoth, MUNRUTHEL (old name - SILENTIUM) - Munruthel and FINIST - Saturious and Munruthel. Also Knjaz Varggoth, Munruthel and Saturious are members of the Polish band PIORUN.
In this period NOKTURNAL MORTUM recorded three songs: “Thurisaz” (cover of GRAVELAND), which is not released till now, “ Journey to the Stars” of BURZUM (released in the tribute album Visions–A Tribute to Burzum in 2003) and “Iron Eagle Towards the Golden Svarga” which was included in "The Taste of Victory" album.
During Winter - Summer of 2002 NOKTURNAL MORTUM recommenced their concert activities. K. had joined to them as a second keyboardist but not more than a half-year. Also Xaarquath had left the band. And from that time Vrolok works in band as bass guitarist.
And at last after many years of delays and promises is finally putting the finishing touches to NOKTURNAL MORTUM’s long awaited brand new material. For this session violinist and new guitarist Alzeth was accepted.
The forth release is the compilation, dedicated to the 11th anniversary of band's activity (incl. proto-NOKTURNAL MORTUM bands such as SUPPORATION and CRYSTALLINE DARKNESS) “Eleven Years among the sheep”, which was in 2004.
In December,2003 NOKTURNAL MORTUM had fired Munruthel and Odalv had joined the band as a new drummer.
During 2004 NOKTURNAL MORTUM’s discography was enriched. Oriana Music has released “The Taste of Victory” CD, “Return of the Vampire Lord” CD and “Twilightfall” CD. Also “Nechrist” CD, “To the Gates of Blasphemous Fire” CD, “Goat Horns” CD and “Lunar Poetry” CD was re-released.
The first NOKTURNAL MORTUM’s LP (double LP) “Nechrist” was released by Ledo Takas. 3 gatefold LPs (“Lunar Poetry”, “To the gates of Blasphemous Fire” and “Goat Horns”) was released with No Colours supporting.
In 2005 new album was out in two versions. English version was released by German No Colours under the name “Weltanschauung” and Ukrainian–by Oriana Music under the name “Mirovozzrenie” (this is Russian translation of “Weltanschauung”).
Now Nokturnal Mortum is finishing the work with new album “The Voice of Steel”.
