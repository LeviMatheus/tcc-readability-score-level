Africa is the second largest continent in the world. It makes up just over a fifth of the world's land. It is surrounded by large areas of water. There are 61 countries in Africa, and 14% of the world's population live there. It is thought to be the continent where the first humans came from.
North or Saharan Africa.
Much of North Africa is dry and warm, as it is dominated by the Sahara Desert and does not receive a monsoon season. In Saharan Africa there are few rivers or other water sources for the people. The reason it is so warm and dry is because the continent is very wide - this means it is far away from the ocean, which brings rain and wind. Underground water sources, such as springs are very important in the desert. These often form oases. An oasis is an area of vegetation (plant life) surrounded by desert.
Countries that are in the North, but are not part of the Sahara desert, are still affected by the very dry wind from the desert.
These are very warm areas of the earth, and at the centre of the tropics is the equator (represented by the red line on the right). These lines do not really exist, they are used by people to show where the sun's rays are most powerful.
In the extreme north, the climate is cooler and similar to the climate of European Mediterranean countries.
Animals.
Africa has a lot of wildlife. There are many types of animals there. Some are cheetahs, elephants, lions, snakes, giraffes, and a lot more. Over 2,000 types of fish live in African lakes and rivers.
