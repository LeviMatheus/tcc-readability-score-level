The Himalayan Wolf is a kind of wolf that was thought to belong to the Tibetan Wolf family, but it, in fact, may be its own species, "Canis himalayensis".
It is usually found in a small part of northern Republic of India, in Himachal Pradesh state and also in Indian occupied Kashmir and, also in the eastern part of Nepal in the Himalayas. The habitat of the Himalayan Wolf (also known as the Tibeten Wolf) is only in small parts of Pakistan and Kashmir, the Republic of India, and into China and Mongolia.
