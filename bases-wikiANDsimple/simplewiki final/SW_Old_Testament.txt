The Old Testament is considered a holy book for both Jews and Christians. They believe God inspired men to write it. It is made up of many different books, and is about God, and the people of Israel. It is mainly called the "Old Testament" by Christians, who also believe God inspired men to write the New Testament. Jews usually call it the Tanakh. It can be divided into several sections; the Torah, the History of Israel, the Prophets and the books of Wisdom.
The first to have used this name (in Latin: "vetus testamentum") was probably Tertullian in the 2nd century. Different religious communities include (or exclude) certain books. The Eastern Orthodox church uses the name Septuagint to refer to it. It also has some additions to the Roman Catholic versions. Protestant Bibles often leave out certain parts (of the original Tanakh)
