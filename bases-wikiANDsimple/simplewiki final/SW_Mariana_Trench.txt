The Mariana Trench (or Marianas Trench'") is the deepest known submarine trench. It is also the deepest known location on Earth itself. It is located next to the Mariana Islands, and has a depth of roughly 11km. The trench is near Guam.
The deepest part of the trench, known as the Challenger Deep, has a depth of 10,923 meters (35,838 feet).
The Challenger Deep has been reached twice by submersibles, namely the Bathyscaphe "Trieste" on 23 January 1960 and the Japanese "Kaiko", an unmanned robotic deep-sea probe on 24 March 1995.
"Kaiko" was lost as sea in 2003, and to date there is no surviving probe or submersible strong enough to withstand the immense pressures of the Challenger Deep.
A Trench is a deep underwater canyon.
