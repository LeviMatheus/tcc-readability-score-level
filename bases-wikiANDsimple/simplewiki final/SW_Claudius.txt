Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (August 1, 10 BC â€“ October 13, 54) (called Claudius for short) was the fourth Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. He ruled from January 24, 41 to his death in 54.
Claudius had trouble speaking and walked badly. His family did not like him and would not give him a job. He wrote history books for most of his life. After his nephew, the ruler Caligula, was killed in 41, Claudius became emperor, or ruler of Rome. He was the last living person in his family.
Claudius built water works, bridges, and roads. He added Britain to the Roman empire. He ran a census, where he counted everyone who lived in the empire. He married Agrippina and adopted her son, Nero. Agrippina killed Claudius with bad mushrooms. Nero became the 5th Roman emperor.
