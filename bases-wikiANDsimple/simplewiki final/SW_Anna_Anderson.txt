Anna Anderson said she was Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. She had the same physical appearance as her, including some very unique scars and a screwed up finger on her left hand. While some claim that she was burned to death in a huge bonfire with her younger brother Alexi, she said she was saved by a Bolshevik soldier after Anastasia's family was killed on July 17,1918 during the Russian Revolution. She tried to kill herself in 1920 in Berlin, Germany. She was taken to a mental hospital. She told her story to people there. Some people believed her. Some people did not. It was a mystery for 70 years. Movies were made about her story. She married Jack Manahan and called herself Anastasia Manahan. They lived in Charlottesville, Virginia. Anna Anderson died in 1984.
