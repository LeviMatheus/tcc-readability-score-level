The Royal Academy of Music is a conservatory in London where young people can study music. It was founded in 1822. Many musicians who became famous studied music at the Royal Academy of Music.
The Royal Academy of Music was officially founded (started) in 1822 and was opened the next year. King George IV was the patron of the conservatory. At first it had 21 students.
In 1830 it received its Royal Charter, but for many years it had financial problems and it was not until 1868, when the British Prime Minister Gladstone arranged for it to have a regular grant, that it began to do well. During the 19th century the RAM was in Hanover Square, but in 1912 it moved to St Marylebone Road near Regent’s Park.
Since 1912 many changes and extensions have been made to the building. Many concerts are given in the Duke’s Hall and operas are performed in the Sir Jack Lyons Theatre. Many of the professors (teachers) at the Academy come from other countries. They often get together to decide how the Academy should be run. The Academy works together with King’s College, London where many of the students take a 4 year performance course. In 1997 they won some lottery money which helped them to get a new building for their collection of musical instruments. It has a large library which includes all the books and music which used to belong to the conductors Sir Henry Wood and Otto Klemperer.
Today the students come from over 50 countries. Students from abroad can attend a special “English for Musicians” course. There are over 600 students at the Academy. The students have many opportunities to perform, both in the Academy and in concerts in other places. For example, on 31 August 2007 an orchestra of students from the Academy performed at the service of thanksgiving for the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. Over 90% of the students find a career in music after they leave the Academy.
The principal of the Royal Academy of Music is Sir Curtis Price.
