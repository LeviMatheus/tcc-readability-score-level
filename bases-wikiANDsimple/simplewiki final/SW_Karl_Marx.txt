Karl Heinrich Marx (May 5, 1818 â€“ March 14, 1883) was a German philosopher and political thinker who wrote about money (economics) and power (politics). Marx thought that in an economy run on wage-labor, there would always be class struggle. His most famous book was the "Communist Manifesto". He wrote it with Friedrich Engels in 1848. The book sets out the ideas and aims of communism. His ideas are called Marxism.
His most important work is "Das Kapital". He spent many years working on the three volumes of the book. Das Kapital talks about and disagrees with "capitalism". The book has led to many debates between those who agree with the book and those who do not. This is mainly because those who believed in the ideas of the book started many socialist revolutions (like the Russian Revolution) to change many countries. The system in those countries were communist, and many of their governments killed those who disagreed with them, or put them in prison.
Marx's most popular theory was his "Materialism". He believed that religion, morality, social structures and other things are all rooted in economics.
Karl Marx was born in Germany in 1818, but had to move many times because people did not like his ideas.
Marx lived for a long time in London. He died there in 1883. After he died, his friend Engels finished many of his works.
Marx also wrote <O"onomisch-philosophische Manuskripte aus dem Jahre 1844> in his early days.
