Wikiversity is a free wiki website, a sister project of Wikipedia, and run by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is made to help students in learning. A Wikiversity provides a lot of learning materials in every subject. It has many links to other wikis like Wikipedia and Wikibooks. There are currently wikiversities in nine different languages: Czech, English, French, German, Greek, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish.
Wikiversity is the newest Wikimedia Foundation project so far, and it started in 2006. Before that. Wikiversity was a part of Wikibooks, the library of free textbooks.
Wikiversity contains many types of things that help people to learn, but it is quite small, and most of its learning materials are made only halfway. Most of the information is from Wikipedia or Wikibooks.
