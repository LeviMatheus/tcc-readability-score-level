The 1972 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XI Olympic Winter Games, were celebrated in 1972 in Sapporo, Japan. It was the first Winter Olympics to be held outside Western Europe and the United States, and only the 3rd Games (Summer or Winter) held outside these regions, after Tokyo and Mexico City. The city won the rights to the games in 1966.
