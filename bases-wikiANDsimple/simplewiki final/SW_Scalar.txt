Scalars are simple numbers.They are used for measuring things. Many things can be measured, and the measure can be explained by only giving the number.
Suppose we are measuring a rod. We could give the measured length as 2 metres or 3 cm etc. depending on the length of the rod under observation. Here only the figure 2 or 3 along with the unit of measure is enough to transmit information about the rod.
i.e. mass is measured by scalars, distances are measured by scalars.
The other family of measurement falls under the category of vectors.
