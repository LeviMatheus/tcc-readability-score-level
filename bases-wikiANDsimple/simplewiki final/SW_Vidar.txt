Vidar is a god in Norse mythology. He is the son of Odin and the giantess Grid. He is the god of the forest, of revenge and of silence. In Ragnar√∂k, his father, Odin, will be killed by Fenrir. Vidar will take revenge, by killing Fenrir. He will either do this by stepping on his jaw and tearing the wolf apart, or by driving a sword through the heart of the wolf.
