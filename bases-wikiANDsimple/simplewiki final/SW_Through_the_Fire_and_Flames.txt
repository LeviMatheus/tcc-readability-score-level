The track was used in the first music video by DragonForce. The video used the shorter version of the song. I was only 4 minutes and 59 seconds in length. The video shows the band playing on a dark stage.
During the guitar solos, the camera was often on Herman Li and Sam Totman, with an inset shot of whoever is currently playing. During Herman Li's solos, Sam Totman stands around drinking. At the start of the solo, a Pac-Man sound is played by Herman. After this, the whammy bar that was used to make this sound is thrown in the air. Pictures of all sides of the band members are shown. At the very end, the camera moves quickly away from the band.
