Huntington's disease is a genetic disease that can be passed on from parent to child. It affects parts of the brain and causes people who suffer from it to have increasingly jerky movements and problems in behaviour as it progresses. It is found in about 7 of 100,000 people. It is named after George Huntington who described it accurately in 1872.
