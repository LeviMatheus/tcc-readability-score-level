A word is something spoken by the mouth, that can be pronounced. It is also a collection of letters used together to try to communicate a meaning, and these can also usually be pronounced. Some words can be only one letter, for example "a" and "I" in English. Besides English, every other language also has its own words.
For example, "hello" is a word.
