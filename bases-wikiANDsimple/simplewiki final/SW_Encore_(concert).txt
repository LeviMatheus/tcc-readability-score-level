An encore at a concert is an extra piece that is played at the end of the concert. It is not on the programme, although the performer may have secretly planned it. A performer will play an encore if the audience claps a lot at the end of the concert. Sometimes the audience shout "encore!" when they want an encore. The word "encore" is the French word for "again".
An encore is usually a short piece. Often it is a fast piece to finish the concert off happily, but if the performer(s) has just played a very energetic, loud piece an encore might be a quiet piece. A concert given by a solo performer or small group of performers is more likely to finish with an encore than a concert with an orchestra, but a lot depends on the tradition from one country to another.
Although "encore" is a French word, in France the audience shout "bis!"
