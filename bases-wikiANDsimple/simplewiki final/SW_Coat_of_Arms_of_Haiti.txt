The first coat of arms of Haiti was created in 1807, and has appeared in its current form since 19816.
It has a palm, with several flags at its sides, and two cannons on a green lawn. On the lawn there are several objects, such as musical instruments (a snare drum and bugles), guns, and ship anchors. Above the palm tree, there is a Phrygian cap placed as a symbol of freedom.
The ribbon on the bottom displays the national motto: "L'Union Fait La Force" (French for "Union Makes Strength").
