The Great Lakes are five very big lakes in eastern North America. They are, in fact, the biggest fresh water lakes in the world (freshwater is water that is not salty like the ocean).
Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between Canada and the United States of America. The other, Lake Michigan, is entirely inside the United States.
Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron; then through the Detroit River into Lake Erie; then through Niagara Falls into Lake Ontario; and then through the Saint Lawrence River to the Atlantic Ocean.
