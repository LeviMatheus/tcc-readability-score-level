A chinrest is a part on a violin. It helps to hold the violin against the player's shoulder. A chinrest is usually made of wood. It is usually not glued on. Instead, metal clasps are used. These clasps are put against the side of the violin. They are held on by the tension of the screws in them. Older violins do not often have chinrests.
