A blood vessel is a tube that carries blood. Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood to the heart are veins. Capillaries go between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood and oxygen.
The heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system
