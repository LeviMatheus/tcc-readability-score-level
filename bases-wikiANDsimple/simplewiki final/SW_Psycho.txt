"Psycho" is a 1960 horror film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. It is mostly noted for the killing of a main character early in the movie. Hitchcock also did something like that in "Vertigo". The film is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, which was in turn inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein.
The film depicts the encounter between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary who is in hiding at a motel after embezzling from her employer, and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the motel's lonely owner. It initially received mixed reviews but outstanding box-office returns, prompting a re-review which was overwhelmingly positive and led to four Academy Award nominations.
It's most famous line is "A boy's best friend is his mother." said by Norman Bates. In 2005, it ranked 56 on AFI's list of the one hundred most popular quotes of all time. In 1997, it was the 18th most popular movie on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.
