The Potsdam Conference was a meeting of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States in Potsdam, Germany from July 17 to August 2, 1945. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (Clement Attlee), the President of the United States (Harry S. Truman) and the leader of the USSR (Josif Stalin), all met to talk about Germany on July 1945 and were going to discuss what should happen to it now that the Second World War was over.
The first conference was held at Yalta, but the allies didn't agree on anything very important. However, a lot had happened since the Yalta Conference. Firstly, the USA had a new president called Harry Truman. He was much tougher on Communism than the old president, Roosevelt, had been. This was a problem for Stalin. Also Churchill had been voted out and was replaced by Attlee, Stalin saw himself as far more experienced than these new leaders. Stalin also caused trouble, as some of what the allies agreed on at Yalta was that Poland should have a neutral government. Stalin had killed the neutral government leaders and replaced them with ones that he liked better. This meant that there was a lot of problems at Potsdam.
