Menopause means the natural and permanent stopping of menstruation. Female hormone levels drop, since they were produced by the ovaries which have now stopped working.
Cause.
The menopause starts when the ovaries stop releasing eggs every month. This can occur during old age or because the eggs have had surgery.
Adaption.
Due to the change in hormone levels, women get hot flushes and palpitations, depression, anxiety, irritability, mood swings and lack of concentration.
