The Hugo Award is an award given each year for the best science fiction or fantasy works of the previous year. The award is named after Hugo Gernsback, the founder of the science fiction magazine "Amazing Stories". Hugo Awards have been given out every year since 1953, except 1954. Hugo Award winners are chosen by members of the Worldcon convention each year. The ceremony where the awards are given out is a main part of the convention.
The Hugo Award trophy was co-designed by Benedict Jablonski.
The 2006 Hugo Awards ceremony was held at the 64th World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) on Saturday, August 26 in Anaheim, California. The 2007 Awards were presented at the 65th World Science Fiction Convention in Yokohama, Japan on 1 September.
