Reproduce is to create or recreate something. The two types of reproduction are sexual and asexual. Sexual reproduction involves two animals of the same species, each giving half of the genes for the descendant. Asexual reproduction only needs one animal or cell, this works by division (or splitting) of the cell. Most bacteria reproduce by asexual reproduction.
