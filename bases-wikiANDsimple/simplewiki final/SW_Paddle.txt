A paddle is a tool used for pushing against liquids, either as a form of propulsion in a boat or for mixing liquids.
Materials and designs.
Paddles commonly used in canoes consist of a wooden, fibreglass or metal rod (the "shaft") with a handle on one end and a rigid sheet (the "blade") on the other end. Paddles for use in kayaks are longer, with a blade on each end, and usually no handles.
