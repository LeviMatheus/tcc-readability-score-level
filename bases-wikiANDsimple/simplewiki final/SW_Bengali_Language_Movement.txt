The Bengali Language Movement (also called the Language Movement) were protests by people living in Bangladesh, which was part of Pakistan during that time. The people living in Bangledesh started protesting because they did not like that the government of Pakistan made Urdu the official language, which they did not speak. The government responded to the protests by making meetings outside illegal. At the height of the movement, police killed students that were protesting. The Shaheed Minar was a monument built to honor these students.
Bengali did become an official language on 29 February 1956. This day is celebrated by Bangladesh as Language Movement Day.
