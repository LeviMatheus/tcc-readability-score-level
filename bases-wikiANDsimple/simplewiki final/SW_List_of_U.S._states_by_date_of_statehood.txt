This is a list of U.S. states by date of statehood. It has the date when each U.S. state joined the Union. The first 13 states became states of the United States on the date of the Declaration of Independence, Thursday, July 4, 1776 but they are shown here as "joining" on the date each ratified the United States Constitution. The dates on this list do not deal with the time during the American Civil War when several states left the United States and later rejoined.
