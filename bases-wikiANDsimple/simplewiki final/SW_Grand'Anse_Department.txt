Grand'Anse is one of the ten departments (French: "départments", singular "départment") of Haiti. It used to be part of the Sud Department.
The department was split in 2003, with the creation of a new department of Nippes from the Miragoâne and l'Anse-à-Veau "arrondissements".
Before the split, it had an area of 3,310 km² and a population of 733,200 (2002). Its capital is Jérémie. It is bordered to the south by the Sud Department, to the east by the Nippes Department, to the west by the Jamaica Channel (Caribbean Sea) and to the north by the Gulf of Gonâve.
