Rape is having sexual intercourse with a person who does not want to, or is unable to give their consent. The person who rapes is called the rapist. The rapist may use force, threats of violence, or drugs. Rape is a form of sexual assault. In most countries, rape (and other sexual assaults) is a crime punished harshly.
Medical emergency information.
According to the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) in the United States, rape is a medical emergency. When a person is raped, it is important for them to get medical help quickly. Rape can cause dangerous injuries and diseases. There is also more evidence to help find the rapist if the person gets help very quickly. Many people say that people who are raped should see a doctor before they clean themselves, so they can get medical help more quickly and save the evidence. They should also tell the police.
Rape can cause physical injuries like bleeding in the vagina or rectum. There may be bleeding inside the body. Doctors can give a woman emergency contraception so she does not become pregnant because of the rape. Medicines can help prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Many emergency medical technicians, emergency room nurses, and doctors are trained to help people who have been raped. Some hospitals have "rape kits" that are used to save evidence after a rape.
Some people who are raped take medicine to prevent HIV. This medicine can help if the person starts taking it less than two days after the rape. Taking medicine to prevent HIV is not always necessary, because the chance of getting HIV is very small (between 0.1 and 0.3 percent). Taking medicine to stop HIV makes the chance even smaller, but some people who take the medicine still get HIV. Also, the medicines used to stop HIV make some people feel sick. These medicines are good for some people, but not everyone.
