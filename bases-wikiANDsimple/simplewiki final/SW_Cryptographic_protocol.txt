A cryptographic protocol (also known as encryption protocol or security protocol) is an abstract or an existing protocol that performs a security-related function and applies cryptographic methods.
A protocol describes how the cryptographic algorithms should be used to secure information. The description of a protocol must includes details about all data structures and representations, and all details about how to utilize the protocol by programs.
The term "cryptographic protocol" is used in different ways. For example, cryptographic "application" protocols often use one or more underlying Key-agreement protocols which are also sometimes themselves referred to as "cryptographic protocols", like the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which uses what is known as the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, Diffie-Hellman may be seen as a complete "cryptographic protocol" in itself for other applications.
