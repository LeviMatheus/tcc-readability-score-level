Acuminite is a mineral that is colorless in color and is made from crystals. It is named for the Latin word "acuminis" (meaning "sharp point" or "spearhead") for the way the crystals are made. It is easily found in Greenland in the Ivigtut cryolite deposit. It is easily scratched with a copper penny.
