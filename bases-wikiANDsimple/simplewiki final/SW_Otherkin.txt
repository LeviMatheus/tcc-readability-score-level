Otherkin are people who believe that part of them is not human inside. They say that, inside their heads, they feel more like another animal than a human. That other animal might be real, like a wolf, or it might be fictional, like a dragon or an alien. Some otherkin say that they are vampires, by which they mean that they need to drink blood or take the energy away from people in order to stay healthy.
Otherkin is a neologism—a new word—and it is usually used only by people who say they "are" otherkin. The definition can change depending on who uses the word. Some otherkin say that their souls or minds are not human, that they were another species in a past life, or that being not-human is part of their religion. (Otherkin practice many different religions, however.) A few of them say that their physical bodies are not human, either, but there is no proof either for or against that.
