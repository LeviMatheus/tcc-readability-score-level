546 Herodias is a C-type asteroid orbiting in the Main belt near the Eunomia family. However, it is not a family member but an unrelated asteroid in the area because what it's made of is inconsistent with membership. Its diameter is about 66 km, its albedo around 0.053, and its rotation period is 10.4 hours.
It was found by Paul GÃ¶tz in 1904. Its provisional name was 1904 PA.
