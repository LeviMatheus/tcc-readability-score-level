International style.
There are ten international style ballroom dances, five "standard" (or "modern") and five "Latin:"
Most of these are British kinds of dances that started in other places.
Most people do these dances for fun. Some people compete against each other. Women wear nice dresses (gowns) for standard competition and very short skirts for Latin. Men wear white shirts and bow-ties for standard and black t-shirts for Latin.
People compete at many levels: Newcomer, Pre-Bronze, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Pre-Championship, and Championship. The best-known competition is in Blackpool, England.
Some people earn medals to show how they are improving. They dance in front of a judge to earn a medal at the Bronze, Silver, or Gold levels.
There are also some line dances, in which people dance as a group instead of with a partner. Some line dances are done to Mambo, Waltz, Paso Doble, and Samba.
Some people dance in couples, but also as a group, with everyone doing the same steps. This is called "formation dancing."
