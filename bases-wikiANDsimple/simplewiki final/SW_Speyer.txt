Speyer (English formerly "Spires") is a city in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate with about 50.000 inhabitants on the Rhine river. It lies south of Ludwigshafen and Mannheim. Around the year 500 the town gets the name "Spira", named after the stream "Speyerbach" which flows into the Rhine river here.
The center of Speyer is dominated by the cathedral. Here are the tombs of several of the Salian emperors: the bodies, however, are believed to have gone missing during one of the French invasions during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.
