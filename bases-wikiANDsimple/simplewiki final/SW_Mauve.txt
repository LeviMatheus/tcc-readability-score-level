Mauve (pronounce to rhyme with "Jove" and "stove") is a light greyish purple colour. It is similar to lavender and lilac. The name comes from French form of "malva" meaning "mallow".

Meaning of mauve.
Mauve became very popular in the 1890s. This decade was sometimes referred to as the Georgian "Mauve Decade", because William Henry Perkin's aniline dye allowed the widespread use of that colour in fashion.
The colour became associated with homosexuality because well known figures in the art world during the 1890s were gay such as author Oscar Wilde and artist Aubrey Beardsley.
