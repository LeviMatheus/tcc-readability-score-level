The Lake District, also known as The Lakes or Lakeland, is a rural area in north west England. It is a popular vacation area, famous for its lakes and its mountains and it associations with the early 19th century poetry and writings of William Wordsworth and the Lake Poets.
Lake District National Park is one of the fourteen National parks in the United Kingdom. It lies entirely within Cumbria, and is one of England's few mountainous regions. All the land in England higher than three thousand feet above sea level lies within the Park.
The Lake District is about 34 miles (55 km) across (north-to-south or west-to-east).
Lakes.
Only one lake in the National Park has the word 'Lake' in its name, namely Bassenthwaite Lake. All the others such as Windermere, Coniston Water, Ullswater and Buttermere use other forms, with 'mere' being particularly common. The major lakes and reservoirs in the park are given below.
The word 'tarn' is a local word used to describe any small lake that may otherwise be called a pond.
