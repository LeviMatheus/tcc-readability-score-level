The Indus Valley Civilization (3000â€“1500 BC) was an ancient civilization located in modern Pakistan. This civilization developed along the Indus River and the Ghaggar-Hakra River. These rivers were very important rivers of Ancient Pakistan. Now, these places and rivers are still in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Indus Valley Civilization covered a large area - from Balochistan (Pakistan) to Gujarat (Republic of India). Today some old remains of the Indus Valley Civilization can be found in Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and Iran. The first city to be discovered by excavation (digging up) was Harappa and therefore this civilization is known as Harappan Civilization.
