History.
Brothels have been known for most of recorded history. At first there was temple prostitution in many Mediterranean and Middle Eastern countries.
In Ancient Greece and Roman civilizations, brothels were established. Sometimes they were licensed institutions. This was first recorded in Athens in 594 BC. Public sources of the time said it was good that Solon installed the brothel. People said this would reduce the problems caused by sexually unfulfilled sailors and workers. It would also fill money into the public purse. This first official brothel was soon followed by many others, and also influenced the creation of special schools in which various classes of prostitutes (from slavegirls to future courtesans) were trained for their profession.
Business models.
The third option (the brothel owner renting space and facilities to prostitutes) gives some way for the brothel owner to say he did not know what is going on. This is especially the case where prostitution is forbidden or restricted. Brothel owner often disguise their actions as running a massage parlor, a bar or a similar venue.
Allowing such places (while forbidding prostitution) can also give politicians a way to save their face when they do not want to put the laws against prostitution into practice.
