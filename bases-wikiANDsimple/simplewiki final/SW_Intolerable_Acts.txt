The Intolerable Acts or the Coercive Acts were names given by the American colonists to a number of laws passed by the British Parliament in 1774.
The British Parliament passed these laws to punish the Massachusetts colony for the Boston Tea Party. One of the laws closed Boston Harbor until the colonists paid for the destroyed tea. Another law banned the committees of correspondence. Still another law allowed Britain to house troops where ever it wanted to. The Laws were so harsh that the colonist called them the Intolerable Acts.
Other colonies offered Massachusetts their support. They sent supplies to Boston. The committees of correspondence also called for a meeting of all colonies. This meeting would decide what to do about the problems with Britain.
