"MTV Unplugged" is an acoustic live album by Canadian musician Bryan Adams. The album was recorded in September, 1997 at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City. Adams was joined by Irish piper Davy Spillane and Michael Kamen who wrote orchestrations for many of the songs and brought students from the Juilliard School to play them.
The album includes only thirteen of the songs recorded at the show. Many more are included on the MTV Unplugged DVD and the song order is also different than the CD.
