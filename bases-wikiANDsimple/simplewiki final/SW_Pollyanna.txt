Pollyanna is a book for children written by Eleanor Hodgman Porter. It was published in 1913.
Story.
A girl called Pollyanna is an orphan (her parents are dead). She goes to live with her Aunt Polly (who did not marry) in Beldingsville, Vermont. Pollyanna is happy all the time, and makes other people happy. She plays a game called the "glad game", where you find something to be happy about even when you are sad. Soon, everyone in the village is happy. But then Pollyanna is hit by a car and she is sad because she cannot walk. She has to learn to be happy again, and then she gets better because a doctor makes her well again. Aunt Polly and the doctor marry.
Notes.
If someone is called "Pollyanna", it means they are always happy like Pollyanna is. The "Pollyanna principle" means people say yes to positive statements (For example, instead of "What do you think of green?", you can say "Don't you agree that green is a nice colour?").
