Sabato "Simon" Rodia (1879-1965) was an Italian immigrant who lived in the United States in the district of Los Angeles, California called Watts. Starting in 1921 and until 1954, he built the Watts towers, from junk and things he found. Many people made fun of him and tried to vandalize (damage) the "towers". He did not like people making fun of him, in 1955 he moved away from Watts and never returned. The "towers" remained, and the site where he built them is now a national landmark.
