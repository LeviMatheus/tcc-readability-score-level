Duane Eddy (born April 26, 1938) was Grammy Award-winning American rock guitarist. Many people enjoyed his music and tried to play the same way as he did. He is best known for the music that he played without singing words. Few years after his Rebel Rouser hit, he was one of the first rock artists to sell whole albums instead of only single songs.
