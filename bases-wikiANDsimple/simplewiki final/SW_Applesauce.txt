Applesauce (or apple sauce) is a sauce that is made from stewed and mashed apples. Peeled or unpeeled apples can be used and different spices or additives like cinnamon can be used. Sugar or high fructose corn syrup is sometimes added to the applesauce to sweeten it. Applesauce can be fine or coarse textured, and can include large pieces of apple. It is easy to make at home, and it is also sold already made in supermarkets as a common food or as a snack for children and people that have dentures or other problems with their teeth. Parents often feed it to their babies because teeth are not needed to eat it. It is sometimes recommended to fight diarrhoea, since it is high in dietary fibre.
In the United Kingdom, apple sauce is normally used as a sauce that is often used on ham, pork, and gammon.
