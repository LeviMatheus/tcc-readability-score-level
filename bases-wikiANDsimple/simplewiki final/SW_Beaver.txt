A beaver is a kind of rodent. It is "semi-aquatic", meaning some of the time it lives in water, some of the time it lives on land. Beavers can only be found in North America and Europe. In Europe, they almost became extinct (died off), but they are returning. There are beavers living in the Elbe and Rhone rivers, as well as in Bavaria, Poland and Scandinavia.
Beavers are known for building and keeping dams in rivers.
Kinds of beavers.
Currently there are two different species of beaver, the American beaver (C. canadensis) and the European beaver (C. fiber).

The European beaver.
The European beaver is currently an endangered species. It was hunted almost to extinction. This was done because of its fur, and because of castoreum. Castoreum is made by a certain gland, which is also responsible for the smell of the animal.. People are currently (2007) reintroducing the beaver, because the important role of the beaver for the ecology of rivers was discovered. Beaver dams (or the small lakes that form) provide a habitat for many species.
