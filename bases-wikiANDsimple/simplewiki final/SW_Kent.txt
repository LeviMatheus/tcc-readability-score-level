Kent is a county in England. It is just below London to the south-east of the city and is on the coast. The sea next to Kent is called The English Channel by the British. France is opposite Kent on the other side of The Channel. At the most narrow point, between Dover, Calais and Cape Gris-Nez, The Channel is only 21 miles (34 km) wide. Dover is one of the main ports in Kent. From here many ferries sail to and from France.
The other main port in Kent is Folkestone. Many people travel from here to Calais in France by train using The Channel Tunnel (built in the late 1980s and early 1990s). Kent is often called 'the garden of England' because its countryside is very green. Maidstone is called the county town because the local government for Kent is based there.
Kent is a very ancient county and another of its important towns is Canterbury. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the head of The Church of England. Hundreds of years ago many Christian people would travel to Cathedral at Canterbury from their homes in other parts of Britain. This was called making a pilgrimage. A lot of fruit such as strawberries are grown in Kent, and the county is famous for growing hops which are used to make beer. There is also a respected university in Canterbury.
