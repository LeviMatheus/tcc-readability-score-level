Confucianism is the philosophy based on the teachings of Confucius (511 BC - 479 BC), who was an important Chinese philosopher. Confucianism has a complex system of moral, social, political, and religious thought, and has had a large influence on the history of Chinese civilization.
Confucianism was made to stop the fall of Chinese society. After the Zhou Dynasty fell, people cared only for themselves and didn't have any respect for others. Confucianism became a social order for China, teaching that social relationships are the most important. People slowly started to believe in it, because they wanted to have peace, but they had to care for themselves too. As a result, Confucianism brought the people love, harmony, and respect for one another.
Confucianism was started in Ch'u-fu, Confucious's birthplace. Today, Confucianism is spread all the way around the world, but is still more pronounced in China.
