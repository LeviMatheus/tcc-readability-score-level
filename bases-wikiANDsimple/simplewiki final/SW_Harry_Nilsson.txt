Harry Edward Nilsson III (1941-1994) was an American singer and songwriter, whose biggest hits were during the late 1960s, and the 1970s. His songs included "Me And My Arrow", "Coconut", "Cuddly Toy", "Spaceman", and "One", which was also a hit for Three Dog Night. Nilsson's two most famous records were "Without You" and "Everybody's Talkin'", which were written by other people (Peter Ham and Tom Evans of Badfinger; Fred Neil). "Without You" has been re-recorded many times by other singers, and "Everybody's Talkin'" was used in the 1969 movie "Midnight Cowboy".
Nilsson recorded a tribute to The Beatles on his first album, working lines from fifteen of their songs into a single cover version of "You Can't Do That". Derek Taylor, who worked for the Beatles, sent them copies of the album, and Nilsson became a friend of the band. He later shared a house with John Lennon and Ringo Starr, and they worked together on each other's music.
Nilsson also wrote a cartoon movie, "The Point!", which appeared on ABC. It was about tolerance and diversity. "The Point!" was later turned into a musical. One production of the musical starred former Monkees Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones. (The Monkees had recorded two of Nilsson's songs, "Cuddly Toy" and "Daddy's Song", after they met him through producer Chip Douglas.)
The movie "You've Got Mail" features several of Nilsson's songs in its soundtrack.
