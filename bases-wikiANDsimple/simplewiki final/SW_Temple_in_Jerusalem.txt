The Temple in Jerusalem or Holy Temple (Hebrew: בית המקדש, transliterated "Bet HaMikdash" what means literally "The Holy House") lied on the Temple Mount (Har HaBayit) in the old city of Jerusalem. According to classical Jewish belief, it was the "footstool" of God's presence in the physical world.
The First Temple was built by king Solomon in seven years during the 10th century BCE and has been dated astronomically to 957 BCE. It was the center of ancient Judaism. This first Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE. A new temple was build from 535 BCE to 516 BCE. That was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE. All of the outer walls still stand, although the Temple itself has long since been destroyed.
The Islamic Dome of the Rock, has stood on the site of the Temple since the late 7th Century CE, and the al-Aqsa Mosque, from roughly the same period, also stands on the Temple courtyard.
