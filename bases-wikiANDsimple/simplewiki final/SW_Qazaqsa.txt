Qazaqsa is the name given to the language of Kazakhstan written in latin alphabet.
History.
The language of Kazakshtan in central Asia has been written in cyrillic alphabet since Russia started to occupy that country in the XIX century.
After WWI in the Turkish countries started a linguistic change to use only the Latin alphabet, promoted mainly by Kemal Ataturk of Turkey. Consequently, from 1927 to 1939 in Kazakhstan - that was part of the Soviet Union - was used the Latin alphabet. But Stalin reinstated in 1940 the Cyrillic in order to impose a russification of soviet central Asia.
In 1991 the newly independent Kazakshtan started to allow the return to the old Latin alphabet, but with the use of the Cyrillic as the primary alphabet.
In 2006 the actual president Nazarbajev of Kazakhstan has implemented a project to substitute in 15 years the Cyrillic with the latin alphabet of the "Qazaqsa", in order to officially use the "Qazaqsa" as the only language of his country after 2020.
