The Dallas Stars finished first in regular season play, and won the Stanley Cup Championship over the Buffalo Sabres in a disputed fashion on a disputed overtime goal by Brett Hull. Goaltenders continued to rule the league, as only two teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the New Jersey Devils, averaged more than three goals scored per game.
