History.
Jazz started in the United States in the early 20th century. Jazz music has musical influences from the African slaves who were taken from Africa to work in the plantations of the southern United States, such as "call and response" songs and blue notes. As well, Jazz music has musical styles from European music.
To remember the different periods in jazz, we divide into decades and their main directions. In the 1920s, there was New Orleans-style Jazz and Dixieland jazz. In the 1930s, there was swing jazz, which was also called big band jazz. In the 1940s, there was Bebop jazz. Large jazz bands, which are called big bands, were also popular in the 1940s. Big bands usually have 5 saxophone players, 4 or 5 trumpet players, 4 trombone players, a piano player or guitar player, an acoustic bass player, a drummer, and sometimes a singer. In the 1950s, there was hard bop jazz. In the 1960s, there was modern jazz and free jazz. In the 1970s, there was jazz fusion, which blended jazz music with rock music. Nowadays, there are many styles at the same time, like Nu-Jazz, electro-jazz and impro-jazz!
