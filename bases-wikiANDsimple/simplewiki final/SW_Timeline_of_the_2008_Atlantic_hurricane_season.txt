Below is a timeline of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, documenting all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, and will last until November 30, although the first storm of the season, Tropical Storm Arthur, developed before the official start, on May 30. For convenience and clarity, in the timeline below, all landfalls are bolded. The timeline will also include information that was not operationally released, including post-storm reviews from the National Hurricane Center, when it becomes available.
The graphical bar above gives a brief overview of storm activity during the season, and for convenience, the storm's maximum intensity is included as a color bar.
