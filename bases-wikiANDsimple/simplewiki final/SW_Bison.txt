Bisons are a group of even-toed ungulate mammals. They form the genus "Bison" of the subfamily Bovinae and the family Bovidae.
Habitat.
Bison live in the northern part of the world. The American Bison lives in North America, and the Wisent lives in Europe.
Life.
They live to be about 20 years old and are born without their "hump" or horns, which both males and females have. After shedding their light colored hair, and with their horns, they are grown at 2 to 3 years of age, but the males keep growing slowly until about age seven. Adult bulls are very dominant in mating season.
