In 1845, German physicist Gustav kirchhoff first described two laws.
In electromagnetics field these laws are action to generalization of ohm's law.
This Kirchhoff's circuit law is very useful solving in circuit problem.
kirchhoff's current law, also known as Kirchhoff's first law and Kirchhoff's junction law.
This law states that 'The sum of current into a junction equals the sum of current out of the joining'.
This Kirchhoff's junction law is same.
In junction an electric charge's sum preservation law is applied.
If the first of the current's value is i2 and i3 these divides two of current i1 and i4. Then this equation(i1 + i4 = i2 + i3) satisfies.
This Kirchhoff's first law is that the electron is not disappear or created in junction point.
This is based by an electric charge preservation law.
Kirchhoff's voltage law, also known as Kirchhoff's second law, a closed circuit law and Kirchhoff's loop law.
The algebraic sum of the voltage (potential) differences in any loop must equal zero.(This circuit is a closed circuit)
Because any complex circuit is divided in many closed circuit.
This mean that in the circuit there are an electric cell and electric resistance.
So the electric cell give to electron the electromotive force, and then in the electric resistance this electromotive force is disappear by it.
But in electric resistance if our direction is opposit with current's direction, this electric resistance is help to electromotive force.
This Kirchhoff's second law is based by energy preservation law.
