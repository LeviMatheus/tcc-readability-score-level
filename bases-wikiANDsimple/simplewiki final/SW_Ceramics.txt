Ceramics is the name for materials that are formed by the use of heat. The name comes from the Greek word "κεραμικός" ("keramos"). The word is for non-metallic, inorganic materials. The most important of these materials until very recently were different kinds of clay. Through heat, these can be made into bricks or pottery. Today, ceramics exist that are not based on clay, but on other materials.
Works of art are sometimes also made of ceramics.
