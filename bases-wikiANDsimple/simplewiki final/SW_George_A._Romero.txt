George Andrew Romero (born February 4, 1940) is an American director, writer, editor and actor. He is known for his horror movies with zombie themes.
Life and work.
Romero was born in New York City to a Cuban-American father and a Lithuanian-American mother.
Romero went to Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University. After graduating in 1960, he started directing short films and commercials before moving onto horror films. He and friends started a directing group called "Image Ten Productions" in the 1960s, and they made "Night of the Living Dead" (1968). The movie was directed by Romero and written with John A. Russo. It became a cult classic.
Later, Romero made "There's Always Vanilla" (1971), "Season of the Witch" (1972) and "The Crazies" (1973) and "Martin" (1977). These films were not as popular as "Night of the Living Dead".
In 1978, Romero made another zombie film called "Dawn of the Dead" (1978). The film made over $55 million and was named one of the top cult films by "Entertainment Weekly" in 2003. Romero made a third zombie film called "Day of the Dead" (1985), which was less popular.
In the 1980s and 1990s, Romero made other films such as "Monkey Shines" (1988) (about a killer helper monkey), "Two Evil Eyes" (1990), "The Dark Half" (1993) and "Bruiser" (2000) (about a man whose face becomes a blank mask).
In 1998, Romero made a commercial for Resident Evil 2.
Universal Studios made a remake of "Dawn of the Dead" in 2004, without Romero.
Romero is separated from his wife, Christine Forrest. They have two children together.
Favourite films.
Romero chose his favourite top ten films of all time as: "The Brothers Karamazov", "Casablanca", "Dr. Strangelove", "High Noon", "King Solomon's Mines" (1950), "North by Northwest", "The Quiet Man", "Repulsion", "Touch of Evil" and "The Tales of Hoffman". "The Tales of Hoffman" is Romero's "favourite film of all time; the movie that made me want to make movies."
