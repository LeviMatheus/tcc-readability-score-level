A tuxedo is an ensemble (or outfit) of clothing which includes a dress shirt, a bow tie, dress pants, a tuxedo suit jacket, dress socks, leather dress shoes, and sometimes a vest. Many men wear this outfit in Western countries on formal occasions like a marriage ceremony or a fancy party.
The dress shirt is usually made of cotton or linen. A dress shirt has a stiff collar and it is ironed before it is worn. A bow tie is usually made of silk or polyester, and it is usually black. Dress pants are made of wool or polyester, and they are ironed before they are worn. A tuxedo suit jacket is usually made of wool or polyester. Suit jackets have a collar, pockets, and a silk or polyester lining. Dress socks are made of cotton or a mix of cotton and polyester. Dress socks are usually in a dark color such as black or dark blue. Leather dress shoes are usually made of dark-colored leather which is polished. Sometimes, people wearing a tuxedo will also wear a sleeveless vest with buttons in the front.
Some men wear a tuxedo for their jobs, such as symphony orchestra musicians or waiters in expensive restaurants.
