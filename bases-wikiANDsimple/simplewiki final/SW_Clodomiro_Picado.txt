Clodomiro Picado Twight (April 17, 1887 - May 16, 1944) was a Nicaraguan born Costa Rican scientist. Picado is believed by many to have been the first scientist to have learned about penicillin. He published more than 115 studies about biological sciences.
Early life and education.
Picado was born in San Marcos, Nicaragua but moved, with his parents, to Costa Rica in 1890. In 1908, Picado won a scholarship of the Costa Rican Congress to study in Paris, France.
In 1913, he finished his university studies in La Sorbonne, where he earned his bachelor´s degree in zoology and botany, as well as a doctorate degree. In the same year, he came back to Costa Rica to run the laboratory of San Juan de Dios Hospital. At the same time, he was teaching Natural Sciences at San Luis Gónzaga School in Cartago city.
Discoveries.
Sir Alexander Fleming, a Scottish scientist, is commonly said to be the person who learned about the antibacterial attacks of a fungus known as "Penicillium notatum" in 1928. But in March 2000, Costa Rican doctors showed some notebooks with research belonging to Doctor Picado. In these notebooks, he explained his experiments between 1915 and 1927. These experiments had been developed to explain that Penicillium decreased bacterial activity.
Doctor Picado had reported his work to the Paris Academy of Sciences in France, but this Academy did not patent it, even though doctor Picado had studied the fungus years before Doctor Fleming.
Picado developed his greatest international study about the creation of various anti-venom serums. This led to the create of the Instituto Clodomiro Picado in 1970. It is is a research unit of the University of Costa Rica The unit is works on research dealing with Toxicology, Herpetology and Immunology. It also deals with the production of anti-venom. It was named for him in honor of his life’s work.
