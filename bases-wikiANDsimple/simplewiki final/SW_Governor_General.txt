Governor General is a representative of a head of state. The term is mostly used in Commonwealth countries, where the governor general is a representative of the monarch.
Sometimes the title is spelled as "Governor General", which is used in Canada, but sometimes it is spelled with a hyphen "-", "Governor-General", which is the spelling used in Australia.
