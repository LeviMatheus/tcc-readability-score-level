For Jewish people YHWH is the most holy name of God, as written in the ancient Hebrew language. The language has no vowels, so the pronunciation is disputed, but most academics agree that "Yahweh" would be the equivalent in modern English.
It has also been pronounced as "Jehovah". This is because Hebrew pointing, or vowel symbols, are often put underneath the YHWH, making יְהֹוָה.
Traditionally, religious Jews do not say this name aloud, as it is believed to be too sacred to be spoken, but often use substitutes when referring to the name of the their God, e.g., HaShem ("The Name") or Shem HaMeforash (“the unspeakable Name.”)
Today, all three Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) say that there is only one god, and so YHWH is frequently referred to as just "God", or "Allah" (which is the Arabic word for god). However, the Jewish Tanakh (also known by Christians as the Old testament), is not clear on this point, and refers to other gods in several places - most notably in the versions of the Commandments given at either Mount Sinai or Mount Horeb, and detailed in Exodus and Deuteronomy, both of which refer to other gods.
Sometimes the four letters are called the "Tetragrammaton", which is Greek for "four letters"
These four letters are usually JHWH in German, French and Dutch, and either YHWH, YHVH, JHWH or JHVH in English. In some English language bibles, it is written in all capital letters as "LORD," as in Jewish tradition. Others, such as the Jerusalem Bible use "Yahweh".
Jehovah and Yahweh are the most common English pronunciations of the Tetragrammaton. The Catholic Encyclopedia, Volume 8, 1910 edition, page 329, states: “Jehovah, the proper name of God in the Old Testament."
