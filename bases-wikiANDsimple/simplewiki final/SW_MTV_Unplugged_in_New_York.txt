"MTV Unplugged in New York" was the first out of two live albums by the American grunge band Nirvana. (The second one was "From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah".) It was recorded on November 18, 1993 as a part of the "MTV Unplugged" television series, which many artists and bands perform on. It was released on November 1, 1994, six months after the band had broken up because of the death of Kurt Cobain, who was the lead singer and guitarist.
It was unusual compared to other artists on the "MTV Unplugged" series, because Nirvana played mostly their less-famous songs and cover versions of other artists' songs. Most artists on the program played mainly their hits.
Four singles were released from the album. This was unusual because it was a live album. The singles were "About a Girl", "The Man Who Sold the World", "Where Did You Sleep Last Night", and "Lake of Fire". All of these except for "About a Girl" were covers.
