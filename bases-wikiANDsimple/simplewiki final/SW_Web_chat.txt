A web chat is a chat system to exchange information via the Web. People use a web browser to communicate with others. Apart from the browser you don't need anything else, which makes a web chat easy to use and ideal for people not very experienced with computers.
Usually, you use software like Chatspace and Pichat. On the technical side web chats are often written with Java, Flash or Ajax.
