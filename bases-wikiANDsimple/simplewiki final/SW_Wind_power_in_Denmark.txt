After the world's oil crises in the 1970s, Denmark started to develop wind power. In 1988, two years after the Chernobyl disaster, the Danes passed a law forbidding the construction of nuclear power plants.
The Danes were pioneers in developing commercial wind power during the 1970â€™s and today almost half of the wind turbines around the world are produced by Danish manufacturers such as Vestas.
Wind power in Denmark provided 18% of the electricity produced in Denmark in 2005, and cumulative installed capacity over recent years is shown in the Table below. However most of the wind power is exported abroad. The correlation between wind power and electricity export is very strong.
Wind turbines are popular with people in Denmark.
