153 Hilda is a very big asteroid in the farther Main belt. Because it is made of primitive carbonaceous materials, it has a very dark surface.
Hilda gives its name to an asteroid group called Hilda asteroids (or shorter "Hildas"). It is not an asteroid family since the members are not physically related. Instead they are asteroids locked in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Jupiter.
It was found by J. Palisa on November 2, 1875.
Hilda was seen to occult a star on December 31, 2002 from Japan.
It has a very low-amplitude light curve indicating a spherical body.
