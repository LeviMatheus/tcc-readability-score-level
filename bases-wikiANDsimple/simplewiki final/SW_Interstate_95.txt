Interstate 95 (usually called I-95) is an important Interstate highway that runs north to south in the eastern part of the United States. It is about 1,900 miles (about 3,050 kilometres) long. Its southern end is at U.S. Route 1 in Miami, Florida and its northern end is at the Canadian border in Maine. It connects many major cities in the eastern half of the United States.
Gap.
Interstate 95 has a very famous and confusing gap north of Trenton, New Jersey. Because a freeway in the area was canceled, travelers wishing to travel north past Trenton must use parts of Interstate 295 and Interstate 195 to continue on Interstate 95. There is project going on to fix this.
