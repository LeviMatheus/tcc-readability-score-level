Leif Ericson(c. 970 â€“ c. 1020) was a Norse explorer. He was the first European to travel to North America. Ericson was born in Iceland. His father was Erik the Red, who had created colonies in Greenland. Ericson is said to have visited North America long before anyone else in Europe did. The place he probably went to was Newfoundland in Canada.
