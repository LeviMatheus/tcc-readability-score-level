Civil law is a system of law in the world. It is different from criminal law. Unlike criminal law, civil law deals with disputes between people and/or organizations which can be compensated. For example, if a car crash victim asks for payments from the driver because of loss or injury that happened to him in an accident, this will be a civil law case.
