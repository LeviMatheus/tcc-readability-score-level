Spinosaurus (which means "spiny lizard") was a huge meat eating dinosaur. It grew up to 17 meters long. It had a two meter high sail on its back like Dimetrodon. Several uses have been suggested for this sail, such as to help control its body temperature, as a way to attract a mate, and to intimidate or frighten enemies. It lived in the Sahara Desert 95 million years ago.
Its bones were first discovered in Egypt in 1912 and named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. Two species, S. aegyptiacus and S. marocannus, are recognized by many paleontologists, although many say there is only one. It was featured in the film Jurassic Park III. Weighing 4-7 tons Spinosaurus was a huge predator that stood 16 feet, or 5 metres high. Spinosaurus looked like Baryonyx except it was larger and more heavily built. Six specimens of Spinosaurus have been uncovered. Spinosaurus is much longer than Tyrannosaurus but there are not that many discoveries to prove that Spinosaurus was larger than Tyrannosaurus.
