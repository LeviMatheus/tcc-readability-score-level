Saloth Sar (better known as Pol Pot) (May 19, 1925 â€“ April 15, 1998) was the Maoist-extremist leader of Cambodia/Kampuchea between 1975 and 1979. His government was called the Khmer Rouge. It was a military government. He turned Cambodia into a military dictatorship called Democratic Kampuchea. Between 1.7 and 3 million Cambodians were killed by his regime (a regime is a government based on a certain world view). He was not stopped until the Vietnamese Communists liberated Kampuchea in early 1979.
