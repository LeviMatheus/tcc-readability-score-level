Freedom of the press is a promise by a government not to punish journalists and other people who report the news for doing their job. It is an idea that is like freedom of speech, because it protects people from expressing their opinions or beliefs. Many countries have passed laws or constitutional amendments protecting freedom of the press.
Restrictions.
Like with freedom of speech, freedom of the press does not protect everything that a journalist writes. A journalist can be sued for libel, which is publishing news about a person that they know is false. Publishing copyrighted material is not legal in many countries. Writing about state secrets, like military plans, weapon designs, or other classified information is almost always illegal.
