An armistice is the effective end of a war, when the parties agree to stop fighting. The word comes from the Latin "arma", meaning weapons and "statium", meaning a stopping.
A truce or ceasefire usually refers to a "temporary" stop of hostilities for an agreed limited time or within a limited area. A truce may be needed in order to negotiate an armistice.
An armistice is not the same as a peace treaty, which may take months or even years to agree on. The 1953 Korean War armistice is a major example of an armistice which has not yet been followed by a peace treaty.
The United Nations Security Council often demands cease-fire of parties in modern conflicts. Armistices are always negotiated between the parties themselves and are thus generally seen as more binding than UN cease-fire resolutions in modern international law.
The most famous armistice is the Armistice with Germany at the end of World War I, on 11 November, 1918, signed near Compi√®gne, France, and effective at the "eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month."
