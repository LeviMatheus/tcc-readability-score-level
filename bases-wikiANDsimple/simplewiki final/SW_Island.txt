An island is a piece of ground that is surrounded by water. Water is all around an island. Islands are smaller than continents.
The largest island in the world is Greenland, unless Australia is believed to be an island.
Some islands are their own countries. Examples of islands that are their own countries include Cuba, Iceland, and Madagascar. There are many others. Other islands have many countries, for example Borneo and Hispaniola.
