All of these gases are found in air. They make up around 0.96% of the atmosphere. Noble gas compounds can be formed from noble gasses.
Ununoctium (element 118) is probably the next noble gas after Radon. However it has a half life of 0.89 ms, after which it decays to Ununhexium (Element 116). This means its use is probably limited.
