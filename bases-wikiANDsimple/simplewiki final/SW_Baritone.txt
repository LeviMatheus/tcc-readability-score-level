A baritone is a man with a voice range between that of a tenor (high male voice) and bass (low male voice).
Famous baritone roles in opera include: Papageno in Mozart's "The Magic Flute" and Figaro in Rossini's "The Barber of Seville".
Some baritones have voices not quite low enough to be a true bass, and prefer to call themselves bass-baritones. Bryn Terfel is a famous Welsh bass-baritone.
Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau is often thought of as the greatest baritone of the later 20th century. He was famous as a Lieder singer as well as on the concert stage and in opera.
