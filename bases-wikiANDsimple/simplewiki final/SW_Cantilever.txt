A Cantilever is a figure skating move. It is considered a "field move" because it is not a jump, a spin, or a spiral.
A cantilever is performed by a skater traveling on a deep lean across the ice, either in a spread eagle or a Besti squat position. The skater then bends backwards, so their back is parallel to the ice, while remaining on the deep lean. The hands can be draped across the ice or not. This is a very dramatic move on the ice.
It was invented by Werner Groebli, better known as "Mr. Frick", a long-time show skater with Ice Follies. It was brought back and populaizared by Ilia Klimkin of Russia, who performed it a lot in competition over many years.
