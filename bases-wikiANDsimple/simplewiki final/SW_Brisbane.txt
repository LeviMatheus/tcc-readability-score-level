Brisbane (local nickname "Brissie") is the capital of Queensland in the northeast of Australia.
The Brisbane River flows through the city.
1,730,000 people live there and there is both a Catholic and a Protestant Bishop.
Brisbane was founded in 1824 and was meant at first for prisoners who were embarked to Australia. The name comes from a Governor of New South Wales, Sir Thomas Brisbane.
