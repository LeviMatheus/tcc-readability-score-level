Technique means the skill used to do something: it could be playing a musical instrument or playing a kind of sport or even doing something simple like using a corkscrew. Someone who is trying to do something but not succeeding may be using the wrong technique. Technique does not always have to be something physical: it may refer to the way a person approaches a problem.
