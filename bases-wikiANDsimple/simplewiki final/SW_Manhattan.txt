Manhattan is an island, which is part of New York City. It is the center of New York and the smallest borough. The Dutch bought it from the Native Americans and called it New Amsterdam, later the English took it over and changed the name to New York. The name "Manhattan" comes from the Munsey language of the Lenni Lenape meaning "island of many hills". Other theories contend that it comes from one of three Munsey words. "Manahactanienk" meaning "place of inebriation. Other possibilities are "manahatouh" meaning "a place where wood is available for making bows and arrows" and "menatay" meaning simply "the island."
