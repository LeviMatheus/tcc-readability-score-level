Sir Syed Ahmed Khan Bahadur, GCSI (also Sayyid Ahmad Khan)(Urdu: سید احمد خان بہا در; October 17, 1817 – March 27, 1898) was a teacher and politician. He was also a social reformer. He founded the school that would later become Aligarh Muslim University. In 1857 there was a rebellion in India. This is known as the First Indian War of Independence. During this time, Bahadur kept loyal to the British; He also saved many European lives. After the rebellion he wrote a book where he said the British were in fact those who caused the rebellion.
Bahadur believed that Muslims were in a bad position in India because of their strong views. India at the time was occupied by the British. It was only in 1947 that it became independent (and two states: India, and Pakistan). Bahadur therefore introduced the western-style of scientific working; and organised Muslim Intellectuals.
He also thought that all Indian Muslims should use Urdu to talk to each other.
