A bow is a weapon used to shoot arrows. It is used in hunting, sport, and a long time ago war.
The use of a bow is called archery. A person who uses a bow is an archer, and a person who makes bows is a fletcher.
A bow is made up of a long curved stick and a string which is tied to both ends. Ancient bows were made of natural materials like wood or bone and sinew, but today they are often made of plastic and similar materials.
To shoot a bow, the arrow is put on the bow, with one end to the string, which is pulled back. When the string is let loose, it throws the arrow forwards.
There are many different types of bows, for example the longbow or the automatic crossbow.
