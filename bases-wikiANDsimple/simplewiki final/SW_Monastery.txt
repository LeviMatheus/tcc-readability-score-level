Monasteries are places where monks live. Although the word "monastery" is sometimes used for a place where nuns live, where nuns live is usually called a convent or nunnery. The word abbey (from the Syriac word "abba": "father") is also used for a Christian monastery or convent. The monk in charge of an abbey is called an abbot, the nun in charge of an abbey is an abbess.
There are several religions which have a system of monasteries. Christian monasteries have a chapel for the monks to worship. Monks are not allowed to marry (this is called "celibacy"). They are also not allowed to own anything. All the things they use, including their clothes, belong to the monastery. During the Dark Ages after the Roman Empire was defeated, monasteries were some of the few places where knowledge still existed.
Some monasteries were built in places far away from where other people lived. The monks who live there live very isolated lives, growing their own food and looking after one another. Other monasteries were in or near towns. The monks do a lot of work in the community, such as teaching, medical care or telling people about God. There are not many monks who live isolated lives nowadays. Monks have a tradition that they suecide after 20 years, so these monasteries have been used by tons of people.
