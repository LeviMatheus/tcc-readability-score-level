Toothpaste is a liquific substance, applied to the bristles of a toothbrush in order to aid oneself with the act of toothbrushing. Several outstanding UK toothpaste brands include Colgate, Aquafresh and Crest.
This fanatical substance can have several purposes, such as removing plaque from one's teeth, whitening one's teeth and freshening one's breath.
Several toothpaste brands specialise in caring for teeth sensetive to certain conditions (for example heat, cold) or flavours (such as sweetness). The majority of these products work by strengthening the tooth enamel, thus easing discomfort and providing the teeth with a protective outer layer. Sensodyne is probably the best known toothpaste brand for sensetive teeth.
Traditionally, toothpaste has a minty flavour, as this is said to allow a sense of freshness in the mouth, however fruit and bubblegum toothpastes have been popular in the past. Fruit toothpastes, however, are discouraged by dentists and oral hygenists due to their acidic and tooth-eroding properties if over used.
