An Ocean is a large area of salt water between continents. Oceans are very big and they join smaller seas together. All oceans in the world can be thought of as one "ocean", because all the "oceans" are joined.
The ocean is blue because it reflects the color of the sky.
The biggest ocean is the Pacific Ocean. It covers 1/3 (one third) of the Earth's surface.
The Smallest ocean is the Arctic Ocean.
There is a 'new' ocean, the Southern Ocean. It is the combination of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans around Antarctica. It is also known as the Antarctic Ocean.
The deepest ocean is the Pacific ocean, with the deepest point being 36,200 feet deep.
