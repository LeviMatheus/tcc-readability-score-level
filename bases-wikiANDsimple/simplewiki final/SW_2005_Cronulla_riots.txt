The 2005 Cronulla riots were a series of violence between Lebanese and white Australian mobs. Riots started in and around Cronulla, a suburb on the beach in Sydney, Australia's biggest city. The violence was soon also in other suburbs around Sydney. The riots happened on 11 December, 12 December and 14 December.
They started when a group of Lebanese men asked a white Australian woman on a beach with a bikini on to cover up.
