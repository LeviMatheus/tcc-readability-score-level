The Leaving Certificate is the final exam taken place in the Republic of Ireland secondary school education system. To do the leaving cert, the Junior Certificate exams need to be done first.
As the Junior Certificate, Maths, English, and Irish (That is, if Irish was done for the Junior Cert) are compulsory. For the Leaving Cert, at least six subjects need to be done. Any exam may be done either in a Higher or Ordinary level. Irish and Mathematics offer a 'Foundation' level. Foundation level is where the exams just asks about the most basic teaching on the course, for those who have a hard time doing that particular subject.
The results are given out in the middle of August. A leaving certificate is required in order to go on to college or university.
