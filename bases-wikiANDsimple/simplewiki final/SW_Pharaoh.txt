Pharaohs were the rulers of ancient Egypt. They wore a red and white crown, which means that they ruled both Upper and Lower Egypt. The word comes from the Egyptian word "Per-aa", which means "Great House". Pharaohs were believed to be descended from the gods.
When a pharoah died, all the treasure that they owned would be buried with them.
Pharaoh is also the name of a 1999 city-builder game by Impressions Games and Sierra Entertainment.
