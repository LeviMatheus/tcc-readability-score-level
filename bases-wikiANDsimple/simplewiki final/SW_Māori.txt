The Māori are the indigenous people of New Zealand.
History.
Their Polynesian ancestors came to New Zealand between 800 and 1300 AD. They probably came from the Cook Islands. About 600,000 Māori live in New Zealand today.
During World War II, Māori soldiers were famous as brave warriors because they won many difficult battles and stayed strong in the face of danger.
Origin.
Before Europeans came to New Zealand, the Māori did not have a name for themselves. After Europeans came to New Zealand, the indigenous people called themselves "māori", which means "normal" or "ordinary" in the Māori language. The word "māori" contrasts with "pākehā", who are all people not "māori". Today, in New Zealand English "pakeha" means New Zealand European.
