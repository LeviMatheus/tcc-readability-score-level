Scientology is a type of belief of some people. It was started in 1950. In some countries, it has won the status of a religion. Many countries see the organisation behind it very sceptically. They say, scientology is a cult, and a machine to make money. Scientology has been very controversial, since its beginnings.
According to the organisation there are over 10 million people in it. Critics say however, that the organisation probably does not have many more than 100.000 people following the doctrine, most of them from the United States. In the 1960, there were probably 50.000 to 100.000 followers in the US. In the 1990s, a representative survey claimed there were only about 45.000 followers left. These figures seemed to have improved a bit, by 2004, where there were an estimated 55.000 followers.
