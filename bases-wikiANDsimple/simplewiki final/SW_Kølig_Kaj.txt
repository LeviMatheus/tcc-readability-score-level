Kølig Kaj was a Danish rapper who gained national fame in 1997 by winning the Danish Melodi Grand Prix with his song "Stemmen I Mit Liv". His real name is "Thomas Lægaard".
At the Eurovision Song Contest in 1997, he ended up 16th, with only 25 points. Following that, Kølig Kaj slowly went away, and has never really gained much success. "Kølig Kaj" literally means "Cool Kaj" (pronounced Kai, rhymes with "high"). He released an album called "Solgt Ud!"
