"Garfield" is a famous comic strip created by Jim Davis. It has the cat Garfield, the dog Odie, and their owner Jon Arbuckle. The cat is named after Davis's grandfather, James Garfield Davis (who was probably named after former U.S. President James Garfield). It first debuted in 1978 in 41 US newspapers. "Garfield at Large" was Garfield's first book that debuted in 1980 and was listed in New York Times bestseller lists at #1. By 1983 Garfield featured in 1400 newspapers, and was translated into seven different languages.
Garfield finally got his own website in 1996. In 2002, Garfield was declared "Most widely syndicated comic strip in the world" by Guinness Book of World Records. Garfield's 1st cookbook featured in 2003. In 2004 "Garfield the Movie" was his first full-length feature film to hit the cinemas.
