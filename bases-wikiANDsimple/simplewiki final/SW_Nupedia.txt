Nupedia was a website with encyclopedia pages. It was created by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger in 2000.
Unlike Wikipedia, only scholars (people who know a lot of stuff) could edit the articles, and all of the changes went through a review process. This made it harder to make articles, and soon became overlooked by Wikipedia, which anyone can edit.
By the time the site was closed in September 2003, there were 24 articles on Nupedia, with another 74 articles ready to be made. When Wikipedia took over, the articles from Nupedia were moved there, and those were the first articles of Wikipedia.
