The Kabyles ("Leqbayel" in Kabyle pronounced)) are a Berber people. Their traditional homeland is highlands of Kabylie (or Kabylia) in northeastern Algeria.
Their name comes from the name of the mountainous region in the north of Algeria where they live traditionally. It means "tribes" (from the Arabic "qaba'il" which is the plural of "qabîlah" قبيلة tribe). They speak the Kabyle variety of Berber. Kabyles have been very active to fight for the official recognition of the Berber language in Algeria.
