The Persians are an Iranic ethnic group who speak the Persian language and share the same culture and history. The word "Persia" comes from the name Greek people gave to Iran from many years ago. In the Western writings, it is common to name all old Iraninans as Persian, although some of the old Iranian people where not from Persian culture, and didn't speak in Persian language.
Persian people include many groups, like Tajiks, Tats, etc. Most of them live in Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
