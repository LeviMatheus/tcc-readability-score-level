An eclipse is an astronomical event. It is when one celestial object moves into the shadow of another celestial object. The term "eclipse" is most often used to describe a "solar eclipse", when the Moon's shadow crosses the Earth's surface, or a "lunar eclipse", when the Moon moves into the shadow of Earth.
