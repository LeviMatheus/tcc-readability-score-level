Endospores are objects made by bacteria for survival purposes. They have a tough coating which is resistant to radiation (like X-rays and UV light) and chemicals.
A Bacterial cell will make an endospore when it is low on food so it can survive until there is more food available in the environment. An endospore will actually contain all of the important parts of the bacterial cell, such as its DNA.
