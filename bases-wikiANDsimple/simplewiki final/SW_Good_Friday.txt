Good Friday is a holy day that Christians celebrate on the Friday before Easter. It is a special day because it remembers Jesus. All Christians believe that Jesus Christ died on the cross for the sins of the world, therefore this day is called "Good" Friday. The event happened nearly two thousand years ago on the Calvary, near Jerusalem, and his death on the cross, which is painful because nails are used to put him on the cross, is known as the cruxifixion.
Special prayer services are often held on this day with readings from the Gospel accounts of the events leading up to the crucifixion. Major Christian churches say that Christ's crucifixion as a voluntary act, which he did on behalf of everyone who believes in him, and also one by which, along with resurrection on the third day, death itself was conquered.
