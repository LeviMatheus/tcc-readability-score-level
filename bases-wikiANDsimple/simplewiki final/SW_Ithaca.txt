Ithaca (Ithaka or Ithaki; Greek: Ιθάκη) is one of the Ionian Islands on the west coast of Greece. It is about long and wide. In 2001 there were about 3,000 people living there.
Odysseus was said to be the king of Ithaca in the epic poem the "Odyssey", which was written in the Ancient Greek language. It is possible that this ancient island is in a different place to the modern island.
