The English Reformation was part of a process and movement of thought, referred to as the Protestant Reformation, which led to the breaking away of a number of Christian churches in Europe from communion with Rome.
Each of the countries that went through this process did so in a different way, so the process in England was singular. The king became head of the English church by what was called the Royal Supremacy and that was the beginning of the Church of England.
