The Edwardian period or Edwardian era in the United Kingdom is the period covering the reign of King Edward VII, 1901 to 1910.
When Queen Victoria, Empress of India died in January 1901 the succession of her son, Edward, marked the start of a new century and the end of the Victorian period. While Victoria had shunned society, Edward was the leader of a fashionable elite which set a style influenced by the art and fashions of continental Europeâ€”perhaps because of the King's fondness for travel. The era was marked by significant shifts in politics as sections of society which had been largely excluded from wielding power in the past, such as common labourers and women, became increasingly politicised.
The period is often extended beyond Edward's death in 1910 to include the years up to the sinking of the RMS "Titanic" in 1912, the start of World War I in 1914, or even the end of the war in 1918. The war sealed the end of the period as the Edwardian way of life, with its inherent imbalance of wealth and power, became increasingly anachronistic in the eyes of a population suffering in the face of war, and exposed to elements of a new mass media which decried the injustice of class division.
