The capital of the region is Caen. 1.3 million people live in the region, 220.000 of them in the urban area of Caen.
The region's economoy is centered on agriculture. Cider is made there, but livestock is also farmed. There is a bit of textile industry as well. It is the first region of France when it comes to producing butter, cheese and horses. The west part of the region is used mainly for farming, because of the prairies. Camembert, Pont-l'évêque and Livarot cheeses come from this region.
