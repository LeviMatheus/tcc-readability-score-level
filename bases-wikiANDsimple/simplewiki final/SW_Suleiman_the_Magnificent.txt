Suleiman I (سليمان "Sulaymān", Süleyman; almost always "Kanuni Sultan Süleyman" in Turkish) (November 6, 1494 – September 5/6, 1566), was the tenth Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. He reigned from 1520 to 1566. That was longer than any other Ottoman sultan did. He is known in the West as Suleiman the Magnificent and in the Islamic world, as the Lawgiver (in Turkish "Kanuni";, "al‐Qānūnī"), because he reconstructed the Ottoman legal system.
