Biography.
He studied law in Munich, Bavaria and took the first stage law exam in 1957. In 1958, he gained the title Dr.jur. (doctor of laws) and worked in the University of Munich until 1964, where he passed his second law exam. He wrote "Die Wesensmerkmale der Staatsorganisation in rechtlicher und entwicklungsgeschichtlicher Sicht" ("Characteristics of State Organization from a Juristic and Developmental-Historical Viewpoint"), and was given the title of professor in 1964. In Germany "professor" is a title meaning senior teacher, not a job name. Herzog taught at the University of Munich until 1966. From 1966 he taught state law and political science as a full professor at the Free University of Berlin (FUB). In 1969 he moved to the FUB in Speyer, and was the University President from 1971 to 1972.
In 1973 he entered politics, and became a member of the Bundesrat for Rhineland-Palatinate. He was minister for culture and sports in the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Land Government from 1978. In 1980 he was elected to the State Parliament ("Landtag"), and took over the state Ministry of the Interior.
Roman Herzog was also always active in the Protestant Church. Since 1982 he has been a member of the synod (parliament) of the Protestant Church of Germany. He has been a member of the Evangelical Church in Germany since 1972.
In 1983 he became vice president of the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany in Karlsruhe, and president over from 1987 to 1994, when he was elected President of Germany by the Bundesversammlung ("Federal Convention"). His term ended in 1999, when he was succeeded by Johannes Rau.
