Smash Hits was a pop music based magazine. It was made for children and young teenagers. The magazine was first published in the United Kingdom. It ran from 1978 to 2006 and was issued fortnightly for most of that time. The name survives as a brand for a related spin-off digital television channel, digital radio station, and website which have survived the end of the printed magazine.
