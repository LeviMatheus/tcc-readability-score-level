A gyrobus is a special bus which doesn't use a normal engine. It has a big wheel of steel or other materials (weighing about one ton). This big wheel moves the wheels of the bus. At special stations, electric engines accelerate the wheel so the bus can still drive. There are not many buses of this kind because they are very expensive.
