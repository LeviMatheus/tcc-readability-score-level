Bel canto is a way of singing in opera. It comes from the Italian meaning "beautiful singing".
Bel canto singing means singing beautifully and smoothly, singing high and low notes in a similar style so that the notes sound even from top to bottom. Bel canto singing started when opera started, but the term "bel canto" is normally used for opera in the early 19th century. The operas of Rossini, Bellini and Donizetti need bel canto singing. The term "bel canto" was not used at the time. People started talking about "bel canto" in the late 19th century when a lot of operas needed big, dramatic voices (e.g. the operas of Wagner).
Famous bel canto singers of recent times include the sopranos Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Mathilde Marchesi was a famous bel canto teacher.
Trivia.
Musicians often make jokes about singers with loud voices by calling them "can belto" ("to belt out" means to sing loudly).
