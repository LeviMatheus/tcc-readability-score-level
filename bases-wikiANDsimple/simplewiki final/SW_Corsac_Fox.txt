The Corsac Fox ("Vulpes corsac"), also known as the Steppe Fox, is a medium-sized Asiatic fox species. It is spread throughout the central steppes of Asia. It is very social and lives in "corsac cities" where animals have several dens with connected holes. It prefers some steppe and semi-desert in mountainous areas. It is mainly grey-reddish with silver celadon areas on their coat. The Corsac Fox is threatened by hunting for the fur trade.
