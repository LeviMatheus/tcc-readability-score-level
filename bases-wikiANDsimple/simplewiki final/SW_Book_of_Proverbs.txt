The Book of Proverbs is a book in both the Tanakh (Judaism), and the Old Testament (Christianity). The book contains some of the most important teaching and instructions in each of their respective Religions.
Most scholars believe that Solomon was the writer of at least part of the book. Other authors are mentioned as well, but these references are missing in the Greek Septuagint. The Septuagint sees King Solomon as the author of the whole Book of Proverbs. In the Middle Ages, scholars thought the Vulgate was a more faithful rendering of 30:1 and 31:1. In their eyes the words "Agur" and "Lamuel" were only other names for Solomon.
Dates for the writing of the book are unclear. Because of suggested authorship of Solomon, and the workings of Hezekiah's men, there are some dates that can be worked with. However there are not enough to give specific timing to the completion of the book, though it could have been as late as third century BC
