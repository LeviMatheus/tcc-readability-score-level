Jaws is a 1975 thriller movie directed by Steven Spielberg.
The events of the movie are set in the small, quiet, rural town of Amity. The movie follows three men as they try to capture and kill a great white shark that is causing the town to be under threat on Independence Day. The movie follows Martin Brody, the slightly unheroic local sheriff who must decide whether to follow his instinct to shut the beach for safety reasons or keep the beach open to help the local tourist economy. Matt Hooper, a marine biologist, and Quint, the local shark hunter, help Brody to overcome his fears of the water and stop the great white shark attacks.
