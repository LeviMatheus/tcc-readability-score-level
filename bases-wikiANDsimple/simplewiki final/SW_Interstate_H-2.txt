Interstate H-2 (abbreviated H-2) is an intrastate interstate highway located on the island of O‘ahu in Hawai‘i, USA. H-2 is also known as the Veterans Memorial Freeway. Despite the number, this is a north-south interstate—the 'H'-series (for Hawaii) numbering reflects the order in which routes were funded and built. Its southern terminus is at Interstate H-1 in Pearl City, and its northern terminus is at Wilikina Drive (Route 99) in Wahiawā near Schofield Barracks and Wheeler Army Airfield.
