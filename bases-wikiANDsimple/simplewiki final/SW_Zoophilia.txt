Zoophilia is a type of paraphilia. People who have it feel sexually attracted to non-human animals. These people are called zoophiles. A separate term, "bestiality", refers to human/animal sexual activity.
Human-goat sexual intercourse.
Human-goat sexual intercourse is a sexual activity between a person and a goat, an agile, hollow-horned, bearded ruminant mammal. Human-goat sexual intercourse is one of the more common types of bestiality; of male zoophiles, 28% admitted sexual attraction to goats, ranking fourth. In female zoophiles sexual attraction to goats is very rare or non-existent. Actual levels of sexual contact were lower than this however.
Goat sex is usually performed by a male human upon a goat of either gender. Male goats do not commonly take the initiative to copulate with a human female although some cases have been reported. The goat will often bleat in an unusual manner as the act is committed. Reports of the animals after being sodomized have described them as "subdued".
