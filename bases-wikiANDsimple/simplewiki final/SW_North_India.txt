Northern India, also known as Hindustan, is a land and cultural region of India. In traditional Indian geography, India is pieced into five major zones: North India, North-East India, East India, West India and South India.
As a linguistic-cultural and political region, North India consists of twelve Indian states: Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhatisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan (Bihar and Jharkhand are also considered as parts of East India). The National Capital Territory of Delhi is also a part of northern India. It shares most of its cultural, historical, musical, and linguistic heritage with neighboring Pakistan and Kashmir, which was part of the region before the partition of British India in "Dominion of Pakistan" (later Islamic Republic of Pakistan) and "Union of India" (later Republic of India) in 1947.
