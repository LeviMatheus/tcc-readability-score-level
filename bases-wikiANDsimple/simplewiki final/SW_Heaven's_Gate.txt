Heaven's Gate was the name of a UFO group led by Marshall Applewhite and Bonnie Nettles, until their deaths.
The group ended with the appearance of Comet Hale-Bopp, in the United States in the year 1997. Applewhite convinced 38 followers to kill themselves so that their souls could ride on a spaceship they believed was hiding behind the comet. Beliefs such as this led some people to call this a type of "UFO Religion".
