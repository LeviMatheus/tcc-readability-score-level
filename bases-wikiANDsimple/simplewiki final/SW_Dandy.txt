A dandy is a man who shows off by dressing very elegantly and fashionably. He exaggerates his manners, including the way he stands and moves, and the way he speaks. It is called Dandyism.
Dandies in the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States and Great Britain were often men from middle-class backgrounds who were trying to become people from high society.
Well known people who were dandies include the writer Oscar Wilde, the American artist James McNeill Whistler, and the French composer Maurice Ravel.
Today, in the 21st century, the word "dandy" is often used as a joke word to mean "fine" or "great".
The female equivalent is a quaintrelle.
