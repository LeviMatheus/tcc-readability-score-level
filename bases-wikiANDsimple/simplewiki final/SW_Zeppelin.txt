A Zeppelin is an airship. It is rigid, but can be directed. It was developed by Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, in the early 20th century. Zepplelins were used in the First World War. In the Second World War the Nazis largely used them for propaganda purposes.
One of the most well-known Zeppelins was the LZ 129 Hindenburg, which caught fire on May 6, 1937, during a landing after a non-stop trip from Germany to New Jersey in the United States. After the Second World War and the fall of the Nazis in Germany, Zeppelins weren't used anymore. Plans exist to use Zepppelins to lift heavy weights. Sometimes, they are also used as tourist attractions, or for advertising.
