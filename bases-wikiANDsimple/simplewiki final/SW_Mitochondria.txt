Mitochondria (from Greek "μίτος" or "mitos", thread + "χονδρίον" or "khondrion", granule) are organelles, or parts of a cell. Their job is to make energy from the food that the cell takes in. It does this with cellular respiration, which makes ATP which the cell can use as energy. In general, the main job of the cell is to do photosynthesis. Thank you for your time.
