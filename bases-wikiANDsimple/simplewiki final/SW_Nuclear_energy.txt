Nuclear energy is the energy that holds together the nucleii of atoms. Atoms are the most basic blocks that make up matter. Every atom has in its center a very small nucleus. Normally nuclear energy is hidden inside the atoms. However, some atoms are radioactive and send off part of their nuclear energy as radiation. Radiation is given off from the nucleus of unstable isotopes of radioactive substances.
Nuclear energy can also be freed in two ways: nuclear fusion and nuclear fission. Nuclear fusion is the combining of two atoms into one and nuclear fission is the splitting of an atom. Both ways create large amounts of energy. They some times take place in the nature. Fusion is the source of heat in the sun. Fission is also used in nuclear power plants to make electricity. Both fusion and fission can be used in nuclear weapons.
