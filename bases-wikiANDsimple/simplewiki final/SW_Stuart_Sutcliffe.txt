Stuart Fergusson Victor Sutcliffe (June 23, 1940 â€“ April 10, 1962) was an early member of the English band The Beatles. He was the band's original bass guitarist, but left before they became famous. He wanted to be an artist, and he returned to art school, which he had quit to join the Beatles.
Sutcliffe died in 1962 from a brain hemorrhage. It was long thought that the hemorrhage was from a fight with locals after a concert in 1961, but it is now believed he may have been born with a medical condition which caused it.
