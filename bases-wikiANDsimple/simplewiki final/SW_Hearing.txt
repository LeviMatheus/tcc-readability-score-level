Hearing is one of the five senses. The ears are used for hearing (listening to) sounds. The noun form of hearing may also be used to refer to a meeting, usually one where the public is invited to come and help decide something.
Sometimes the phrase "I hear you." can be used to mean, "I understand." It is harder to hear a sound made farther away. It is also harder to hear a sound when other sounds are louder.
