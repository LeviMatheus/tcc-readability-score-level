(September 14, 1769 â€“ May 6, 1859) was a Prussian naturalist and explorer. His older brother was the Prussian minister, philosopher, and linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt. Humboldt's work on botanical geography was very important in the field of biogeography.
Humboldt was born in Berlin. His father, Alexander Georg von Humboldt, was a rewarded major in the Prussian Army. He married Maria Elizabeth von Colomb in 1766. The couple had two sons, the younger was Alexander.
In his childhood Humboldt already liked to collect plants, shells, and insects. Humboldt's father died very early (in 1799). From that time on his mother took care of his education.
Between 1799 and 1804, Humboldt travelled to Latin America and was the first scientist who wrote about it. He was one of the first who said that South America and Africa was once one continent.
Late in his life he attempted to bring together different fields of science in his work "Kosmos".
