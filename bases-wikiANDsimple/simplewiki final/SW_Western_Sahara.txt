Western Sahara is a country in Africa. To the north is Morocco, to the east is Algeria, to the south is Mauritania, and to the west is the Atlantic Ocean. The country of Spain owned it between 1884 and 1976. In 1976, the country of Morocco took it, but most of the people in Western Sahara want independence. The largest city in Western Sahara is El Aai√∫n (some people call it "Laayoune"). Few people live there, since it is in a very hot desert.
Some countries say that the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic should be the government in Western Sahara. Morocco says that they own it. The Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic was made by the "Polisario Front" a group of people who wanted Spain to leave, but now want Morocco to leave also.
