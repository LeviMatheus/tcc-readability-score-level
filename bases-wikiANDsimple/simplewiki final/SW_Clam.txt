A clam is a type of shellfish. Clams can be found in saltwater and freshwater. Clams eat plankton, and are eaten by small sharks and squid. Clams can be eaten by people. They may be found on menus in restaurants that serve seafood. Clams are a fairly common form of bivalve, therefore making it part of the phylum mollusca. Clams are abundant in the seas but can also be found in some lakes, streams, and rivers.
