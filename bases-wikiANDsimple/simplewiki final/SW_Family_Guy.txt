"Family Guy" is a 1999 animated comedy television series created by Seth MacFarlane. It first was shown on FOX. The series did not become popular until shown again on Cartoon Network and TBS, and episodes were sold on DVDs. Fox chose to cancel the series because it was not very popular. After many DVDs were sold, Fox started showing it again.
The series is about the lives of Peter Griffin; his wife, Lois; their three children, 16-year old Meg, 13-year old Chris, and very smart baby Stewie; and also their very smart dog, Brian (who can talk and acts like a human). The Griffins live in a fictional city named "Quahog," Rhode Island. The show puts humor into common everyday situations and is famous for their special style of comedy that always shows scenes from the past. Most of the scenes do not affect the show's stories in any way. The show also uses a lot of profanity.
