The Flag of Thailand has five rows of stripes in the colours red, white, and blue. The middle blue stripe is two times as wide as other four. The three colours red-white-blue stand for nation-religion-king, an unofficial motto of Thailand. The flag was made official on 28 September 1917 by a royal decree about the flag in that year. The Thai name for the flag is ธงไตรรงค์ ("Thong Trairong"). The name means tricolour flag.
