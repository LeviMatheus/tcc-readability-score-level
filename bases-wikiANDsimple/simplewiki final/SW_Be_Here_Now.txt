"Be Here Now" is the title of a 1971 book on spirituality by Ram Dass. The title comes from a repeated teaching of his guide and friend, Bhagavan Das.
The book has four sections: Journey: "The Transformation", "From Bindu to Ojas", "Cookbook for a Sacred Life", and "Painted Cakes". The first part tells about Ram Dass' life and how he came to change his name from Dr. Richard Alpert to Baba Ram Dass. The second part is the biggest part and has many spiritual sayings together with beautiful pictures. The third is a manual or 'cookbook' for changing one's own life and includes how to do some yoga, pranayama, and meditation. It also tells some of the things that were said by great teachers of all religions and traditions. Finally, the last section contains a list of spiritual books we should "hang out with."
"Be Here Now" helps people learn how to change to a yogic lifestyle. It has helped many people to follow their own path with new faith and passion. At first, it was made in pamphlet form by Lama Foundation. In the summer of 1977, Lama Foundation gave the rights and half the money from the book to Hanuman Foundation. It is now in its 37th printing and has sold over one million copies.
