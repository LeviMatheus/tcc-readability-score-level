Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (Russian: Фёдор Миха́йлович Достое́вский, "Fëdor Mihajlovič Dostoevskij", sometimes transliterated Dostoyevsky) (November 11,1821 (October 30, old style) – February 9,1881 (January 28,old style) was a Russian writer. Many people see him as one of the greatest of Russian writers. His works have had a big effect on twentieth-century fiction.Very often, he wrote about characters who live in poor conditions. Those characters are sometimes in extreme states of mind. They might show both a strange grasp of human psychology as well as good analyses of the political, social and spiritual states of Russia of Dostoevsky's time. Many of his best-known works are prophetic. He is sometimes considered to be a founder of existentialism, most frequently for "Notes from Underground", which has been described by Walter Kaufmann as "the best overture for existentialism ever written".
