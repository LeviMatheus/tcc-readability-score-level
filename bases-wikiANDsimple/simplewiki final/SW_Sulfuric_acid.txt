Sulfuric acid, or Sulphuric acid H2SO4, is an acid. It will dissolve in water. It was once known as "oil of vitriol". This name was created by Jabir ibn Hayyan, the person who discovered it. Sulfuric acid has many uses, and is made more than any chemical besides water. World production in 2001 was 165 million tonnes, worth about $8 billion. Uses include ore processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and combining chemicals for scientific reasons. Many proteins are made of amino acids that have sulfur in them (like cysteine and methionine) which produce sulfuric acid when the body uses them. Sulfulic acid is very poisonous and corrosive.
