Walter Edward Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne (29 March 1880 â€“ 6 November 1944) was a British politician. Guinness was born in Dublin, Ireland. He was killed in 1944 in Cairo, Egypt by the Jewish group Lehi. His assassination was said to be a message to the British government against British imperialism. Guinness was selected because he was believed to be anti Jewish and made statements supporting sending all Jews in Europe to the African island of Madagascar.
