Marsupials are a type of mammals. This group is also called "Marsupialia" or "Metatheria".
They give birth to living babies and they feed their babies milk. But their babies are born very young and very small. Marsupials have a special pouch where they carry their babies. After the birth the baby goes into its mother's pouch, where it can drink milk and is kept warm and safe. When the babies are very young they stay in the pouch all the time, but when they are older they can leave it for short times. When they are old enough and too big for the pouch they do not go into their mother's pouch anymore.
