Controversy.
On April 18, 2008, ABC News reported that one of the shots of the Antarctic glaciers in the movie was made by computer and used in the 2004 movie The Day After Tomorrow. In "An Inconvenient Truth", the audience is shown the glacier scene while "Al Gore" was saying, "And if you were flying over it in a helicopter, you'd see it's 700 feet tall. They are so majestic." The movie has received much criticism from some who feel Mr. Gore's voice-over indicates the computer shot used was a real one.
