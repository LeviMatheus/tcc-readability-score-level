The Hague (with capital T; Dutch: also called 's-Gravenhage, commonly Den Haag) is the third-largest city in the Netherlands, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It has a population of 472,087 (January 1 2005) (700,000 in the greater metropolitan area) and an area of around 100 kmÂ². It is in the west of the country, in the province South Holland.

Den Haag is where the government meets, even though it is not the capital of the Netherlands. The Dutch constitution makes Amsterdam the capital.
The Hague is the home of the "Eerste Kamer" (literally "First Chamber") or "Senaat", and the "Tweede Kamer" (literally "Second Chamber"). These are the same as the upper and lower houses in some other countries. They form the "Staten Generaal" (literally the "Estates-General"). The Dutch Queen Beatrix lives and works in The Hague. All foreign embassies and government ministries are in the city, as well as the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (The Supreme Court) and many lobbying organisations.
