Leh was the capital of the Himalayan kingdom of Ladakh, now the Leh District in the state of Indian Occupied Kashmir, Asia. The town is still dominated by the now ruined Leh Palace, former home of the royal family of Ladakh, which resembles a mini-Potala Palace. Leh is at an altitude of 3,500 meters (11,483ft). At a distance from the right bank of the Indus River, Leh and other places of Ladakh are renowned for Buddhist cultural mysteries, lamas and monasteries. The wonders of this land include golden statue of lord Buddha, high class paintings, ancient manuscripts and the monasteries. The famous moasteries include Hemis, Aalchi, Chuglamsar, Mulbekh, Shey, Spitak, and Thiksey. The famous mosque of Leh was built by prince Namgyal Singe in 1594. The mosque is a fine model of Turkish and Iranian architecture. The first Muslim ruler of Kashmir, Sultan Sadruddin was a Ladakhi. His real name was Gialpo, (Prince) Renchan.
