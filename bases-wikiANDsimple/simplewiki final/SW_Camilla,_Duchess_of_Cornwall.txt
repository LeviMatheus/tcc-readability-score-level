The Duchess of Cornwall (Camilla Rosemary; formerly Parker Bowles; née Shand; born 17 July 1947) is the wife of The Prince of Wales.
Marriage to Prince Charles.
Prince Charles and Camilla married eachother on 9 April 2005, and she started to be called "Her Royal Highness" The Duchess of Cornwall. When their engagement was announced, it was also announced that she would not be known as "The Princess of Wales" — this was because Prince Charles' extremely popular first wife, Diana, was known as that up until her death in 1997. The Duchess now makes many visits, mostly in Great Britain — often with Prince Charles, but sometimes on her own. She lives at Clarence House, which is a part of St James's Palace in London (very close to Buckingham Palace). She lives there with Prince Charles and his sons, Prince William and Prince Harry
Family.
Camilla was married once before, to Andrew Parker Bowles — they married in 1973 and divorced in 1995. The couple had two children, Tom and Laura, both of whom are now married themselves. Tom is married to Sara, and they have a daughter, Lola (born in 2007). Laura is married to Harry Lopes, and has a daughter, Eliza, born in 2008.
