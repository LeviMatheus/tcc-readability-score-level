Loudness is a heavy metal band from Japan. The band was founded in 1981 by singer Akira Takasaki and drummer Munetaka Higuchi. Loudness was the first Japanese heavy metal band to be signed to a recording contract in the United States. They were ultimately dropped from their label in 1987 after an incident in which Takasaki was found attempting to molest the child of an executive at their label.
