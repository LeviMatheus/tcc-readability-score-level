A chameleon is a reptile. Some kinds of this animal change the colours of their skins under influence of mood, light and temperature. Chameleons have long sticky tongues that they can stretch up to two times their body size. Their eyes can move independently. The name chameleon means an earth lion which comes from the Greek word chamai which means earth and leon meaning lion. They are lizards with scales and feet eclipsed with sharp claws. The largest species is about 1.5 feet when fully grown. They are mainly insectivores, but they do take occasional smaller lizards. They can be found in Europe, the USA, and Africa (mostly Madagascar).
