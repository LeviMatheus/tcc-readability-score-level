Narvi or Saturn XXXI, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by a team of astronomers led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and given the designation S/2003 S 1.
Description.
Narvi is about 6.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 19,371,000 km in 1006.541 days, at an inclination of 137° to the ecliptic (109° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.320.
Naming.
It was named in January 2005 after Narvi from Norse mythology, also known as Narfi or Nari, a son of Loki by Sigyn who was killed to punish Loki for his crimes. The gods turned his brother Váli into a slavering wolf who tore his throat out. His entrails were used to bind Loki to a stone slab for all eternity, or at least until Ragnarok. The name was approved by the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature on January 21, 2005.
