The Asian Elephant ("Elephas maximus") is a elephant species living in Asia. They are more easily tamed than their larger African counterparts, and have been used as beasts of burden for centuries.
Physical Description.
Asian elephants are distinguished from their African counterparts by their smaller size, smaller ears, more rounded back, and a fourth toenail on each of their hind feet. They have thick, dry skin with a small amount of stiff hair, and are grey to brown in colour. Female Asian elephants have rudimentary tusks.
Distribution.
Asian elephants have an extensive range across India (National animal) and Sri Lanka and also occur further south and east as far as Sumatra. These three areas appear to contain subspecies all with slightly different characteristics.hi
Habitat.
Asian elephants are spread over areas where rainfall levels vary considerably. They can survive in dry places where less than 40cm of rain falls per year, and in wet areas where over 8m of rain can fall in a year.
