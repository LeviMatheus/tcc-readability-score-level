Ernest Shackleton (15 February 1874 â€“ 5 January 1922) was an Anglo-Irish explorer.
Early life.
Ernest Henry Shackleton was born at Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland. The Shackletons were originally from Yorkshire. The first member of this family was Abraham Shackleton, a Quaker, who moved to Ireland early in the 18th century and started a school at Ballitore, near Dublin. His father, Henry, wanted to enter the army but his poor health prevented him.
Ernest's mother, born Henrietta Letitia Sophia Ganan, married his father in 1872, bringing some Irish blood into the Anglo-Irish family. Henry Shackleton was a survivalist. He had left the farm before it was too late. When he was 33 years old, he left his farm to go to Trinity College in Dublin to start a new career in medicine.
