In Ancient Rome, a province (Latin, "provincia", pl. "provinciae") was the basic and until (circa 300) largest territorial and administrative unit of the empire's territorial possessions outside of the peninsula of Italy. The word "province" in modern English has its origins in the term used by the Romans.
