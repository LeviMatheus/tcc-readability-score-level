The doner kebab (or "donner kebab", but seldom "d√∂ner") kebab with salad and sauce is a very popular dish in the United Kingdom.
The usual kebab supplier (or "kebab shops") in the UK will offer hot chilli sauce and garlic yoghurt-style sauce. In different areas of the UK barbecue sauce, burger sauce, lemon juice, or a mint sauce similar to raita is also popular.
UK "doner kebab" often uses a different mixture of spices, because immigrants from Cyprus operate a major proportion of the takeaways. Menus typically offer doner, shish (lamb and chicken) and kofte kebabs, with a 'special' including portions of each with bread and chips. "Doner meat" is often also offered as a pizza or burger topping in such establishments.
The part of the animal used to produce the meat is not generally made clear; consequently, there are a lot of myths and jokes flying around as to the source.
