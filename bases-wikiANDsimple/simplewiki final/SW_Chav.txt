Chav, Charv/Charver (male) and Chavette (female) ('ch' pronounced as in chair) are mainly negative slang words in the United Kingdom for a subcultural stereotype of people who wear fashions based on American Hip-hop such as fake gold jewellery and designer clothing, combined with elements of working class British street fashion. The term first appeared in dictionaries in 2005.
The Stereotype of "Chav".
Chav has started to mean a variety of things. Chavs usually wear Burberry (Caps, Hats and gloves). Usually the Burberry Chavs wear is fake. Chavs are narrow-minded and Xenophobic sometimes Rascist and, more often than not, not very clever. Chavs also tend to use slang language to appear more "cool".
Chavs are usually associated with petty crime, such as muggings and robbery.
The Chav Attitude.
As well as hating anyone who does not belong to their group, they start fights for pleasure. Emos and Goths are often followed and hurt, usually on Goth or Emo against many more Chavs, simply because they are different. Chav are often arrogant, and always believe that they are right, in fighting or in other matters, and will often refuse to agree to, or even consider, other people's opinions.
