An agar plate is a Petri dish that contains agar and some nutrients. It is used to culture microorganisms. For example, a blood sample of a patient may be cultured on agar plate, to let the bacteria which has made him ill to grow; these bacteria can then be idenfitified using a microsope to let the doctor choose the approrpiate treatment of the patient.
When microorganisms grow on the agar plate, they form colonies. Each colony has similar genetic characteristics.
