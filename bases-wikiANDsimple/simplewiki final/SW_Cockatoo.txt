Cockatoos are 21 species of birds that make up the family "Cacatuidae". They come from Australia and the East Indies. The upper jaw of the bill overlaps the narrow lower jaw.
The cockatoo builds its nest in a high tree hole in the tropical forest. The female lays two white eggs on wood chips. The young, which hatch naked and blind are fed by the adults by regurgitation of partially digested food for about three months. Cockatoos often travel in immense flocks numbering many thousands. They make good pets and are found in all zoos Cockatoos come in all different colours, but the most common is white.
