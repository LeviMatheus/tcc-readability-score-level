Cassiniâ€“Huygens is a robotic spacecraft mission made together by NASA/ESA/ASI, that is now studying the planet Saturn and its moons. The spacecraft has two main parts: the NASA Cassini orbiter, named after the Italian-French astronomer Giovanni Domenico Cassini, and the ESA Huygens probe, named after the Dutch astronomer, mathematician, and physicist Christiaan Huygens. It was launched on October 15, 1997 and entered into orbit around Saturn on July 1, 2004. On December 25 2004 the Huygens probe separated from the orbiter at more or less 02:00 UTC. The probe landed on Saturn's moon Titan on January 14 2005, where it descended and started sending information for the scientists to study. It is the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn and the fourth spacecraft to visit Saturn.
