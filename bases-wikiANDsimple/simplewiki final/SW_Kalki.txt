Kalki is the final avatar or incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu. Hindus believe that there are four stages of time. The stage of time we are in is called the Kali Yurga. In this stage of time, people become bad. To make the world good, Kalki will come to Earth, and will destroy the bad things and stop the bad people. People will change then, and become good people. A new stage of time will begin, called the Satya Yurga or the first stage of life.
