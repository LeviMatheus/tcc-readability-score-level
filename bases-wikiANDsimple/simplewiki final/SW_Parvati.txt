According to Hinduism and Hindu mythology, Parvati is the wife of Shiva. Shiva is one of the main gods of the Hindu religion. Parvati is a word in the Sanskrit language that means daughter of the mountain. Hindu teachings call Parvati the daughter of the Himalayas Mountains, where she is said to live. She has two sons, Ganesha and Kartikeya.
When shown alone, Parvati has four arms. In her arms she carries prayer beads, a mirror, a bell and citron. But when she sits by the side of her husband Shiva, Parvati has only two arms.
Parvati's conveyance (vahana) is a lion or tiger. This means that Parvati rides a lion or a tiger.
