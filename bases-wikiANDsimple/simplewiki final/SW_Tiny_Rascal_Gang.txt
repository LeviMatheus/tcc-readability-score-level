The Tiny Rascal Gang (TRG) is an Asian criminal gang created in California during the middle of the 1980s. It was formed by Cambodian gang members. It is presently believed to be the largest Asian street gang in the United States.
History.
The Tiny Rascal Gang began in Long Beach. There is some disagreement about how the name was chosen. The gang was set up in Long Beach in the early 1980s by Cambodian immigrants.
At first, the gang's main goal was to protect Cambodians from other gangs of Long Beach. The members of these gangs were mostly Mexicans and African Americans. For this reason, the gang allowed only Cambodians to join at first. They later allowed other Asian Americans to join as well.
Many Tiny Rascal Gang members from the Long Beach area have been deported either because of their illegal status in the United States, or for crimes as non citizens, or both. Because of these deportations, members of TRG have recruited more members in their home countries. The "Los Angeles Times" says that deportation policies have had an effect on the size and influence of the gang both in the United States and in Cambodia. Cambodian authorities report that about 60% of people in prison for gang related crimes have either fled prosecution or been deported from the United States of America.
Enemies.
The gangs enemies are The East Side Longo, Asian Boyz, Vietnamese Boyz, Mara Salvatrucha, Toonerville Rifa 13, and Bloods. Tiny Rascal Gang has a history of very bad violence and murder against enemy street gangs and the police.
