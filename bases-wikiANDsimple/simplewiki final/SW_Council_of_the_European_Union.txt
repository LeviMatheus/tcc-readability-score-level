The Council of the European Union is one of the three organisations that manage the European Union. Along with the European Parliament, it is responsible for law making for the European Union (EU).
Its members are the government ministers of the member countries who are responsible for the law that is being discussed. As an example, suppose the law is going to be about farming, then the Agriculture Ministers are the Council for that day.
As well as making laws, they can meet to discuss their problems. For example, the European Union does not decide on tax - each country decides on its own tax. But the Finance Ministers meet anyway because sometimes they can help each other catch people who do not want to pay tax.
The Council is called different things in different countries, according to the language they speak. In (French it is "Le Conseil de l'Union Européenne", in German it is "Rat der Europäischen Union", in Czech it is "Rada Evropské unie".
