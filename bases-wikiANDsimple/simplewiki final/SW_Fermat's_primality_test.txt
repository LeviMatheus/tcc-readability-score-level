Fermat's primality test is an algorithm. It is a recipe for computers. It can test if a given number "p" is probably prime. There is a flaw however: There are numbers that pass the test, and that are not prime.
Concept.
Fermat's little theorem states that if "p" is prime and formula_1, then
If we want to test if "n" is prime, then we can pick random "as in the interval and see if the equation above holds. If the equality does not hold for a value of "a", then "n" is composite (not prime). If the equality does hold for many values of "a", then we can say that "n" is probably prime, or a pseudoprime.
It may be in our tests that we do not pick any value for "a" such that the equality fails. Any "a" such that
when "n" is composite is known as a "Fermat liar". If we do pick an "a" such that
then "a" is known as a "Fermat witness" for the compositeness of "n".
"formula_5" is the modulo operation. Its result is what remains, if p is divided by n. As an example,
What this test is used for.
The RSA algorithm for public-key encryption can be done in such a way that it uses this test. This is useful in cryptography
