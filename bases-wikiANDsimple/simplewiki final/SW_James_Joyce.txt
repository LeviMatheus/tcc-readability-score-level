James Augustine Aloysius Joyce () (February 2, 1882 - January 13, 1941) was a famous Irish writer and poet of the modernist movement. He was from Dublin, Ireland. He was famous for his eyepatch, which he wore because of eye damage. He could not see well.
His books are written in a special style. At first he wrote in a way which describes very accurately how life is, in the short story collection called "Dubliners". In his next book, called "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man", he started a new style. It is called stream of consciousness, and influenced many other writers in the 20th century.
Joyce met Nora Barnacle in 1904 and they began to have a long relationship until his death in 1941. The two moved out of Dublin to Zürich in 1904, then to Trieste, Paris then back to Zürich. They married in 1931. They had a son and a daughter, although their daughter had a mental illness later in her life.
Joyce became a very famous writer after he published "Ulysses". He also began to have a lot of problems with his eye and his family. But he still completed his last book, "Finnegans Wake" by 1939. It is a very difficult book.
