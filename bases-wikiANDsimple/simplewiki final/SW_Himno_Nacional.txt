Himno Nacional (in English: "National Anthem") is the national anthem of the Dominican Republic. The music was written by Jos√© Reyes (1835-1905) and the lyrics (words of the song) by Emilio Prud'homme (1856-1932).
This anthem was played for the first time on 17 August 1883 in Santo Domingo. In 1897, Prud'homme made some corrections to its original poem.
"Himno Nacional" was made the official Dominican national anthem on 30 May 1934.
