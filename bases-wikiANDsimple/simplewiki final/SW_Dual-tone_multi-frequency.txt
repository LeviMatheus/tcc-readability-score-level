Dual-tone multi-frequency (DMTF) is a way to use in-band signalling on analog lines. It is still widely used to transmit phone numbers from the telephone to the network. DMTF largely replaced the older Pulse dialling. Pulse dialling sends one impulse, per number. To transmit the number 9, 9 impulses are necessary. DMTF uses a different frequency for each number. This is faster than the older pulse dialling.
In addition to the numbers 0-9, the star (*), hash mark (#) and the letters "A" to "D" also have frequencies. * and # are used to issue commands. Digital systems like ISDN or Voice over IP use out-of band signallng.
