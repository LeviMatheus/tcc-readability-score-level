The 36th Ryder Cup Matches were held between September 22 and September 24, 2006 at The K Club, Straffan, Co. Kildare, Ireland. Team Europe won the competition by a score of 18½ to 9½, equalling their record winning margin of 2 years earlier. This was the first time Europe had achieved three successive victories. Swedish rookie Henrik Stenson made the winning putt, just moments after Luke Donald had sunk a putt to ensure Europe retained the trophy.
