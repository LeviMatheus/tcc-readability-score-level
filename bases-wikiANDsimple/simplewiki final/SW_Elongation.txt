Elongation is an astronomical term that describes the angle between the Sun and a planet, as viewed from Earth.
When an inferior planet is visible after sunset, it is near its greatest eastern elongation. When an inferior planet is visible before sunrise, it is near its greatest western elongation. The value of the greatest elongation (west or east), for Mercury, is between 18째 and 28째; and for Venus between 45째 and 47째. This value varies because the orbits of the planets are elliptical, rather than perfect circles.
