Gatwick Express is the name given to the frequent rail shuttle service between Victoria station in London and Gatwick Airport in South East England. Until June 2008, Gatwick Express was a separate train operating company (TOC) owned by Southern, that operated the separate Gatwick Express franchise. Both the TOC and the franchise were axed on 22 June 2008, when the service was transferred to Southern.
