The Lieutenancies Act 1997 (1997 c. 23) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom.
A Lord Lieutenant is the Queen's representative in a county or other area.
The Lieutenancies Act sets out the areas in which Lords-Lieutenant work in Great Britain. It came into force on 1 July 1997.
These areas are usually called "ceremonial counties" or "preserved counties" in Wales. In Scotland a Statutory Instrument (rule written by a minister) defines the size of the lieutenancy. They are usually one local council area, but some council areas are too small or to large for one Lord Lieutenant.
