A drum is a musical instrument that is struck with the hands or with a drum stick (a stick for hitting a drum). A collection of drums and cymbals is called a drum kit, or drum set.
It is used to keep a steady beat in a song. It is also used in many kinds of music to give the music a sense of feeling. For example, if you wanted a song to be slow, the drums play slower, and the same goes for if you want the song to be fast.
A drum is a percussion instrument, which means it makes a noise by being hit. There are many types of percussion such as cymbals and cowbells and even a simple piece of wood can be considered percussion.
