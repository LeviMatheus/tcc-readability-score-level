A serve (sometimes called a service) in tennis is a shot to start a point. The serve is usually started by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it (usually near the top of its path in the air) into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. It may be performed underhand or overhead. The serve is the only shot where a player can take his time to set up, instead of having to react to an opponent's shot.
