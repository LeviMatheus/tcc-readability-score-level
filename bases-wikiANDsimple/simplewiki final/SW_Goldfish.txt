Goldfish are pet fish that live in bowls or aquariums.
Goldfish belong to the Carp family, and were domesticated in China in the 17th century. They can reach up to 59 cm in size, and 3 kg in weight. This is very rare though, and most goldfish grow to half that size. In captivity, goldfish can live for up to 20 years. In the aquarium or fishtank, however, most will die earlier because their tank is much too small. Goldfish need a lot of space so they have room to swim and so the water does not get dirty too fast. It is also said that goldfish have very short memories, but people have proved that this is not true. One person trained a goldfish to kick a small ball under water and another trained a goldfish to swim through a maze.
There are many kinds of goldfish. The most common kind is golden-colored, but goldfish come in lots of different shapes and sizes. Another common kind is called a black moor, which is black colored.
Goldfish are very sensitive and should not be alerted.
