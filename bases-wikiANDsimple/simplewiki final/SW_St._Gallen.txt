St. Gallen is a city in the eastern part of Switzerland. It is located near the Lake of Constance. St. Gallen is the capital of th canton of St. Gallen. The city was founded as a monastery by the Irish monk Gallus in the 7th century. In the Middle Ages a city grew around the monastery. The role of the monastery (and the city) was very important in the Middle Ages. One of the three remaining manuscripts of the "Nibelungenlied" are from the monastery of St.Gallen. Today, the monastery, with its library, and parts of the old town are classed as an UNESCO World Heritage site.
The city is about 675 meters above sea level and is located in a part of Switzerland with many hills. As of 2004, about 70.000 people lived in the city. The urban area has about 100.000 to 120.000 people.
In the 18th and 19th century the city became known for its embroideries, which are still very well-known. Every four years, there is the "St.Galler Kinderfest" (Childrens festval). This is a large representation of the primary (and some secondary) schools in the city. Its usually in early summer.
The city also has an university, which is known for its courses in economics, and (to a lesser extent), law.
In Switzerland, the city is also known for "St.Galler Bratwurst", and a fair centered around agriculture, held once a year, in autumn. That fair is called OLMA (Ostschweitzerische Landwitschaftsmaschinenaustellung", roughly translates to "Exhibition of agricultural machinery of eastern Switzerland").
In early summer there is also an open-air rock festival. Its called Open-Air St.Gallen, and held in a valley, near the river. Since the weather is not always as good, in many years its a battle with the mud.
