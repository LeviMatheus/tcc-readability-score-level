A trumpet is a brass instrument used mainly in Classical music and jazz music. The most common type of trumpet is a B"b" trumpet, meaning that if the player plays a C, it will sound like a B"b" in concert pitch. The trumpet is played by blowing into the mouthpiece and making a "buzzing" sound. There are three keys called valves that the player can press to change the pitch.
History.
Almost 3500 years ago, people would blow on shells and animal horns as a signal. These shells were prepared after killing the animal, therefore making a sound instead of a "fffff" rushing air sound. An early example of a brass instrument like a trumpet is called a shofar, which is still used in religious ceremonies. Eventually people started making trumpet-like instruments with wood (for example, the cornetto), and later, with brass.
Many years ago, when the use of instrumental music was growing, trumpets became very important. Trumpets were long and without valves. This meant a player had to control the pitch of the sound with only his mouth, which was very difficult. Everyone respected trumpet players because trumpets were just so difficult to play.
The chromatic trumpet was developed in the late 18th century. Later on, valves were developed, and it became easier to play notes on the trumpet. Still, trumpet is a difficult instrument to master.
