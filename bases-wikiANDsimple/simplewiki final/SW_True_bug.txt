The true bugs are an order (a group) of insects. Scientists call true bugs the Hemiptera. There are around 80,000 species (different kinds) of true bugs. The word "bug" by itself can have other meanings.
There are many different kinds of true bugs, some of which are aphids, cicadas, planthoppers, shield bugs, and others. All of these are true bugs. Their size is from 1 mm to over 10 cm. All true bugs have similar mouthparts, which is what characterizes the true bugs (the kind of mouth they have makes a true bug a true bug).
Features of true bugs.
The feature that defines the Hemiptera is that they have piercing, sucking mouthparts. They pierce food with their long, tube-like mouth, called a proboscis or a beak. They can not chew. The true bug pumps saliva through this mouth, to partly digest their food. The bug then sucks up the food, which has been turned into a liquid by their saliva.
The name "Hemiptera" is from the Greek language and means "hemi" (half) and "pteron" (wing). Many true bugs have half of their front wings hardened and have the other half soft. These wings are called "hemelytra" (singular "hemelytron"), because they halfway look like the hard wings (elytra) of beetles. The hind wings are totally soft and are shorter than the front wings.
The antennae of true bugs usually have five segments. The tarsi (foot parts) of the legs have three or less segments.
