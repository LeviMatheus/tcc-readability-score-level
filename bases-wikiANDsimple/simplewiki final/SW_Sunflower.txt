The sunflower ("Helianthus annuus") is an annual plant in the family Asteraceae, with a large flower head (inflorescence). The stem of the flower can grow up to 3 metres tall, with a flower head that can be 30 cm wide.
Birds and other animals enjoy eating sunflower seeds. Humans like to eat them too, although not all kinds, and usually they are coated with chocolate. Other types of sunflowers include the California Royal Sunflower, which has a burgandy (red + purple) flower head.
