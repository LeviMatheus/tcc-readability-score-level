A Hall of Fame is a type of museum for awards in certain areas where awards can be given, for example sport, art, theatre, music, agriculture, military and many more areas. A Hall of Fame is sometimes an actual building where awards, trophies and memrobilia are stored but sometimes a Hall of Fame is just a list of award winners. To get into a Hall of Fame in any area one must be the best in that area, or one of the best.
