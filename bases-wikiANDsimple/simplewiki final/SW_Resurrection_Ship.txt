The Cylon Resurrection Ship is a fictional type of spacecraft found in the television series "Battlestar Galactica". The ship is a part of Cylon Fleet.
Cylons who are killed have their consciousness downloaded into a nearby resurrection ship. A new body is created for their consciousness. This lets them live again after they die. If a cylon is too far away from the nearest resurrection ship, death will be permanent. With nowhere for the consciousness to download to, they will simply cease to exist.
