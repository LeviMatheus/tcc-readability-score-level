"Goosebumps" is a collection of children's horror fiction books written by R. L. Stine.
The Goosebumps series sometimes contained too much violence, so some American libraries disagreed with having the books there; the novels were fifteenth on the American Library Association's list of most frequently challenged books from 1990 to 1999.
After the series, many different spinoffs were made, also written by Stine, including "Give Yourself Goosebumps" and "Goosebumps: Series 2000" which appeared in 1995 and 1998.
Two board games were created after the "Goosebumps" series, these were called "Terror in the Graveyard" and "Escape from Horrorland". a 1996 PC game was also produced, entitled "Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland".
Front covers and most other Goosebumps-related art was done by artist Tim Jacobus, while the covers for the later "Give Yourself Goosebumps" series were digitally created by Craig White.
