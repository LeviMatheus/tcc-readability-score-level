Camping is a leisure activity where people leave their homes and spend one or more nights outdoors, usually to enjoy nature or a different environment. Usually they will sleep in a tent, or may not need to use one if the weather is warm. In some parts of the world, tents are people's homes.
When camping, people usually prepare food to eat that is easy to make. If they were hunting or fishing, they may cook the animal or fish they caught over a campfire.
