Herman's Hermits were a rock band from England. They were part of the "British Invasion" of bands during the 1960s, and were most popular in that decade. Their business manager was an American named Allen Klein, who also worked for Donovan, The Animals, and later The Rolling Stones and The Beatles.
None of the members was really named Herman. Lead singer Peter Noone (pronounced "noon") was nicknamed Herman, because his bandmates thought he looked like Sherman, from "The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show". Noone was an actor before he became a singer. The other band members were Derek "Lek" Leckenby (guitar), Keith Hopwood (guitar, keyboards), Karl Green (bass guitar) and Barry Whitwam (drums). The band began as amateurs, playing at parties for friends, but turned professional as they improved. They made records, appeared on television, and also made movies.
The Hermits's hit records included "I'm Into Something Good", "Can't You Hear My Heartbeat?", "There's A Kind Of Hush (All Over The World)", "I'm Henry VIII, I Am", "Listen People", and cover versions of "Silhouettes", "Sea Cruise", and "The End Of The World". "Hold On" was the title song of their first movie. "Mrs. Brown, You've Got A Lovely Daughter" was a hit song first, that was later fitted to a movie storyline.
Herman's Hermits stopped having hits as music trends changed, but their old songs were well loved. They are still played today. The band members went on to other careers in the 1970s. Peter Noone went back to acting, but still appeared as a singer.
In the 1980s, Leckenby and Whitwam formed a new band, to tour under the old name. The singer sounded like Noone, and many fans did not know the difference. Other original members also sometimes rejoined. During the 1990s, Noone took over the name for his band, that appeared with him at oldies concerts.
