A lawyer (or in some countries called an "Advocate", "attorney", "Barrister", "counsel", "counsellor", or "Solicitor") is someone who studied law and got a degree in that discipline. If people have a problem with law, or with someone else, they might go to a lawyer to get legal advice. If the case goes to court, the lawyer will then represent those people, either defending the person because someone else has started a legal case or arguing a case that the person has started. When a person is accused of a crime the person has a defence lawyer to try and show they have not committed a crime. The lawyer arguing that they did do the crime is called the "prosecutor".
He or she might also help to prepare legal documents for those people (this is one of things real estate lawyers do), or give (legally binding witness) that some event took place (like the signing of a contract).
Lawyers work in different settings. Some work by themselves, while some work in big law firms. Some lawyers work for hospitals and private companies
Of course there will be fees for the different services offered, unless the work is done for free, which is called pro bono.
