Shams-ud-din Iltutmish (died 1236) was the third Muslim Turkic sultan of the Sultanate of Delhi and the third ruler of the Mamlukdynasty (or Slave dynasty). He was the son-in-law of Qutb-ud-din Aibak. He came to the throne after defeating Qutb-ud-din's son. He is said to be the greatest ruler of the Mamluk dynasty. He belonged to the Ilebar tribe. The first thing he did after becoming a sultan was expand his kingdom. He had to defend his empire against Mongol invasions and had to deal with Rajputs. Iltutmish prevented the Mongol attack in 1221 A.D led by Chenghiz Khan. He completed the Qutb Minar started by Qutb-ud-din Aibak. He also built the Quwat-ul-Islam mosque in Delhi.He died in 1236 A.D,the same year that Khwaja Gharib Nawaz, the sufi saint died. He did not consider his sons worthy of the throne and so he nominated his daughter, Sultana Razia, as the next ruler of Delhi.
