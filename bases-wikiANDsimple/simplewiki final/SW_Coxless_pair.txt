In rowing, a coxless pair consists of a pair of rowers, each having one oar, one on the stroke side (rower's right hand side) and one on the bow side (rower's lefthand side). As the name suggests, there is no cox on such a boat, and the two rowers must co-ordinate steering and the proper timing of oar strokes between themselves.
