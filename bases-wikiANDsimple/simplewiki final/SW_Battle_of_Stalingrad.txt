The Battle of Stalingrad is a name used by most people in English sources for several large battles by Germany and its friends and Soviet forces conducted with the purpose of owning the city of "Stalingrad", which took place between 17 July 1942 and February 2 1943, during the Second World War. Because of its good location leading to the Caucasus and its name, Adolf Hitler sent a lot of people to fight in this Russian city. 1.6 million casualties were reported in battle in total, with more Russian deaths, but it was a good moral victory for the Russians. After the battle, the city was all blown up.
Stalingrad was known as "Tsaritsyn" until 1925 and as "Volgograd" since 1961.
