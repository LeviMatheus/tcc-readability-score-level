Lincoln Thompson (June 18, 1949 - January 23, 1999) was a Jamaican reggae musician, songwriter and Rastafarian. He spent 2 years in the Tartans as a teenager before working under Coxsone Dodd in the early 1970s. In 1974 he released his first record, "Humanity". While it produced hit singles it was not given commercial exposure until Thompson made a deal with Ballistics, a subsidiary of United Artists, in 1979. This album was released commercially and there were 2 follow-up albums that he recorded in 1979 and 1980. "Experience" was recorded in Jamaica, while the follow up "Natural Wild" was recorded in England with Joe Jackson. Ballistics went bankrupt, but Thompson was able to salvage enough to return to Jamaica, where he recorded a further album, "Ride with the Rasses" in 1982. The following year he took his family to live in London where he recorded a 5th album, "Rootsman Blues". He then set up an Ital food grocery shop in London. Thanks to an American sponsor a 6th album came out in 1996, called "21st century". He died of cancer.
