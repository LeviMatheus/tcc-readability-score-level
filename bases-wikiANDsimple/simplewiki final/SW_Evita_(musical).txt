Evita is a musical written by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the life of Eva Peron (1919-1952), the wife of Argentine President Juan Peron.
The show was originally written in 1976 when a double album was released featuring Julie Covington, Colm Wilkinson, Paul Jones and Barbara Dickson. In 1978, the original London production was mounted with Elaine Paige as Eva, David Essex as Che and Joss Ackland as Peron.
A film version of the show was made in 1996 starring Madonna in the title role, with Antonio Banderas as Che and Jonathan Pryce as Peron.
