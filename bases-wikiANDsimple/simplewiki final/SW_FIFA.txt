The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (French for International Federation of Association Football), or FIFA for short, is the organization that controls international football (also called "association football"). The organization’s main buildings are in Zürich, Switzerland, and right now the president is Sepp Blatter. FIFA organizes major international football tournaments, and the most famous one is the FIFA World Cup, which has been held since 1930. FIFA was established on May 21, 1904 in Paris and has 208 national associations as its members. The organization’s official languages are English, French, German and Spanish.
The most powerful organ of FIFA is the FIFA Congress, which is an assembly made up of representatives from each member association. The Congress holds a regular meeting once a year, and since 1998 an additional meeting has been held every year. Only the Congress can pass changes to FIFA's laws.
The Congress decides whether FIFA should accept new national associations and elects the President of FIFA, its General Secretary and the other members of FIFA's Executive Committee. The President and General Secretary take care of what goes on within and around FIFA. The Executive Committee, with the President as its head, is resposible for deciding the dates, locations and format of tournaments.
Also, there are six regional confederations recognized by FIFA which take care of the game in the six different continents of the world. National associations must be members of both FIFA and their regional confederation in order for their teams to compete in FIFA's competitions. The six confederations are AFC (Asian Football Confederation in Asia and Australia), CAF (Confédération Africaine de Football in Africa), CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football in North America and Central America), CONMEBOL (Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol in South America), OFC (Oceania Football Confederation in Oceania) and UEFA (Union Européenne de Football Association in Europe).
