The Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar. It brings some things from a lunar calendar with some from a solar calendar. Today in China the Gregorian calendar is used for most activities. The Chinese calendar is still used for traditional Chinese holidays like Chinese New Year, Duan Wu festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is also used to determine the phases of the moon. This is because one month is one cycle of the moon.
