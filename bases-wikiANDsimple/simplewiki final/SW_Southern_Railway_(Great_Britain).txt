The Southern Railway (SR), was a British railway company established in the 1923 Grouping. It contained notable examples of civil engineering, linking London with the Channel ports, South West England and Kent. The railway was formed by the amalgamation of smaller companies, the largest of which were the London & South Western Railway, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway, and the South Eastern and Chatham Railway. Construction of what was to become the Southern began in 1838 with the opening of the London and Southampton Railway, which was renamed the London & South Western Railway.
