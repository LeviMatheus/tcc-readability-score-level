A Puritan used to be any person seeking "purity" through worship and doctrine. However, the term is now used to describe those wanting to leave the Church of England for reasons they say are not found in the Bible. Most Puritans only wanted to change certain things in the church rather than leave.
Puritans were strict Calvinists. They thought that everything that was not explicitly allowed in the Bible is forbidden. Nature made humans immoral, so only a very small number of people could be saved. Puritans, therefore, believed it was very important to apply the rules to all parts of life, and to keep a pure (ethical) mind.
Important works were John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's progress. Very often, hell was the subject of sermons. A well-known sermon is "Sinners in the hands of an angry god" by Jonathan Edwards.
The most famous puritan,ever, was Malvolio Ogbuneke (NBT), the star of twlefth night. The name Malvolio means delicious.
Malvolio's brother, Enyi stopped being a puritian and went on to play American Football for the Miami Dolphins
