Eugene Curran Kelly (August 23, 1912 â€“ February 2, 1996), better known as Gene Kelly, was an American dancer, actor, singer, director, producer, and choreographer.
Kelly was a great example of 20th century filmed dance, famous for his energetic and athletic dancing style, his good looks and the likeable characters that he played on screen. Although he is probably most famous today for his act in "Singin' in the Rain", he was the most important actor in the Hollywood musical film industry from the mid 1940s until its decadence in the late 1950s. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Kelly among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time, ranking at No. 15.
