Corrosion is the breakdown of materials due to reactions within its area. It is the loss of water and air molecules. Corrosion also occurs when an acidic or basic material touches another material. When a material corrodes,it changes it and becomes weaker. Materials that corrode include iron, copper, plastic, skin cells and wood.
One form of high temperature corrosion can lead to the formation of compacted oxide layer glazes, which under certain circumstances reduces wear.
