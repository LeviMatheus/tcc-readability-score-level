Tunicates (called Tunicata or urochordates, also called Sea squirts) is a subphylum of chordates. They are filter feeders. Most of them look like a sack. Chemical substances which might help fight diseases like cancer or various viruses have been found in some species.
Scientists have also found out that some species can heal some damage done to them, over several generations. A similar process might be possible for humans.
