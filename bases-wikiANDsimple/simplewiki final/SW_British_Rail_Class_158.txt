British Rail Class 158 "Express Sprinter" is a diesel multiple unit (DMU) train, built for British Rail between 1989 and 1992 by BREL at their Derby Works. They were built to replace elderly 'heritage' DMUs and locomotive-hauled passenger trains. Class 159 trains are almost identical to Class 158s having been converted from Class 158 to Class 159 in two batches.
