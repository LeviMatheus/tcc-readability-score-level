The Kassites (Persian: کاسی‌ها) were an ancient people from Zagros mountains. Kassites were a federation of several nomadic tribes living in the Zagros mountains, in modern Loristan (Iran).
In the 18th century BCE, the Kassites started to infiltrate Mesopotamia, which was ruled by the successors of the famous king Hammurabi of Babylon (1792-1750). Kassites threatened Babylonia, which they captured 1750 BCE.
The Kassite dynasty of Babylon dominated southern Mesopotamia until the 12th century BCE.
