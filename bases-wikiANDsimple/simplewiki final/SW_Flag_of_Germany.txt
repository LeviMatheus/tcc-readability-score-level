The flag of Germany (German: "Bundesflagge") was adopted in its present form in 1919. It was readopted with the new constitution of 1949. It has three colours and is made of three equal horizontal bands coloured black (top), red, and gold (bottom).
The "Dienstflagge" or service flag is the version of the flag for government use. It has the national coat of arms in the centre. Ships of the German Navy use this flag with a triangle cut out of the end as an ensign
Some states use the national flag with the state coat of arms as a state flag
