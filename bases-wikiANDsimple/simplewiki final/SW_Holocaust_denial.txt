Holocaust denial is the belief that The Holocaust (the killing of millions of Jews and others during World War II by the Nazis) did not happen, or happened on a smaller scale.
Most history experts agree that the Nazis did kill millions of people in concentration camps. However, people who deny the Holocaust, who prefer to call themselves "Holocaust revisionists" say that the Holocaust is the product of a conspiracy (many people have joined together to produce lies told for a reason or purpose).
Arguing over how many people died in the Holocaust stops us from thinking about the fact that people were mass murdered. It is the fact of mass murder by the Nazis, and not the exact number of their victims, which is important.
It is against the law to deny the Holocaust in a number of European countries, especially in Germany. Ernst ZÃ¼ndel is a well known Holocaust-denier, he faces prosecution in Germany for it.
