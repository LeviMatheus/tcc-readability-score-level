Popeye the Sailor is one of the most popular cartoon characters of all time. He first appeared in a comic strip called "Thimble Theatre" by EC Segar in 1929. Popeye is a sailor who smokes a pipe and mutters things under his breath. He has only one eye, he is short and uneducated, but when trouble occurs, usually saving his girlfriend, Olive Oyl from his arch-nemesis, Bluto/Brutus, he eats a can of spinach, and gets super-strength. He also appeared in a series of cartoons made for movie theatres by Paramount Pictures, which is what he is best known for.
