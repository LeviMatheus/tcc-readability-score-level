The Manchu people are a Tungusic people who came from Manchuria (today's Northeastern China). During their rise in the seventeenth century they conquered the Ming Dynasty and founded the Qing Dynasty, which ruled China until the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which established a republican government in its place.
The Manchu have largely been assimilated with the Han Chinese.
