A marching band is a group of instrumental musicians who generally perform outdoors.
It combines movement – usually some type of marching and other movements  – with their musical performance. Its instruments typically are brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments. The music usually has a strong rhythmic component suitable for marching. All marching bands use some kind of uniform.
In addition to traditional parade performances, many bands also perform field shows at special events (such as football games) or at competitions.
