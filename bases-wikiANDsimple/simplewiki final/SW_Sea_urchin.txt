Sea urchins are invertebrates that live in the sea. They belong to the same family of animals as the sea stars, sea cucumbers, brittle-stars and crinoids (perhaps better known as "sea lillies"). Sea urchins mostly feed on algae. Their thorns serve to protect them from predators. Stepping on them is quite painful but not dangerous.
Sea otters like to eat sea urchins very much. Some humans eat the reproductive organs of sea urchins (which they call roe). This is popular in Korea. In Japan, this kind of sushi is called "uni". People think it is an aphrodisiac. Sea urchins are well adapted and have very few enemies. Sea urchins are pretty small at 4 inches (10cm).
