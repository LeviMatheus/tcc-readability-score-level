A Bunsen burner is a common piece of laboratory equipment. It is commonly used for heating chemical substances, sterilization, and combustion, and it works by burning flammable gas. It is named after Robert Wilhelm Bunsen. Bunsen was a German chemist. Bunsen did not invent the burner, he simply made it better. Originally Michael Faraday developed the Bunsen burner. In 1547 there was another type of burner the same as the bunsen but it was called the butt burner.
