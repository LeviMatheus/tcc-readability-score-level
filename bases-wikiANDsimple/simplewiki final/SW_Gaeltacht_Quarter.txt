The Gaeltacht Quarter in Belfast, Northern Ireland, is an area around the Falls Road in the west of the city. A Gaeltacht is an area where the Irish language is most often spoken. The area aims to bring interest to the Irish language and tourist attractions related to it, as well as Irish culture.
Plans for a gaeltacht quarter in Belfast began in 2002, as a recommendation of the Joint West Belfast/Greater Shankill Task Force. The plan was then adopted by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and Belfast City Council.
Important areas and events in the quarter include the An Cúlturlann arts centre, Conway Mill and the Féile an Phobail.
