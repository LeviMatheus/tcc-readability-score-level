The theremin (originally pronounced but often anglicized as), (also thereminvox or aetherphone) is one of the earliest fully electronic musical instruments. It was invented by Russian inventor LÃ©on Theremin in 1919. It was the first musical instrument designed to be played without being touched. The control section has two metal antennas to sense the positions of the player's hands. One hand controls the pitch. The other hand controls the volume. To play the theremin, the player moves his hands around the two metal antennas. The electric signals from the theremin are amplified and sent to a loudspeaker.
The theremin is widely associated with "alien," surreal, and eerie-sounding portamento, glissando, tremolo, and vibrato sounds, due to its use in film soundtracks such as "Spellbound", "The Lost Weekend", "Ed Wood", "Mars Attacks!" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still". Theremins are also used in art music (especially avant-garde and 20th century "new music") and in popular music genres such as rock and pop.
