A computer mouse is used to tell a computer what to do, including moving the cursor and choosing things on the screen. It got its name because the wire coming out of the end of the first computer mice reminded people of the tail of a real mouse. Many mice today are wireless and run on batteries.
History.
When Silicon Valley was being reclaimed in California, Douglas Engelbart, a researcher of Stanford institute, put on his thinking cap while looking at a computer.
'Can we use a computer more conveniently?'
In those days, using a computer was very inconvenient because of its large size. Having studied for a long time, he succeeded in inventing an input device called 'XY index' at last. Originally it needed two hands to use, but it was developed gradually to be used by one hand. This is the mouse that we commonly use today.
It was used in earnest when the 'Macintosh' of Apple Inc. came out in 1984. And 'Windows' was being used widely as a OS (operating system) of a computer, so the mouse spread rapidly. Now it is fitted in 86% of all computers, and there are about 3 hundred million.
Uses.
On most computers, the user can move the mouse to move the cursor in the same direction. If there is something on the screen that the user wants to choose, he can move the cursor over it and click the left mouse button. The right mouse button is used to open menus that are different depending on where the cursor is. The other mouse buttons can do different things, depending on what software is being used. A mouse can have anywhere from 1 to 6 buttons to click, but most mice have two or three. Some mice also have a "scroll wheel" -- a small wheel found between the two main mouse buttons. The user can move the wheel up or down to "scroll" through things like a website or folder, which means to move it up or down on the screen, or he or she can click the wheel down like another button.
