The oak tree is a kind of hardwood forest tree. Oak trees come in many different kinds of species, but all of them have large seeds called acorns.
Oak trees grow all over many parts of Europe and North America. Many of the people who own wooded land in these parts of the world are very proud of their oak trees.
Some kinds of oak wood are very hard. A lot of furniture is made from oak wood.
Most oak trees lose all of their leaves in fall. A special kind of oak tree, the "live oak", grows in the American South. It is called the "live oak" because it keeps many of its leaves over the winter.
