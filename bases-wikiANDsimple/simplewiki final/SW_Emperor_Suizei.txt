Emperor Suizei was the second emperor of Japan.
Emperor Suizei was thought to have ruled Japan from 581 BC to 549 BC, but he is thought to be legendary. He was traditionally believed to have existed, but no studies show that he actually lived. It was said that he ruled from the palace of Takawoka, in Kadzuraki.
According to legend, he was the son of Emperor Jimmu.
Names.
His posthumous name, a name given after his death, means "joyfully healthy peace".
His personal name was "Kamu Nunagawamimi no Mikoto", but it would not be considered polite to call an emperor by this name.
