Nestorius (in Greek: "Νεστόριος"; "c." 386–"c." 451) was Archbishop of Constantinople from 10 April 428 to 22 June 431. His views were popular in the East.
History.
He was blamed by his political enemy, Cyril of Alexandria of Nestorianism, for objecting to the popular practice of calling the Virgin Mary the "Mother of God" theotokos. He was condemned at the Council of Ephesus before his supporters could arrive and he was then dethroned. The consequence of this was the creation of the Assyrian Church of the East, over the Persian border and far away from Greece.
