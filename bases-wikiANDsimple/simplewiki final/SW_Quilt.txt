A quilt is a type of blanket made of three layers: a top piece of cloth, a layer of insulating material often called "batting", and a bottom piece of cloth for backing. The layers are joined together either by sewing or by tying the layers together with pieces of yarn, thread, or ribbon.
The top layer of the quilt can be made from many pieces of cloth sewn together in patterns, known as "patchwork". Other patterns can be made by running lines of stitching through the three layers.
Sometimes quilts are not used as bedding, but are works of art made to be hung on a wall or used as decoration.
Quilting is done in many cultures, such as the Amish, in Hawaii, and in India.
