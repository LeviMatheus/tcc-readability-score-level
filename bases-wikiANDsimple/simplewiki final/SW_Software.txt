Software is short for computer software. It means the applications and operating systems used with computers. The term software was first used in the late 1960s to show the difference from computer hardware, which are the fixed parts of a machine. Before compact discs (CDs) or Internet downloads, applications and operating systems came on soft media like magnetic discs and magnetic tape. Software is an essential part of today's society. Basically software tells the hardware when to do a specific task.
The advancement of software is ever-changing and developers are creating different kinds programs to help businesses, corporates and everyone around the world. Gone are the days of filing information manually, with today's software everything is done in a fraction of the time.
