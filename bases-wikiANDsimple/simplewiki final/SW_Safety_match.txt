A safety match is a small device to make fire safely.
Typically it is a wooden stick (usually sold in match "boxes") or stiff paper stick (usually sold in match"books") coated at one end with a material, the match head, often containing the element phosphorus, that will ignite from the heat of friction if rubbed ("struck") against a suitable surface.
Matches are sold in tobacconists and other shops. Matches are rarely sold singularly; they are sold in multiples, packaged in either match boxes or in matchbooks.
