Traffic cones (also called road cones, safety cones, or pylons) are cone-shaped markers, generally made out of plastic, that are placed on roads to temporarily redirect automobile traffic in a safe manner.
Uses.
Traffic cones are often placed around construction sites or roadside accidents. As well, many utility companies such as telephone companies and electric companies place cones on the road when utility workers are working on or near the road. Cones are also used by driving schools to set up tests of turning and parking skills.
They have many other uses including bike training, fun and for personal use like reserving parking spaces.
Features.
Traffic cones are easily movable and about 60Â cm (24 inches) tall. Traffic cones come in many different colors, with orange, yellow and red being the most common colors. Many types of traffic cones have reflective strips or stripes of reflective paint, so that the cones are easier to see at night.
History.
Traffic cones were invented in 1914 by Charles P. Rudabaker. The first cones were made of concrete. In the 2000s, most cones are made of brightly-colored plastic.
