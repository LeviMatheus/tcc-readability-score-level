This was the final version of Hastings Restriction 0 diesel trains, classified 6B, later class 203. They were delivered in 1958 and consisted of units 1031-1037. They differed from class 202 by the substitution of a trailer buffet car for one of the three trailer second opens in all the earlier units. Their roofs were free of conduit like class 202's 1014-1019.
