A Cape Verde-type hurricane is an Atlantic hurricane that develops near the Cape Verde islands, off the west coast of Africa. The average hurricane season has about two Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which are usually the strongest storms of the season because they often have plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before coming across land.
