Rosa Louise McCauley Parks (February 4, 1913 â€“ October 24, 2005) was an African-American seamstress and civil rights activist. She was called the "Mother of the Modern-Day Civil Rights Movement ".
Parks is most famous for what she did on December 1, 1955. While she sat in a seat at the front of a bus, the bus driver told her to move to the back of the bus so a white passenger could take the seat in the front of the bus. Parks refused to move. She was tired of being treated as a lower class person because of the color of her skin. She was arrested. This led to the Montgomery bus boycott. After that, black people could sit wherever they wanted to on the bus. Her refusing to let others treat her differently was an important symbol in the fight for equal rights. She is an idol to blacks and women alike. She did not let the color of her skin get in the way of her rights as a human being.
