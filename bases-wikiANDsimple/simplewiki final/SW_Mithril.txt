"Mithril" is a fictional metal from J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth universe.
"Mithril" is the strongest metal known in Middle-earth. It looks similar to silver. It does not weigh much, and it is easy to make into things. "Mithril" is very rare and precious. It was only found in Khazad-dûm (Moria), where it was mined by the Dwarves, and (perhaps) in Númenor.
The name "mithril" comes from the Sindarin words "mith", meaning "grey", and "ril" meaning "glitter". In Quenya, its name is "mistarille". "Mithril" was also called "true-silver" or "Moria-silver".
The most well known object made of "mithril" is probably the mail shirt of Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.
Influence on other fiction.
"Mithril" is now often used in other fictional works, usually as a strong and magical metal. It other fictional works, "mithril" it is also sometimes written differently, for example as "mythril" or "mithral".
