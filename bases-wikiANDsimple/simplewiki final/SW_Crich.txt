Crich ("kryech") is a village in the English county of Derbyshire. It is the home of the National Tramway Museum in the Crich Tramway Village.
Memorial Tower.
At the top of Crich Hill is a Memorial Tower. The tower was built to remember members of the Sherwood Foresters regiment who died in battle, particularly in World War I.
The tower was built in 1923 on the site of an older tower called Crich Stand. The Memorial Tower is the end of an annual pilgrimage on the first Sunday in July. It is above sea level. The tower has 52 steps to the top. From the top of the tower, eight counties and landmarks such as the Humber Bridge and Lincoln Cathedral can be seen.

A workhouse was opened in 1734 at the edge of Nether Common. Forty people can live there. The workhouse accepted paupers from other parishes, including Melbourne, Pentrich, Willington, Mercaston and Denby.
The ITV drama series "Peak Practice" was filmed in the village, along with Ashover for a time. Crich is home to 'The Briars', a residential youth centre for the Catholic Diocese of Nottingham. The 2007 movie "And When Did You Last See Your Father" starring Colin Firth also has image of the village. In the film Firth is seen riding a motorbike up Chapel Lane.
