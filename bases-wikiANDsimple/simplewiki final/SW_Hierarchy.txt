A hierarchy (in Greek: Ιεραρχία; this comes from "ιερός"-hieros, sacred, and "άρχω"-arkho, rule) is a way of ranking and organizing things or people. Beneath the top of the hierarchy, each part of it is below some other part.
This turns out to be like a pyramid. There is a single person or thing at the top level.
An example with people would be the structure of a company. There is the top manager, and there are a few levels of middle and lower management. At the bottom are the common workers. Another example would be an army that might have a general, followed by colonels, corporals, and sergeants, then privates.
In these examples, people who are higher up have more authority and power than people below them.
