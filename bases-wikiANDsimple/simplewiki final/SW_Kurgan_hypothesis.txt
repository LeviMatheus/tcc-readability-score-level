The Kurgan model of Indo-European origins is on both archaeology and linguistics to show detailed archaeological cultures with different stages of the Indo-European expansion.
Background.
When it was first suggested in 1956, Marija Gimbutas's answer to the question of Indo-European origins was a pioneering interdisciplinary synthesis of archaeology and linguistics. From the nineties on, new archaeological evidence from Northern European prehistoric cultures was put forward to say the influence and expansion of Kurgan cultures to the west, and the process of "kurganization" of Corded Ware culture.
