Playground slides are slides for children to play on in playgrounds. The child climbs up a ladder or some stairs, then sits down at the top and slides all the way down. Some children like to slide down on their backs or on their stomachs. This can sometimes be dangerous on big slides.
Slides are made of metal or wood. They must have a smooth surface so that the child does not hurt himself. Sometimes, in amusement parks, there are giant slides called "helterskelters".
There are slides at swimming pools where people can slide down into the water with a splash. These are called "water slides" or "shutes".
