Dependent areas are territories and overseas territories that do not possess full independence or sovereignty as states/countries. There are varying degrees and forms of such a dependence. They are commonly distinguished from subnational entities in that they are not considered to be part of the motherland or mainland of the governing state, and in most cases they also represent a different order of separation. A subnational entity typically represents a division of the country proper, while a dependent territory might be an overseas territory that enjoys a greater degree of autonomy. For instance, many of them have a more or less separate legal system from the governing body.
The areas separately referred to as "non-independent" are territories that are disputed, are occupied, have a government in exile or have a non-negligible independence movement.
