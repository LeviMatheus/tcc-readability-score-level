"Listeria" is a Gram-positive rod which is not capable of forming endospores. Although several species of this bacterium exist, our discussion will focus only on the two species of human pathogenic significance: "L. monocytogenes" and L. ivanovii. In particular, "L. monocytogenes" has been implicated in several food poisoning epidemics.
Listeria are very common, they occur almost everywhere. Some Listeria are pathogens, they can cause a disease called Listeriosis. Listeriosis is usually caused by food gone bad.
