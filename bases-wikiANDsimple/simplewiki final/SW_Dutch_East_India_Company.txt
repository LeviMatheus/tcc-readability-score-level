The Dutch East India Company ("Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie" or VOC in old Dutch), started in 1602, when the Netherlands gave it a 21-year monopoly to trade in Asia. It was the first multinational corporation in the world and the first company to issue stock. The VOC had the power to start wars, make treaties, make its own money, and start new colonies.
It was an important company for almost 200 years, until it became bankrupt in 1800. The VOC's colonies became the Dutch East Indies and later became Indonesia.
