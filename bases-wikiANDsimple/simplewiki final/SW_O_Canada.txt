O Canada is the national anthem of Canada.
Calixa Lavallée wrote the music; Adolphe-Basile Routhier wrote the words in French. It was first sung in French in 1880. Robert Stanley Weir wrote English words for the song in 1908.
It was sung as the national anthem for many years before the government made it official in 1980.
O Canada! Our home and native land,
True patriot love in all thy sons command!
With glowing hearts we see thee rise
The True North strong and free,
From far and wide, O Canada,
We stand on guard for thee.
God keep our land glorious and free!
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee;
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.
Here are the words in French. The words in French and English do not mean the same thing.
Ô Canada! Terre de nos aĩeux,
Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux!
Car ton bras sait porter l'épée,
Et ta valeur de foi trempée
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits;
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits.
