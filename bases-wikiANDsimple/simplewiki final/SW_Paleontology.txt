Paleontology or Palaeontology is the study of fossils such as those of prehistoric animals and plants. Some palaeontologists study microorganisms (living things that are too small to see without a microscope), while other palaeontologists study giant dinosaurs.
It has two major branches- Paleobotany and Paleozoology. Any organism that is one million year old and preserved in any form on earth gets the status of a fossil.
