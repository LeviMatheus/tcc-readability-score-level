The Vedas are the four holiest books of the Hindu religion. Hindus believe they are the oldest books ever made by mankind. They are written in an old Indian language called Sanskrit. They have words (called "mantras") which are chanted at the religious ceremonies.
They were written between 1,500 and 500 BC. The Vedas have stories about the Hindu gods, instructions for rituals, hymns, poetry, and prayers. The word "Vedic" means something about the Vedas. The language of the Vedas is called "Vedic Sanskrit".
Hindus believe the Vedas are the basis of all Hindu religion. Even later types of Hinduism that are very different from the types of Hinduism that follow the Vedas respect them.
Rig Veda.
Rig Veda is the first Veda of the four Vedas. Rig Veda means a "Veda of praise". This Veda has several verses (hymns). These hymns praise a number of gods. This Veda is also the oldest Hindu holy book.
Sama Veda.
Sama Veda is the second Veda of the four Vedas. Sama Veda means the "Veda of sacred songs". This Veda also has many hymns. They were sung by the Hindu priests and other Hindus during religious activities.
Yajur Veda.
Yajur Veda is the third Veda of the four Vedas. Yajur Veda means "the Veda of the Yajus". Yajus were mantras sung during religious activities. Yajur Veda is divided into two parts. The name of the first part is Black Yajurveda, called "Taittiriya". The name of the second part is White Yajurveda, called "Vajasaneyi".
Atharva Veda.
Atharva Veda is the 10th Veda out of the four Vedas. Atharva Veda means the "Veda of knowledge". Ayurveda has connection with Atharva Veda.
It was made after the other three vedas.
All these books are considered by Hindus to be of ultimate knowledge on both types of education: spiritual and mental.
