An ASBO, or an Antisocial behaviour order, is a British legal term for an order that designed to stop people from being anti-social, which means to cause distress or alarm (among other things) to other people that do not live in the same place as themselves, according to the Crime & Disorder Act. 1998
An ASBO prohibits people from doing certain things, in certain times, in certain places. For instance, it might stop someone from gathering with friends in the park at 8 'o clock.
There is also something called an ABC, which stands for an Acceptable Behaviour Contract, and are often used to make sure people try to be "nice". It is flexible, and can be used in serious situations as well as low key ones.
