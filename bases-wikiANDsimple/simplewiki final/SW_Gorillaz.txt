Gorillaz are an animated English rock band. The band was invented by Damon Albarn, a member of the band Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, who has worked on the comic book series "Tank Girl". Even though the band members are fictional, they have released several albums and music videos. The band's members are 2D, Noodle, Russell Hobbs, and Murdoc Niccals.
The band's genre is mostly a combination of alternative rock, alternative hip hop, and electronica. It also has elements of experimental, trip hop, dub, and psychedelic rock.
Live performances.
Since they are an animated group, they cannot perform live like real bands can. At Gorillaz concerts, the real members of the band stand behind screens which show computer-generated images of the animated group performing.
