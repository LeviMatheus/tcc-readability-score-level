Giordano Bruno (1548 â€“ February 17, 1600) was an Italian philosopher, priest, cosmologist, and occultist. Bruno is known for his mnemonic system based upon epistemology. He was an early proponent of the idea of an infinite and homogeneous universe. He was burnt at the stake as a heretic by the Roman Inquisition.
