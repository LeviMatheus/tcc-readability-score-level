European colonization of the Americas is a term which many historians use to describe colonization and settlement by Europeans in North America and South America. It started with the discovery of America by Columbus in 1492. However, about 500 years before Colombus, the Norse had reached America and colonized Vinland. But, they did not continue. Thus, in a practical sense, colonization of America began with the arrival of Columbus.
The Spanish people were the first to win many parts of South and Central America. They also won many parts of North America. Later on, people from many countries of Europe reached the Americas.
