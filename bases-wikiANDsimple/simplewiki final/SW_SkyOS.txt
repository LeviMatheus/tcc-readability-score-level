SkyOS is a privately owned operating system currently in production. SkyOS is mostly POSIX compliant, and comes with the core of the open source GNU tools, including GCC. Due to its level of POSIX compliance and port of the GTK+ widget toolkit, many Linux or other UNIX applications have been ported, including AbiWord and Gaim, as well as a few games, such as "Quake". It was made by Robert Szeleney.
