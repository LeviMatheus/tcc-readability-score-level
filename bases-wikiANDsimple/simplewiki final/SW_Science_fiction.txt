Science fiction (often shortened to sci-fi or SF) is a genre of fiction (make believe) that has descriptions of the future, often involving stories about imaginary (make-believe) new technologies and inventions such as space ships, rockets, and robots. Science fiction's descriptions of the world are often different than the actual technology available. Science fiction stories often take place in other imaginary planets or universes, and there are often alien creatures.
Novels, movies, and other literature can be in the science fiction genre.
Science fiction writers often use SF to highlight issues by putting them into a futuristic setting. Usually the world is shown as very different to bring more focus to the issue. Good science fiction often is about common issues to everyone and every nation.
Science fiction is different from Fantasy. Fantasy is very often set in a world that resembles the Middle Ages.
