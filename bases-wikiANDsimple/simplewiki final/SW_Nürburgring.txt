The N端rburgring, known as simply "the Ring" by enthusiasts, is the name of a famous motorsport race track in N端rburg, Germany, built in the 1920s around the village and medieval castle of N端rburg in the Eifel, which is about 70 kilometres south of Cologne, 100 kilometres northwest of Mainz, and 120 kilometres northwest of Frankfurt.
Originally, the track featured four track configurations: the long "Gesamtstrecke" ("Whole Course"), which included the 22.810 km "Nordschleife" ("Northern Loop"), and the 7.747 km "S端dschleife" ("Southern Loop"). There also was a 2.281 km warm-up loop called "Zielschleife" ("Finish Loop") or better known as "Betonschleife", around the pit area.
Between 1982 and 1983 the start-finish area was demolished to create a new "GP-Strecke", and this is currently used for all major and international racing events.
