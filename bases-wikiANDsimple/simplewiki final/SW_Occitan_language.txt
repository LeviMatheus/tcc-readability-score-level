The Occitan language (Occitan: "Lenga d'Ã²c", French: "Langue d'oc") is a Romance language spoken in parts of southern France, Spain, and Italy.
The Occitan language took a different path from Latin than any of the official languages in the countries mentioned above. It was once called langue d'oc (language of "Oc") because the word for yes was "oc", as opposed to "oil" ("oi") or "sic" ("si"). Latin had no word for yes, and this is one way to distinguish among Romance languages.
