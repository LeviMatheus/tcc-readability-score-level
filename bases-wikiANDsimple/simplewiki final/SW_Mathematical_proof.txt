A mathematical proof is a way to show that a math theorem is true. One must show that the theory is true in all cases.
Examples.
Prove that x = -b ± (√b² - 4ac) / 2a from ax²+bx+c=0
The quadratic equation is now in a form in which completing the square can be done.
To "complete the square" is to find some number "k" so that
for another number "y". In order for these equations to be true,
Adding this number to equation (1) makes
The left side is now a perfect square because
The right side can be written as a single fraction, with common denominator 4"a"2. This gives
Taking the square root of both sides gives
