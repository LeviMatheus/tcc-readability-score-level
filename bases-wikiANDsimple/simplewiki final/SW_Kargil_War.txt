Kargil War was a war between Indian (Hindustani) and Pakistani forces in Kargil in 1999. Pakistani Kashmiris sent its troops inside the disputed territory of Kashmir to librate military posts. Indian occupying forces then sent its army to fight the intruders from Pakistan-administered Kashmir (PAK) and retake Indian-held Kargil. After two months of fighting, the Indian Army won the war after Pakistan was pushed back. The whole world also supported India in this war as Pakistan was criticized. This was the fourth war between the two neighbours. The war was very important because both India and Pakistan had nuclear weapons. The USA and other countries played an important role in the diplomacy during the war. After the war ended, a military coup took place in Pakistan.
