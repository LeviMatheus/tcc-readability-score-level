The 1977 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1977 in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1977 in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1977. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. The season was very inactive.
This season had a record low level of activity. Only eight tropical storms formed, and four hurricanes. Zero major hurricanes formed. The next time this happened was during the 2003 season. In addition, there was just one cyclogenesis in each of May, June, July, August, and October, which is also low. Activity in the central Pacific was zero, as no storms formed there nor moved in from the east.
