Crazy Horse (born about 1838 â€“ died September 5, 1877) was a Oglala Sioux Native American leader. There is a huge sculpture being carved of him in South Dakota.
When Crazy Horse was first born he was given the name of curly. When he was younger he had a vision when he wasn't supposed to and his family didn't know where he was. His father found him and was very unhappy at what young curly had done.
As crazy Horse grew into a man, he was given his father's name Crazy Horse. His father then changed his own name to Worm.
Crazy Horse had good medicine, so he was never killed when he went to battle. He led his people to Little Big Horn to combine with the Hunkpapa and Minconjou. There they fought General Custer and defeated him.
Eventualy Crazy Horse made a tough desicion to lead his people, the Oglalas, to a reservation because they were starving. Game was scarce and the buffalo were nearly gone. He had no choice but to leave the black hills. When he arrived at Fort Robinson, he was forced to give up his weapons and horses and was not happy. One day, even though he was granted time to go on a hunt, he was lied to and in an attempt to get away he was stabbed in his liver and died an death later that night, thus ending the Sioux Wars.
