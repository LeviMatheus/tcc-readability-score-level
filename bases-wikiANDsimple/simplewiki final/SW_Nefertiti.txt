Nefertiti (pronounced at the time something like *nafratiÀêta) (c. 1370 BC - c. 1330 BC) was the Great Royal Wife of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten. She was the mother-in-law and may have been stepmother of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun. Nefertiti may have also ruled as pharaoh under the name Neferneferuaten for a short time after her husband's death and before the accession of Tutankhamun, although this identification is doubted by the latest research. Her name in English means "the beautiful (or perfect) woman has come". Nefertiti was one of the most powerful queens in Ancient Egypt.
