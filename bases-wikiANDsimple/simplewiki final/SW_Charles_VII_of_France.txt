Charles VII of France (22 February 1403 â€“ 22 July 1461), was King of France from 1422 to his death. He was not crowned as king until 1429 because England controlled large parts of France. Joan of Arc took back land for him, but she died very young. The Hundred Years' War ended with France winning while Charles VII was king.
