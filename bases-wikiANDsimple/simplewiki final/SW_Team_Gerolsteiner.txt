Team Gerolsteiner ("UCI Team Code:" GST) is a German road bicycle racing team in the UCI ProTour. It is sponsored by the drinks company Gerolsteiner Brunnen and the bike company "Specialized".
The team was founded in 1998 with manager Hans-Michael Holczer and sports directors Rolf Gölz and Christian Henn. The contract with Georg Totschnig in 2001 helped make the team enter Division I. In 2003 the team participated in the Tour de France for the first time.
The Leader is Georg Totschnig, who has finished in the top 10 in the Tour de France and is an excellent climber. In 2005, Totschnig won stage 14 of the Tour, showing his skill on the 15km long climb up the Port de Pailhères (2000m at 8.2%). He was the first Austrian to win a tour stage since Max Bulla in 1931. In 2007, Georg Totschnig retired and Levi Leipheimer moved to the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team. The team used youngsters Markus Fothen and Stefan Schumacher to captain the team in the 2007 Tour de France.
In September 2007 Gerolsteiner said it would not renew its sponsorship.
