The coat of arms of a country is a symbol that the country uses for itself. The coat of arms of India is the symbol of India. It has four Indian lions standing on a circle. The idea for this coat of arms was taken from the Sarnath Lion Capital that was built by an Indian emperor named Ashoka. He built it around 250 BCE using a single piece of polished sandstone.
