Honor, spelt honour outside the United States, is the idea of the trustworthiness and social status of a person by the society, by judgement of his actions. The idea of honour, like most cultural things, is very different from place to place, and through time. In Europe in the Middle Ages, honour took form in the code of Chivalry. In Japan, a similar thing happened with Bushido. As time passed, the honor of a gentleman and his family was generally expressed in the practice of duelling. The idea has declined in Modern times, but still exists, mostly as an approval of one's actions by the society.
