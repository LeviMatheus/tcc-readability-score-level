Mole is the SI unit of measurement used to measure the number of things, commonly atoms or molecules. One mole of something is equal to 6.0221415×10²³ of it. So, one mole of elephants is equal to 6.0221415×10²³ elements. We call this number Avogadro's number. We use this number because it is the number of carbon atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12, which is the most common isotope of carbon. We can measure anything in moles, but it is not very useful for most things because the numbers are so big. For example, one mole of grapefruit would be as big as the earth.
One hydrogen gas molecule is made from two hydrogen atoms. Therefore, one mole of hydrogen gas is two moles of hydrogen atoms.
Because different molecules and atoms do not have the same mass, one mole of one thing does not weigh the same as one mole of something else. Atom and molecule mass is measured in u. One u is equal to one gram per mole. This means that if an atom has a mass of one u, one mole of this atom weighs one gram.
Math with the Mole:.
A methane molecule is made from one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms. Carbon has a mass of 12.011 u and hydrogen has a mass of 1.008 u. This means that the mass of one methane molecule is 12.011 u + (4*1.008u), or 16.043 u. This means that one mole of methane has a mass of 16.043 grams.
A mole can be thought of as two bags of different sized balls. One bag contains tennis balls and the other footballs. There are the same amount of balls in both bags but the mass of the footballs is much larger.It is a different way to measure things. Moles measure the number of particles, not the mass. So both bags contain three moles.
A mole is simply a unit of the number of things. Units are invented when existing units can not describe something well enough. Chemical reactions often take place at levels where using grams wouldn't make sense, yet using absolute numbers of atoms/molecules/ions would be confusing, too.
