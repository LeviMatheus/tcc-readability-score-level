A screw is a sharp piece of threaded metal similar to a nail. Unlike a nail, a screw has spiraling grooves down its spike. A screw is pressed down against wood and spun with a screwdriver so the wood goes into the grooves. This prevents the screw from falling out, as a nail could. Screws are basically divided in to wood screws, machine screws and self-tapping screws.
Machine screws have threads which have to be matched with nuts with female threads. Screws can be made of iron, steel, brass, bronze, etc.
Screw threads are measured either in millimeters or in numbers. screws are used in furniture, doors, appliances, mechanical applications etc.
Screwing and screws.
Screwing is the neatest way of holding together to materials. If no glue is involved, then the screwing can be dismantled. Screwing can be used to connect all materials.
These are three different types of screw.
Do not place screws in line as this weakens the wood.
Use the right size screwdriver for the screw head. A screwdriver that is too slim can damage the slot, too wide can tear the materials.
