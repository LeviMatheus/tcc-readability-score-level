Deuterostomes ("Deuterostomia") are a superphylum of animals. They are a subtaxon of the Bilateria branch of the subregnum Eumetazoa, and are opposed to the protostomes. Deuterostomes are distingued by their embryo, in deuterostomes, the first opening (the blastopore) becomes the anus, while in protostomes it becomes the mouth.
