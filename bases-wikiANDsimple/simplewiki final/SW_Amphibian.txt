Amphibians are a group of vertebrate animals. They form the class "Amphibia". "Amphi-"means both and "bios" refers to life.
They have four legs and are born from eggs. They live in the water as babies, and can go on land when they grow up. Frogs, salamanders, toads and caecilians are all amphibians.
Amphibians are born without legs, and grow legs as babies. When they grow up, they change shape, or metamorphosize. They eventually lose their gills and tails, and grow front and hind legs. Baby frogs, toads, or salamanders are called "tadpoles". They lay as many as 1000 eggs, usually in the water or in wet places. They eat other animals, especially insects.
Amphibians are cold blooded, wich means that their body temperature doesn't adapt to the weather.
There are about 5,700 living species of amphibians.
