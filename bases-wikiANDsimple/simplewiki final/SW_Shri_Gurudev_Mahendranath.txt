Shri Gurudev Mahendranath (April 29, 1911–August 30, 1991) was a British mystic, writer, poet, and guru of tantra who started the spiritual organization known as the "International Nath Order".
Biography.
Born Lawrence Amos Miles in London, England on April 29, 1911. While still a child, he had a number of unusual experiences which led him to become interested in spirituality and Paganism. As a young man, Shri Mahendranath met Aleister Crowley. Personal experience and Crowley's advice prompted him into a deeper study of meditation and the I Ching with Indian and other Asian masters.
During his life, Shri Mahendranath traveled to Ceylon, Thailand, Bangladesh, Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Australia. He studied Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, as well as Taoism, and Zen.
After some years, Shri Mahendranath arrived in India in 1953. On the auspicious occasion of Guru Purnima, he was made a Nath by H.H. Shri Sadguru Lokanath, the Avadhut of the Himalayas. Later, he was taught Tantra by Shri Pagala Baba of Ranchi and became his successor.
Shri Gurudev Mahendranath died on August 30, 1991. His last home was his hermitage—Shambhala Tapowan—near the Vatrak river, in the state of Gujarat, India.
Writings.
Shri Gurudev Mahendranath wrote a number of articles and essays on tantra and the spiritual life, including the "Twilight Yoga Trilogy", the "Levogyrate Tantra", and "The Londinium Temple Strain", subsequently collected under the title "The Scrolls of Mahendranath" in 1990. These works present the basics of spiritual life and the tantric path in a humorous and open manner. In 2002, an online version of "The Scrolls of Mahendrath & Other Writings" was published by the "International Nath Order". This online version contains Gurudev's poetry and earlier essays which were not included in the original print edition.
