A Conquistador (English: "Conqueror";: "Conquistadores", or "Conquistadors") was a Spanish soldier, explorer and adventurer. The "Conquistadors" invaded and conquered much of the Americas and the Philippines Islands and other islands in Asia Pacific. Many of them were "hidalgos" (noblemen of low category).
Their conquests brought those lands under Spanish colonial rule between the 15th and 17th centuries, starting with the 1492 settlement by Christopher Columbus in what is now the Bahamas.
Background.
The first Spanish conquest in the Americas was the island of Hispaniola (presently shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic). From there, Juan Ponce de León conquered Puerto Rico, Juan de Esquivel went to Jamaica and Diego Velázquez invaded Cuba. The first settlement on the mainland was Darién in Panama, settled by Vasco Núñez de Balboa in 1512. In these Caribbean regions the conquistadors found neither the great treasuries nor the endless supply of priceless spices they had hoped for. Therefore they aimed at further exploration, rather than a serious effort to make the best of the 'virgin' colonies.
The first immensely successful conquistador was Hernán Cortés. Between 1520 and 1521, Cortés, along with some Native American allies, conquered the mighty Aztec empire. So present day Mexico came under the dominion of the Spanish Empire, as New Spain.
