A pigment is something that is added to something else to give it color. Natural pigments can come from just about anything. Pigments can be made from animals, plants, rocks and minerals or even the ground itself, for example clay. Pigments can also be created by people.
An example of a pigment is ultramarine. It is a powder found in nature. It adds a blue color to paints and dyes.
