Quetzalcoatlus was a huge pterosaur. It was 12 meters across. It was one of the largest animals to ever fly. "Quetzalcoatlus" had a very long neck and head. When it stood on the ground it was as tall as a giraffe. It lived 65 million years ago, near the end of the time of dinosaurs.
"Quetzalcoatlus" probably ate fish. It had no teeth, but a very long beak. Some people think it ate by flying with its jaw in the water, and snapping up fish when it hit them. Birds called skimmers do this.
"Quetzalcoatlus" was shown in the movie "When Dinosaurs Roamed America" eating a dead Triceratops carcass. It was also shown when Triceratops and Anatotitan were first shown.
