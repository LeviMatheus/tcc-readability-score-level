A medicine wheel is a stone structure built by the natives of North America for spiritual and ritual purposes.
They appear mostly in Alberta, Canada. They were built by laying out stones in a circular pattern. They often look like a wagon wheel laying flat. They could be large, reaching up to 75 feet across.
Medicine wheels are still used today in the Native American traditions. However, the meaning is usually not shared outside the tribe.
