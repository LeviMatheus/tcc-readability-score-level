The Nintendo GameCube is a video game console made by Nintendo. Nintendo's previous console was called the Nintendo 64 (N64 for short). Nintendo's next console is the Wii, which was released on November 19, 2006.
Controller.
The GameCube's controllers have two analog joysticks. In many games, one of them is used to control a character, while the other is used to control the camera, or some other secondary function. In addition to the analog sticks and the digital pad (D-pad), there are eight buttons: A, B, Y, X, L, R, Z and Start.
Nintendo later released a wireless version of the controller, called the "Wavebird". Instead of wires, it used RF signals to communicate with the console and was powered by standard AA batteries.
