The Venus fly-trap is a carnivorous plant. Carnivores are animals that eat other animals. Carnivorous plants are plants that eat small animals, such as insects. Carnivorous plants grow in soil that has little nitrogen. All living things must have nitrogen. Carnivorous plants take nitrogen from the insects they eat.
The Venus Flytrap catches insects in a trap on the end of the leaf. The open trap is like an open book. Red color inside the trap attracts insects. When an insect walks inside, special sensitive hairs feel the insect move. That makes the trap shut quickly. The trap holds the insect inside until it is dead. Then the plant takes the nitrogen from the insectâ€™s body.
Venus fly-traps come from only one small part of America. But people anywhere can grow Venus Flytraps in pots.
The name is sometimes spelled Venus flytrap, Venus' flytrap, or Venus's-flytrap.
