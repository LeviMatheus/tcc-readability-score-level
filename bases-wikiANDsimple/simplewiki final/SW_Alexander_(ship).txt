The Alexander was one of six convict transport ships in the First Fleet. The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. The "Alexander" was a ship of 452 tons under the command of Duncan Sinclair. The ship was built in Hull in 1783. The ship had a contract with the British Government to carry convicts. The owners were paid at a rate of 10 shillings per ton per month until the ship returned to Deptford. They had to agree to keep the prisoners secure and in safe custody.. The ship took 195 male convicts to Australia.
