Claude Lévi-Strauss (; born November 28, 1908) is a French anthropologist. He came up with structural anthropology, which is the idea that people think about the world in terms of opposites—such as high and low, inside and outside, person and animal, life and death—and that every culture can be understood in terms of these opposites. "From the very start," he wrote, "the process of visual perception makes use of binary oppositions." ["Structuralism and Ecology", 1972]
