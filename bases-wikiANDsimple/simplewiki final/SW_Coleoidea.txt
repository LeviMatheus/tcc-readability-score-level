The Coleoidea are a group of mollusks making up most of the living cephalopods. Octopus, squid, and cuttlefish are all members of the Coleoidea. They do not have shells on the outside, but some do have a bone or shell inside. All Coleoidea live in the ocean. Some men of science think they may be the most advanced invertebrates.
