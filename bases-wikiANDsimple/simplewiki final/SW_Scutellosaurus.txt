Scutellosaurus was a thyreophoran dinosaur from the Early Jurassic period. It was small and armored with a tail that was a foot long. It grew up to a metre long and lived 205-198 million years ago. It was smaller than most of the members of its group (such as Ankylosaurus, Stegosaurus, Huayangosaurus etc.). It was also the earliest member. It might also be an ornithopod (related to Heterodontosaurus and Lesothosaurus). It is said to be related to the Scelidosaurus and is like a Nodosaurus. It had spikes like the stegosaurus but also had a beak, a mouth and an eye (with good senses) like the ankylosaurs. The other heterodontosaurs lived earlier than it except for one. This heterodontosaur was Edmarka from the Late Jurassic period. Scutellosaurus and all of its neighbors may have lived in hot climates with early grass and its predators were dinosaurs like the Dilophosaurus and Megapnosaurus. Like a crocodile it had scutes all over its body. It had no tail armor. It lived in places that were about 79 degrees fahrenheit. It could have walked on all four legs but ran on its two hind legs. It scientific name is "Scutellosaurus lawleri". It was only 17 inches tall at its hips. It had speeds up to 13 miles per hour (mph).
