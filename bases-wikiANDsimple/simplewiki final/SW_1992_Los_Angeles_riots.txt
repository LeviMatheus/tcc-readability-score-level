The 1992 Los Angeles riots, also called Rodney King uprising or Rodney King riots, started on April 29, 1992 when a jury set four white police men free. The jury was mostly Caucasian. The police men had beaten up the black motorist Rodney King very badly and filmed this, after he fled from police. Thousands of people in Los Angeles, mostly African American and Hispanic, joined in the riots. In all, 55 people were killed in the riots.
