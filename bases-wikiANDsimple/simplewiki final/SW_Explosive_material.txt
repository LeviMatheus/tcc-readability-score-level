Explosives are of two types: low explosives and high explosives. This classification depends on their rate of explosion. Low explosives burn very fast. High explosives explode with bursts.
A low explosive is a material, which burns very fast, but does not explode generally. For exploding them, people mix them with high explosives. Sometimes, even a low explosive may explode.
A high explosive bursts and explodes very fast. People use high explosives in mining, destroying old buildings. Military weapons use high explosives.
High explosives may belong to different groups: primary explosives and secondary explosives. Primary explosives rapidly react to shock, friction, and heat. Any shock, friction, or heat makes primary explosives to burn or blast fast. Secondary explosives do not react very fast to shock, friction, and heat. Any shock, friction, or heat may burn such explosives, but not make them to burst and blast. Some people call secondary explosives as base explosives. Some people also tell about another group of explosives. These are tertiary explosives. These explosives do not react to shock, friction, and heat. For explosion, tertiary explosives may need a mixture with secondary explosives.
high explosives produce more pressure than low explosives.
