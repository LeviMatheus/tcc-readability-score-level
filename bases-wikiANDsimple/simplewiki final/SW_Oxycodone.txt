Oxycodone is a synthetic opioid. It is used as an analgesic, to relieve pain. Its structure is similar to Codeine. As a painkiller, it is usually marketed in drugs that combine it with either Paracetamol or Aspirin. In some forms, the oxycodone can be extracted very easily. Some people use this as an illegal drug. Like with most other opioids, there is a high risk of addiction.
