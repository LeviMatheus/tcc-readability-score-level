the triple entente was atreaty to protect eachother.
The Triple Entente ("entente" â€” French for "agreement") was the name given to alliance (friendly relationship) between the United Kingdom, France and the Russian Empire. The agreement was made after the Anglo-Russian Entente, an agreement between Britain and Russia in 1907. The agreement was made stronger by agreements made with Japan, the United States and Spain. In this form, there was a balance of power (meaning no group was much stronger than any other one) with the "Triple Alliance" of Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy.
With the First World War, the Triple Entente became a military alliance. In 1915, Italy left the Triple Alliance, and from 1916 fought against Germany. The Russian revolution in October 1917 meant that Russia left the alliance, but the military alliance between France and the UK lasted until 1940, when Nazi Germany invaded France.
