A digital camera is a camera that uses an electronic sensor instead of film. The pictures are stored on a memory card instead of film. Because of this, a digital camera can hold many more pictures than the traditional film camera. A digital camera can sometimes hold hundreds of pictures. There are different sizes of memory cards and each size can hold a different number of pictures. A digital camera can use a USB cable that hooks into a computer to take the pictures from the camera and put them on the computer.
