"Ishy Bilady" is the national anthem (a song that represents the country) of the seven United Arab Emirates. The tune was written in the year 1971 without words to sing. Then, in the year 1996 Aref Al Sheikh Abdullah Al Hassan came up with words for the song.

عشت لشعب دينه الإسلام هديه القرآن
دام الأمان وعاش العلم يا إماراتنا
Transliteration.
Dinu hul islamu Hadhyu Ul Qura`anu
daamal amaanu wa aashal alam ya imaaratinah
English.
Live, my land; may the union of our emirates live.
May you live for a people
Whose religion is Islam, and whose guide is the Qur'an.
May I strengthen you in the name of God, O homeland.
My land, my land, my land, my land.
May God protect you from the evils of time.
We have vowed to build, to work.
To work, to be loyal, to work, to be loyal.
However long we may live, to be loyal, to be loyal.
May safety endure, and the flag live, O Emirates,
We would all make sacrifices for you, and with our blood saturate you.
We would give up our souls for you, O homeland.
