Asthma bronchiale (or simply Asthma) is a common disease that makes it hard for people to breathe at times. Asthma happens when the tubes that go to the lungs get irritated. They then become tight and inflamed. This makes the area inside the tubes thinner than it should be, which makes it harder to get air into the lungs. This is called an "asthma attack". Sometimes the attention from hospital is needed. When a person is having an asthma attack usually they will wheeze, breathe fast, and sometimes cough. Asthma attacks can be caused by many things like exercise, cold air, allergies, and breathing in certain chemicals.
Asthma is most caused because the airways react to so-triggers. Many people show allergic reactions to things like aspirin or the hair of certain pets. A good thing to do to reduce the risk and level of the asthma is to identify those triggers, and remove them from the environment of the person suffering from asthma.
Some asthma attacks can be dangerous. The worst-case scenario, known as status asthmaticus can be life-threatening.
Asthma can be controlled most often by avoiding contact with triggers, and by using certain drugs.
