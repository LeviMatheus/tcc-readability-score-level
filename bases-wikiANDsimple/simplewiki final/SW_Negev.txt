The Negev is a desert that covers about 60% of the current state of Israel. Only about 10% of the people that live in Israel live there. The negev is delimited by the border with Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the west, the Arabah in the east, and a line connecting Gaza city to Ein Gedi near the Dead Sea to the north.
