525 Adelaide is an S-type asteroid in the Flora family in the Main Belt.
The object A904 EB found March 14, 1904 by Max Wolf was named 525 Adelaide and was lost after. Later, the object 1930 TA found October 3, 1930 by Sylvain Arend was named 1171 Rusthawelia. In those pre-computer days, it was not realized until 1958 that these were one and the same object. The name Rusthawelia was kept (and finding the asteroid credited to Arend); the name 525 Adelaide was used again for the object 1908 EKa found October 21, 1908 by Joel Hastings Metcalf.
