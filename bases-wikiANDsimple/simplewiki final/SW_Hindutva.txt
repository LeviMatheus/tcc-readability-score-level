The Hindutva ideology is the central tenet of the organizations which advocate Hindu nationalism.
Many proponents of the Hindutva ideology portray violence against Muslims and Christians as a form of "self-defence" against "invaders". As the Hindutva ideology has grown more powerful over the years, many Hindutva activists have partaken in riots against minority communities in India. The Hindutva ideology is described as a fascist ideology. Although this ideology is associated with Hinduism, majority of Hindus who are tolerant or "secular" do not support the Hindutva movement. Some tolerant or "secular" Hindus describe the supporters of the Hindutva movement as "Hindu Taliban".
