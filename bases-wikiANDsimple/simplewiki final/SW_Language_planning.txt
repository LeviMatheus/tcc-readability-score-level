Language planning is the attempt to influence how a language is used. This is usually done ot make it possible to use the language for more subjects. Goals, objectves and strategies are made to change the way a language is used. For many languages there are special organisations, that look after the language. Examples of such organisations are the Academie Fran√ßaise for French or the British Council for English.
