Sedimentary rocks are rocks that are made from sediments (pieces of other rocks, animals, plants or minerals). Sedimentary rocks cover 75-80% of the Earth's land area. Other types of rock are igneous rock and metamorphic rock).
Types of Sedimentary Rock.
Chalk, limestone, and dolomite, are all made from a mixture of minerals and pieces of animals (especially animal shells). They are mostly formed in oceans.
Shale, sandstone, and conglomerate are all Clastic rocks (They are made from pieces of other rocks) The pieces may have come from erosion by water, ice or wind.
Coal is made from ancient plants.These rocks can be found any where in the universe.
The sediments become rock either by being buried and squeezed together or by being stuck together by a solution washing through them. When sedimentary rocks are heated, they become metamorphic rocks. They come from igneous rocks. The rocks all go round in a cycle.
