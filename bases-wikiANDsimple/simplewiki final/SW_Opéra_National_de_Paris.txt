History.
King Louis XIV allowed Jean-Baptiste Lully to start the "Académie Royale de Musique" in 1672. This was an organization that included opera, ballet, and music. The ballet company was part of the opera company. Then Louis XIV started the ballet school, called "Académie Royale de Danse", in 1661. From 1671 until Lully's death in 1687, the school was directed by the great dancing master Pierre Beauchamp, the man who set down the five positions of the feet.
In 1713 King Louis XIV made the Opera company a state institution. There was a group of professional dancers called "Le Ballet de l'Opéra". From that time until 1875 they used lots of theatres, each one of which was destroyed by a fire. All these companies were called Paris Opéra or Opéra de Paris.
On October 29, 1873, the old "Paris Opéra", known as the "Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique", which had been used since 1821, was destroyed by a fire which burned for 27 hours. By 1875 the opera company moved to the new "Palais Garnier" which was part of the rebuilding of Paris by Emperor Napoleon III.
When the "Opéra Bastille" was built in 1989 the company chose it as their main theatre.
