7 Iris (,)" is a large main belt asteroid. Its bright surface and small distance from the Sun make Iris the fourth brightest object in the asteroid belt after 4 Vesta, 1 Ceres, and 2 Pallas. But at a normal oppositions it marginally outshines the larger though darker 2 Pallas. It has a "mean" opposition magnitude of +7.8, comparable to that of Neptune, and can easily be seen with binoculars at most oppositions. At rare oppositions near perihelion Iris can reach a magnitude of +6.7, which is as bright as Ceres ever gets, and reports of it being seen without optical aid are unverified.
