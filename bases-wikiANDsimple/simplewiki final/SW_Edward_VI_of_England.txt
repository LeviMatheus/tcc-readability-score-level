Edward VI of England (12 October 1537 â€“ 6 July 1553) was King of England and King of Ireland from 28 January 1547 until his death. He was the son of Henry VIII of England and Jane Seymour.
His mother (Jane Seymour) died 12 days after his birth. He became king at the age of 9 when his father, Henry VIII, died. He was a young King, not very well known in history. He died when he was only 15 years old. His successor was his cousin Lady Jane Grey.
In the fictional story "The Prince and the Pauper" by Mark Twain, Edward VI is one of the main characters (the 'prince').
