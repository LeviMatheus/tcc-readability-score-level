"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" is a 1992 comedy horror movie about a cheerleader (Kristy Swanson) chosen by fate to fight and kill vampires. The movie is a light parody. It goes against the clich√©s of typical horror movies. The movie led to a darker and much more popular TV series of the same name. The television series starred Sarah Michelle Gellar and was created and produced by screenwriter Joss Whedon. Whedon often said how the television series was more like his vision than the movie. When the movie was first released, it was moderately successful and received mixed reviews from critics.
