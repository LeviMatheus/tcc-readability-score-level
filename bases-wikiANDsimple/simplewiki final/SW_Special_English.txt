Special English is a simple form of the English language used by a public radio station called Voice of America, run by United States government in daily Special English programs. Its news and feature programs are read more slowly than usual, using a limited number of English words and simple grammar.
For those whose mother language is not English, it is much easier to understand contents of programs, because it sounds clearer and simpler, and shorter sentences are used in articles. It can also help someone whose English is weak to improve his or her English. In some countries, for example China, Special English is more and more popular among people learning English.
Special English was first used on October 19, 1959.
