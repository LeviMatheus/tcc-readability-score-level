South Vietnam is a former country, located in the south of present-day Vietnam, that existed from 1954 to 1976. The country lay south of the local Demilitarized Zone, and North Vietnam was situated to the north of it.
As the Republic of Vietnam, it was ruled first by the unpopular Ngo Dinh Diem (Ngô Đình Diệm) and then by a military dictatorship.
The division of Vietnam took place during the Geneva Conference of 1954.
