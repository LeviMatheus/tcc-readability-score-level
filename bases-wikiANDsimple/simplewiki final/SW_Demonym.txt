A demonym or gentilic is a word used for people or the inhabitants of a place. The name of a people's language is usually the same as this word, for example, the "French" (language or people). Some places may not have a word for the people that live there.
Irregular forms.
In many cases, both the location's name and the demonym are created by using a suffix, for example "England" and "English" and "Englishman". This is not always true, for example, "France" → "French".
In a few cases, the name of the country is not at all related to the name of the people ("Netherlands" → "Dutch"). This is usually because the two words come from different languages.
Demonyms can be nouns or adjectives. In many cases the noun and adjective forms are the same ("Canadian/Canadian"); in other cases they are different ("Spaniard/Spanish").
In the case of Canadian provinces and territories and U.S. states, demonyms are not usually used as adjectives.
Cultural problems.
Some peoples, mainly cultures that were taken over by European colonists, have no demonym. They may also have a demonym that is the same as the name of their nation. Examples include Iroquois, Aztec, Māori, and Czech. Often, the "native" languages of these people have forms that did not get used in English. In Czech, for example, the language is "Čeština", the nation is "Česko" or "Česká republika", and the people are "Češi".
The demonym for people of the United States of America has a similar problem. "American" refers to both the United States and to the two American continents. "United Statian" is not used in English, but it exists in Spanish ("estadounidense"), French ("étatsunien(ne)"), Portuguese ("estado-unidense" or "estadunidense"), Italian ("statunitense"), and also in Interlingua ("statounitese"). "US American" (for the noun) and "US-American" can be used, and is a common demonym in German ("US-Amerikaner").
