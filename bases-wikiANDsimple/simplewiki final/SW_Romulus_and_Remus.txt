Romulus and Remus were the legendary founders of Rome. In Roman mythology they were twin brothers, children of Rhea Silvia and the god Mars.
Birth and youth.
Rhea Silvia was the daughter of Numitor Silvius, king of Alba Longa, a legendary town founded by Ascagne, son of Aeneas. When Numitor's brother Amulius became king by force, he made Rhea Silvia a Vestal Virgin, so she would not have children who could be kings instead of him. But the god Mars seduced her and she had the twins Romulus and Remus. Rhea Silvia was punished, and her sons were thrown into the Tiber, but were saved by the river god Tiberinus, who also saved Rhea Silvia and married her. Romulus and Remus were found by a wolf who suckled them. The brothers were later found by a farmer who raised them.
The founding of Rome.
Romulus and Remus founded the city of Rome. But Romulus killed Remus in a fight and he went back to Amulius's palace and killed him.
