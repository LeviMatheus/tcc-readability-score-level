Cellular respiration is what cells do to break up sugars into a food that the cell can use as energy. This happens in all forms of life. Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses as energy. Some simple organisms can only go through anaerobic cellular respiration, also known as fermentation.
The "formula" for aerobic cellular respiration is
C6H12O6 + O2 → CO2 + H2O + Energy (as ATP)
Glucose + Oxygen → Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP)
Aerobic cellular respiration has three stages. Each is important, but could not happen without those preceeding it. Step one is Glycolysis or the break down of glucose. Step two is the Krebs Cycle. The final step is the Electron Transport Chain, or the ETC.
