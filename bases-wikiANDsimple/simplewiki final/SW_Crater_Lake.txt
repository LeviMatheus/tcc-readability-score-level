Crater Lake is a caldera lake in the U.S. state of Oregon. It is the primary attraction of Crater Lake National Park and it is famous for its blue color and clear water. The lake partly fills a nearly 4,000 feet (1,220 meters) deep caldera that was formed by the collapse of the volcano Mount Mazama.
John Wesley Hillman was the first European American to discover Crater Lake. He named the lake "Deep Blue Lake". The lake was renamed at least three times, as Blue Lake, Lake Majesty, and lastly Crater Lake.
Crater Lake is known for its famous piece of driftwood named the "Old Man of the Lake." It is a tree that has been moving up and down in the water for more than a century. Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been rather well preserved.
While having no native fish population, the lake had many different kinds of fish between the years of 1888 and 1941. Several species of fish are still in the lake to this day.
