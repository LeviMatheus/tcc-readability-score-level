The Saturn Award is an award presented every year by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films to honor the top works in science fiction, fantasy, and horror in movie, television, and home video. The prestigious Saturn Awards were devised by Dr. Donald A. Reed, who felt that movies within those genres were never given the appreciation they deserved. The physical award is a representation of the planet Saturn, surrounded with a ring of film. The award was initially, and is still sometimes loosely referred to as a Golden Scroll.
Similar to other awards, like the Oscars, the Emmys and the Grammys, the Saturn Awards are voted on by members of the presenting Academy. There are also special awards for lifetime achievement in the field.
The awards were first presented in 1972.
