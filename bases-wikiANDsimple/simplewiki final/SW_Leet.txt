Leet, also called 1337, l33t, Leetspeak, or 13375|>34|< is a language which replaces the Latin alphabet with numbers and ASCII printable symbols. It is used a lot on the Internet in fora, chat rooms and online games.
It comes from the word "elite" which means "better than everyone else". 1337 is mostly used for English, but can also be used with other languages including French, Spanish and German.
Leetspeak.
Leetspeak is a mixture of words (mostly computer-related) spelled wrong on purpose, usually coming from typos (e.g. "the" becomes "t3h"). The words of Leetspeak are usually put together to create a 'dialect' (small language). This dialect is used in some places for funniness. 1337 uses numbers, ASCII symbols, and diacritics together to make symbols resembling Latin letters. For example, in the name "David" would translate in 13375|>34|< as |)/-\\/1|).
1337 /-\|_|>|-|/-\|33+.
Note: Most of the time it is only the vowels that are changed and then usually only they are replaced by numbers, it is unusual to see someone use the Leet Alphabet to spell out a whole word.
Intentional mispelling.
When people write in leet, they spell some words wrong all the time. They might do this to laugh at new people who do not write words with their keyboards well, or might just be making fun of pronunciation or spelling in the English Language.
Wrong grammar.
When a person writes in English the person must follow English rules, but most of the time people who write in leet do not use these rules. When they write in leet they try to write it in a special way, so that it is very different from English.
"l33t is teh suck!" (meaning: 'leet sucks') shows that in leet people can use their own rules, and not use the English rules. A lot of times adjectives (describing words) are turned into nouns. The leet word "teh" (the) is also often placed in front of verbs, as in "I teh pwnd j00" (meaning I the owned you, meaning: I beat you badly). another example might be I 4m t3h pwnage!!!!11!!11 (meaning I am the best!)
Leet speakers may also speak normally but with out the vowels. Fr exmpl nmbr 1 u cn tll it wrks.= For example number one you can tell it works.
A normal leet speak convo (conversation).
me sup? ---->this means whats up?
person: nm u?---> this means not to much you?
me nm, nm--->this means not much,not much
person: nm hbu?---> not much how about you?
as you can see, many of these are acronyms and leet speak is actually not as commonly used.
