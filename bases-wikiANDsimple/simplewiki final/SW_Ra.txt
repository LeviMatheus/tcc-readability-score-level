"For the chemical element, see Radium."
In Egyptian mythology, Ra was the god of the sun. He was also called Re. He was the most important god in ancient Egypt. He had many names, such as Amun-Ra, and Ra-Horakhty. It was said he was born each morning in the East, and died each night in the West. In the night he traveled through the underworld. This is why the West side of the Nile was known as the land of the dead.
Worship.
The cult of Ra began to grow from around the time of the II Dynasty, establishing Ra as the sun god. By the IV Dynasty, the Pharaohs were seen as "Sons of Ra". His worship increased much in the V Dynasty, when he became a state deity. Pharaohs had pyramids, obelisks and solar temples built in his honour.
