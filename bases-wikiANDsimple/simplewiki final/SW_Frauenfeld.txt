Frauenfeld is the capital city of the canton of Thurgau in Switzerland. It is also the capital city of the district of Frauenfeld.
Early history.
The city is first written about in 1246. It grew up around the Frauenfeld castle on the land of the Reichenau convent.
In 1264, it became the property of the Habsburgs. In 1374, the Habsburgs bestowed the right of judgment for all of Thurgau (which then included St. Gallen) on the Duke of Frauenfeld.
Twice in the 1700s, Frauenfeld was partly destroyed by fire, in 1771 and in 1788.
The fall of the old Old Swiss Confederacy in 1798 as a result of the French invasion brought an end to the gatherings in Frauenfeld.
Modern history.
In 1919, the municipalities of Langdorf, Kurzdorf, Huben, Herten, and Horgenbach became part of Frauenfeld. In 1998, Gerlikon, Sch√∂nenhof, and Zelgli joined Frauenfeld.
