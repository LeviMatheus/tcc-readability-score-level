Abigail and Brittany Hensel (born March 7, 1990 in Minnesota, United States) are conjoined twins with mostly one body and two heads. They are joined at the pelvis and each one controls one side of their body, which means they have to do things together. Brittany is on the left, and Abigail is on the right. They have two spines that join at the pelvis. They have two stomachs and three lungs, and at birth they had a third arm in between their heads. The third arm was not properly developed, so it was removed.
