Ville Mönkkönen, born in 1983, is a Finnish painter and PC game programmer. At this time, he is working on his next game, "Cormoon".
Ville's games have settings that range from fantasy to sci-fi, and they all include art created by himself. Some of this art is on his art gallery. A unique trait Ville has is how he will talk with fans of his games. He checks all of the game ideas written to him on his website's forums. "Notrium", his newest game, is at version 1.341, and has a number of modification files free for download. Ville's first two games were released in Finnish, and the rest in English, though versions of the Finnish ones have been translated into English and can be downloaded at the popular independent game site, Caiman.
