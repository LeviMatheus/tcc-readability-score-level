Repentance means that a person wants to get rid of the sin that it has committed. In some cases, individuals or nations repent of their sins and are spared God's judgment. Sometimes the punishment avoided is destruction in this life, sometimes it is damnation.
If repentance is successful one speaks of salvation.
