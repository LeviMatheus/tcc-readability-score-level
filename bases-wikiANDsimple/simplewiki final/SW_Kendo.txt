Kendo' is a popular sport originating in Japan. It is swordplay with two-handed bamboo swords and wearing armour. In English Kendo means the "way of the sword" and in Japan it is the art of samurai fighting. Kendo moves can trace their origin back to the moves used by the Samurai warriors in medieval Japan. The rules and gear of kendo were first come up in the 18th century and its modern rules and styles date to 19th century.
The weapon used in kendo is a bamboo sword, called "shinai". The kendo armour, which the players must wear, is called "bogu" and is made of helmet ("men"), breastplate ("do"), apron ("tare") and special gloves ("kote"). You may hit your opponent on seven legal places: both sides and top of helmet ("men"), on either hand (gloves, "kote") or either side of the body breastplate ("do"). There is also one legal thrust ("tsuki") on throat. You must also shout aloud the name of the place where you are going to hit. You get a point of a successful hit.
One who does kendo is called a "kendoka". Kendo is also popular in western Europe and North America.
