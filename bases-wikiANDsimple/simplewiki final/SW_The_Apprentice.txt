"The Apprentice" is a television show that first aired in 2004 in the United States. The show has a group of 15-18 businessmen and -women competing in an elimination-style competition for a one-year, $250,000 job of running one of host and executive producer Donald Trump's companies. "The Apprentice" was developed by Mark Burnett, who successfully brought "Survivor" to the US. The show now has many international versions as well as several imitations. The show popularized the catch phrase, "You're Fired!".
In the USA there have been seven seasons. In the last one, all the contestants were celebrities. Season 8, which will also feature celebrities, is expected in January 2009.
