A trojan horse (Sometimes called a trojan) is a special computer program. Trojan horses are programs that pretend to do a certain thing, but in reality they do something else. In some cases the user notices, in other cases they do not. Spyware programs are current examples of programs that work in that way.
It was named after the Trojan Horse in Greek mythology.
