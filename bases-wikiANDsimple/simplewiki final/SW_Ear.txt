The ear is the part of the body that lets people hear. People and most vertebrate animals have two ears.
Some animals do not hear through ears. Spiders have small hairs on their legs that they can hear with.
Some animals have large ears. The rabbit has large ears so it can hear very well, which are used to listen for predators.
The ear works by funneling sound to the inner ear. These vibrations are sent to the brain by a network of nerves.
Some types of elephant use their large ears to cool themselves in the heat of their homeland.
