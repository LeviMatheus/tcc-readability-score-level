War communism is the name for the economic policies that Vladimir Lenin introduced in Russia. Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik political party. It was introduced in 1918, and he got rid of it in 1921 because it was not successful. He introduced New Economic Policies in 1921 instead.
It was bad for the Russian economy. This is because they took away extra grain produced by the workers. This was known as grain requisitioning. Workers were not allowed to sell their extra food. So workers didn't produce much food any more, because there was no point because no food could be given out any more because no extra was produced, Russia ended up with lots of people who did not have any food.
