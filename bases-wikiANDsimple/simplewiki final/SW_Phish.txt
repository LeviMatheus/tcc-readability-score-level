Phish is a hippie/jam band. They formed in Vermont in 1983. They broke up in 2004. There lead singer was Trey Anastatio, who went on and formed his own band. Phish was often compared to a modern day Greatful Dead, and had a similar following with "Phish Heads" traveling across the country with the band on tour.
Phish can be to many not merely a band. It comes as a feeling or a memory, a laugh or a sigh. The beautiful music that has been made by the four members of Phish is some of the most mindblowing music there has been. But you have to get it. If you dont get IT...Then please please watch the link and foresee the magic yourselves http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpZ5NHPVIAk&feature=related
