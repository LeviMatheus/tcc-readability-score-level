Old age is when a person is old and near the time when he or she dies. These people are usually retired from work and spend their time in other ways like helping take care of small children who are kin to them in some way. Often people of old age have wrinkly skin. They will move slower, and become constantly cold. They will start to have many health problems, and take a lot of medicine. The reason for this is that their bodies are slowly deteriorating, so they have more problems, especially with moving. People who are of old age are also called Elders. Elders are considered to be wise because they have had much experience in their long lives. Many cultures view elders with respect and kindness, and depend upon them to pass down knowledge to the younger people.
