129 Antigone is a big main belt asteroid. Radar observations indicate that it is made of almost pure nickel-iron. It and other similar asteroids probably come from the core of a shattered Vesta-like planetesimal which had a differentiated interior. It was found by C. H. F. Peters on February 5, 1873 and named after Antigone, the Theban princess in Greek mythology.
In 1979 a possible moon of Antigone was suggested based on lightcurve data. A model constructed from these shows Antigone itself to be quite spherical.
Since 1985, a total of three stellar occultations by Antigone have been seen.
