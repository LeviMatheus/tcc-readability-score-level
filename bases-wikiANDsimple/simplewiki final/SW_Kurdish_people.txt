The Kurds are an ethnic group found in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Armenia, Turkey and Lebanon. They have no country of their own.
Kurds are indo-European settlers together with the people of Western and northwestern Iran, widely thought to be descended from the Medes. They speak Kurdish.
The Kurds have similarly distinct features as those of south Europe, however their looks are not single based ranging from blondes to brunettes and although mainly brown eyes can have multi-coloured colours. they have a rich culture which is their own and despite the long struggle by its neighbouring enemies to demolish it: it remains a strong influence in their way of life.
Today, there are around to 27 to 37.5 million Kurds. Most are Muslim.
