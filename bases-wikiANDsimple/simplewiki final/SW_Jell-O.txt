Jell-O is a company owned by Kraft Foods that makes jelly desserts. This includes fruit gels, puddings and artificial sweeteners.
Jell-O is also the name of their most popular product, which is made from gelatin. This comes from the colagen in cow and pig bones. It is heated to high temperatures and then taken from the bones.
It was first sold in 1902, and three new flavours were added within the first decade. They were chocolate, cherry and peach. The chocolate flavour was removed in 1928, and many more flavours have been added since.. It has been advertised as "America's Most Famous Dessert".
