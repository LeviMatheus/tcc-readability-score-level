"Good Night, and Good Luck."Â is an Academy Award-nominated 2005 movie directed by George Clooney. It was written by Clooney and Grant Heslov. It portrays the conflict between veteran radio and television journalist Edward R. Murrow and U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, especially relating to the anti-Communist Senator's actions with the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
The movie, although released in black and white, was filmed on color film stock but on a grayscale set. It was later color corrected to black and white during post-production. It focuses on the theme of media responsibility. It also addresses what occurs when the media offer a voice of dissent against the government. The movie takes its title from the line with which Murrow routinely closed his broadcasts.
Taglines: "They took on the government with nothing but the truth"; "We will not walk in fear of one another."
