Belgium is made of 589 municipalities (Dutch: "gemeenten", French: "communes", German: "Gemeinde"). These municipalities are grouped into five provinces.
Usually, municipalities are the smallest subdivisions of Belgium, but in municipalities with more than 100,000 people living there, they get divided into Districts ().
