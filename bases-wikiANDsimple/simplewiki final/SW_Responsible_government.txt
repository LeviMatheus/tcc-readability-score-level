Responsible government is a principle of some democratic governments. It has nothing to do with whether a government has responsibility.
In the government of a country that uses responsible government, the leaders of the executive branch of government (called the cabinet) are also members of the legislature. Also, the cabinet must have the support of the majority of the legislature to stay in power. If it loses the support of the legislature, there will be an election or a different political party will make a new cabinet.
Countries that use responsible government usually have parliamentary systems of government. Some examples of countries that have responcible government are the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.
In countries that do not have responsible government, the cabinet and the legislature are each elected separately. This system has more separation of powers than a system with responsible government and is called. Some examples of countries that "do not" have a system of responsible government are the United States and France.
