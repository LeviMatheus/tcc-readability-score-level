"Verão Vermelho" is a song by Santana which came off the album Festival. Carlos Santana pays homage to the late, legendary Brazilian singer, Elis Regina. This song features some excellent acoustic guitar with The Waters Family background vocalists singing the meaningless words, ”Badadup, badadup, badadup, ba pa pa ba pa pa.” Santana plays a flamenco guitar solo. This is a first for him as the track ends with a keyboard flourish. He also plays a flamenco guitar solo during the intro. "Verão Vermelho" is Portuguese for "Red Summer". This song was originally performed by Elis Regina, and it appeared on her 1970 album "Em Pleno Verao".
