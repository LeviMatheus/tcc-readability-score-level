The United Nations (UN) is an international organization. It was started after World War II with the idea of making a stronger version of the League of Nations, that was supposed to stop wars from happening. Most nations are members of the UN, and send people to the headquarters to hold meetings and pass resolutions (make decisions) about global issues.
The main building for the United Nations is located in New York City in the United States of America.
The United Nations' goal is to keep world peace, improve world's living conditions in general to make the world a better place to live in.
