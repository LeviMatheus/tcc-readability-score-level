Grand unification theory was thought of by a Pakistani scientist, Dr. Abdus Salam. He combined two forces of the universe, the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force. These are two of the fundamental forces of nature, which are responsible for all of the pushes and pulls in the universe. He received the Nobel Prize in 1979 because of this theory.
