Humberside was a non-metropolitan county of England. It was set up in 1974.
It was not popular, because the north and south banks of the Humber used to be in different counties, and there were no links between the two.
Even the building of the Humber Bridge, the longest bridge in Europe at the time, did not encourage the two sides of the river to mix.
