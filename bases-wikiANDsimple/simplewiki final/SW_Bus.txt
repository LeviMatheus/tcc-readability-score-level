A bus is a large wheeled vehicle meant to carry many different persons along with the driver. The name is a shortened version of omnibus, which means "for everyone" in Latin. Buses used to be called omnibuses, but people now simply call them "buses".
A place on a sidewalk where people wait for a local bus is called a "bus stop". A building where people wait for a long-distance bus is called a "bus station".
