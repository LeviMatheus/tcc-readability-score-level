Maximilian Carl Emil Weber (pronounced: maks ˈveːbɐ) (21 April 1864 – 14 June 1920) was a German political economist and sociologist who was considered one of the founders of the modern study of sociology and public administration. He began his career at the University of Berlin, and later worked at Freiburg University, University of Heidelberg, University of Vienna and University of Munich. He had influence on German politics of his time, because he was an advisor to Germany's negotiators at the Treaty of Versailles and to the commission that drafted the Weimar Constitution.
Weber is known for his work in the sociology of religion. His most famous work is his essay "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism".
