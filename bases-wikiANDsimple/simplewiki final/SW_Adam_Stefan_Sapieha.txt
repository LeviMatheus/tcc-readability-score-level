"His Eminence" Prince Adam Stefan Stanisław Bonfatiusz Józef Cardinal Sapieha (14 May 1867 – 23 July 1951) was a Polish prelate of the Roman Catholic Church and, what some might call, mentor of Pope John Paul II.
Sapieha was born in 1867 in the castle of Krasiczyn to a family of nobles. He was the youngest of the seven children of Prince Adam Stanisław Sapieha-Kodenski and Princess Jadwiga Klementyna Sanguszko-Lubartowicza.
He was educated at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he was also ordained a priest on 1 October 1893 by Bishop Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko (later Bishop of Kraków and Cardinal). Father Sapieha did pastoral work in the diocese of Lemberg, whose seminary he served as a faculty member for four years until becoming its rector.
Appointed bishop of the diocese of Kraków on 24 November 1911, he was consecrated by Pope Pius X on 17 December of the same year. When Sapieha's diocese was elevated to the jurisdiction of an archdiocese in 1925, he became the first Archbishop of Kraków in its nine hundred-year history. He was awarded in 1936 with the White Eagle Order.
Arcbishop Sapieha, in August 1944, was forced to operate the seminary in secret due the Nazi invasion of Kraków; he moved his seminarians (including the future Pope John Paul II, Karol Wojtyła) into his episcopal residence to finish their training.
He was created a Cardinal Priest, of the title of "S. Maria Nuova", on 18 February 1946. Later on the same year he conferred priestly ordination to Karol Wojtyła in the chapel of his episcopal residence. Sapieha knew Wojtyła was destined to become a priest when a young Karol delivered a welcoming speech to the archbishop on a visit to his school.
He died on 23 July 1951, at the age of 84. Cardinal Sapieha is buried in the castle of Wawel (in Kraków).
