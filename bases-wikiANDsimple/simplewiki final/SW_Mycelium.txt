The Mycelium is the part of a fungus that is underground (or inside another substance). It looks somewhat like roots, that branch. It may be very thickly woven. The fungus uses it to extract nutritients.
The part of the fungus most people associate with a fungus (the stem and perhaps hat) is only there for reproduction.
