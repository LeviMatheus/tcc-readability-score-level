A, also known as a or, is a type of city in Japan. These cities all have a population over 500,000 people. The Cabinet of Japan, under Article 252, Section 19 of the Local Autonomy Law, named 17 cities as being designated cities.
Designated cites are different from other cities in Japan. Each city does many of the things normally done by prefectures in certain areas. These area include public education, social welfare, sanitation and business licensing. The prefecture is still has the authority for these areas but the designated cities control most of the work that needs to be done.
