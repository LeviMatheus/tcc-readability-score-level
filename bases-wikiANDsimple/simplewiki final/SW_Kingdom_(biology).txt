Kingdom is the highest rank used in the biological taxonomy of all organisms. Each kingdom is split into phyla.
Monera - the most simple living things.
Protista - bacteria with only one cell.
Fungi - mushrooms, mold and other fungi.
Plantae - all plants, such as trees and grass.
Animalia - all animals, including people.
Kingdom is the king in the mneomic, or a saying to help a person remember something, King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti.
Summary.
Sometimes entries in the table, which are next to each other, do not match perfectly. For example, Haeckel placed the red algae (Haeckel's Florideae; modern Florideophyceae) and blue-green algae (Haeckel's Archephyta; modern Cyanobacteria) in his Plantae, but in modern classifications they are considered protists and bacteria respectively. However, despite this and other failures of equivalence, the table gives a useful simplification.
