Flag semaphore is a system of spreading information at a distance by using two flags. Information is told by the positions of the flags. Each set of positions has a meaning.
Signalling.
Signalling uses two flags. A person signally would commonly stand on a platform about 6-10ft (1.8 - 3m) above the ground. They would use a bright orange, red and white flag. The was a problem because it also made it easier for the enemy to see him and shoot him. The newer system uses two short poles with square flags. The signalman holds one pole in each hand. The poles are held in one of eight possible directions. Except for in the "rest position", the flags do not cross over each other. Flags of different colors are used based on whether the signals are sent by sea or by land. At sea, the flags are coloured red and yellow. On land, they are white and blue.
