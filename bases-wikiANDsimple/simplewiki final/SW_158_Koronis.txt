158 Koronis ("kuh ROE niss") is a Main belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Viktor Knorre on January 4, 1876 from the Berlin observatory. It was the first asteroid he found.
The asteroid itself may not be interesting, but the Koronidian family of asteroids named after it is one of the most important. One member of the family, 243 Ida, has been visited by spacecraft, and gives some idea of how the other asteroids in the family may look.
Based on a model constructed from the lightcurve, the shape of Koronis looks like that of Ida, although it is a bit bigger.
