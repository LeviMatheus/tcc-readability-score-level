"Dreamgirls" is a Broadway musical, which originally ran in New York City for over a thousand performances between December 20, 1981 and August 11, 1985. Set in the 1960s and 1970s and written for a mostly African American cast, "Dreamgirls" is about the story of a fictional all-female singing group called "The Dreams", who were loosely based upon Motown singers Diana Ross & The Supremes. The musical was written by Tom Eyen, who wrote the story, dialogue, and song lyrics, and Henry Krieger, who wrote the music. After it was no longer staged on Broadway, "Dreamgirls" continued to be performed by high schools, colleges, and community theater groups. The most famous song in the musical is "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going," which was recorded by Jennifer Holliday, who won a Tony Award for playing one of the main characters, Effie White.
Twenty-five years after "Dreamgirls" was first staged on Broadway, a film version of the musical was produced by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. It was directed by Bill Condon, who wrote the script for the film version as well. The film version of "Dreamgirls" played for its first two weeks in limited reserved-seating screenings known as road shows. The film was released in theaters acorss the United States and Canada on December 25, 2006, and in countries across the rest of the world in January and February of 2007. "Dreamgirls" won three awards at the 64th Golden Globe Awards ceremony in 2007, including Best Picture - Musical or Comedy, and won two Oscars at the 79th Academy Awards.
