The 1950-1969 Pacific hurricane seasons all began on May 15, 1950-69 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1, 1950-69 in the central Pacific. They ended on November 30, 1950-69. These dates conventionally delimit the time of year when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean.
Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data on east Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable. Most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land. Only ones that made landfall or are notable in some way are mentioned.
