Planta Solar 10 (PS10) is a solar power plant located in Sanlucar la Mayor, Spain.
The plant is made up of a tower located in the center of a large field covered in many mirrors. Each of the 624 moveable mirrors has an area of 120 m2 (1290 ft2). The mirrors reflect the light from the Sun to the top of the tower. The heat warms water within pipes in the central tower turning it into steam. The steam drives turbines which, at peak, put out 11 MW of electricity.
The planet is really good for providing electricity during the hottest parts of the day when air conditioning demand is the highest.
