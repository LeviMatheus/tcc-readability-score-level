Iapetus is a large moon of Saturn. It was discovered by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1671. Iapetus is unusual in that one side is very bright and the other side is very dark. When Cassini observed the moon, he could only see the moon on one side of Saturn. He concluded that the moon is darker on side than the other, later confirmed by the Voyager 1 spacecraft. Iapetus also has an equatorial ridge discovered by the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft on December 31, 2004.
