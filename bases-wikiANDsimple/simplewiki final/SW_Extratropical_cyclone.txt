An Extratropical cyclone (also known as "cyclones", "European windstorms", "nor'easters", and "mid-latitude cyclones") is a type of cyclone. It is a large low-pressure weather area with rain and wind and clouds, that is not similar to tropical cyclones or low-pressure weather areas from cold polar places. They are really many masses of cold and warm fronts producing rain, heavy wind, and sometimes tornadoes and even hail. Some Extratropical cyclones are made from tropical cyclones that become weak but don't die when they move over cold water. Sometimes, these weather areas can become even stronger than before as they turn into Extratropical cyclones. When made from tropical cyclones, they can still have an eye (a place in the middle of a tropical cyclone that is not as windy, cloudy, or rainy). European windstorms are sometimes made when wind from the northwestern part of the Atlantic carry them more east and north towards Europe. Nor'easters often hit northeastern North America, and are made when it is cold, most often in late fall. Wind from the west part of the Atlantic moves them north. They become stronger, and drop snow on the areas it moves into. When a nor'easter drops in pressure and become stronger, by more than one millibar every hour, it is called a weather bomb. Hurricane Hazel was Extratropical but still hurricane-level when it hit Toronto, for example.
