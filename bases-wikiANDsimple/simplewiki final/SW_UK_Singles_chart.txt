The UK Singles Chart is compiled by The Official UK Charts Company (OCC) on behalf of the British record industry. The chart week runs from Sunday to Saturday, with the chart being printed in Music Week magazine (Top 75 only), ChartsPlus (Top 200), and published online on various sites (generally Top 40 only). Around 6,500 UK retail outlets contribute sales data, as well as most UK online digital download stores. Unlike in the U.S., no airplay statistics are used for the official UK Singles Chart. Most UK singles are released in record shops on a Monday.
