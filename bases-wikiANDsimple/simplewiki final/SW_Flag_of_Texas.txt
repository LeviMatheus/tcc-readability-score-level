The Texas flag is known as the "Lone Star Flag". This flag was introduced to the Republic of Texas on December 28, 1838, by Senator William H. Wharton. It became its national flag on January 24, 1839.
When Texas became the 28th state of the United States of America on December 29, 1845, its national flag became the state flag. Each color means a special symbol on the flag: blue stands for loyalty, white for purity, and red for bravery.
