The F-22 Raptor is a fighter made by Lockheed Martin. It first flew in 1990, and entered service in the United States Air Force in 2005. Because it is expensive, not as many will serve as other fighters. It uses stealth, which means it cannot be seen on radar. It can hold 6 AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles and 2 AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles. Its top speed is 2.4 times the speed of sound and it features thrust vectoring, where the plane's thrust nozzles turn to turn it.
