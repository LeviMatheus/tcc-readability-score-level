Alternative rock is a type of rock music that became popular in the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s. Alternative rock is made up of various subgenres that have come out of the indie music scene since the 1980s, such as grunge, indie rock, Britpop, gothic rock, and indie pop.
These genres are sorted by their collective types of punk, which laid the groundwork for alternative music in the 1970s.
