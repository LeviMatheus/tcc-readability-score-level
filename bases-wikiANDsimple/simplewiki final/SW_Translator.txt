A translator reads something written in one language and speaks it or writes it in another language. For example, they could read a book in French and then "translate" it into English. See translation for more information.
In order to convert meanings from one language into another one, translators must be able to know deeply about the target culture, so that they are effective in conveying the original meaning of the source text or material. As a result, translators do not only convert words, what makes it deeper than a science but an art.
Translation is a complex activity, mainly because to interact and to communicate between languages require more than fluency in the source and the target languages but flexibility between them in an effective way for a specific audience or special readers. It is a sort of occupation and career that is mainly based on research and great skills for languages.
