In anatomy, the dorsum is the upper side of animals that can run, fly, or swim in a forwards and backwards direction, and the back side of animals (like humans) that walk upright. In vertebrates the dorsum contains the backbone. The term dorsal means the parts that are either located toward or grow off that side of an animal. The opposite side of the animal is described with the terms ventrum and ventral.
In humans, the top of the foot is said to be dorsal.
Examples of "dorsal" are the dorsal fin of fish, dorsal root ganglion, dorsal root, dorsal nerve, dorsum sellae, dorsal arch, dorsalis pedis artery, dorsal ramus, dorsal scales of snakes, dorsal respiratory group, dorsal venous arch, and dorsiflexion among others.
