Ulster is one of the four provinces which make up Ireland. The others are Leinster, Munster and Connacht.
There are nine counties in Ulster. Three are in the Republic of Ireland. The other six make up all of Northern Ireland.
The name "Ulster" is also sometimes used to mean "Northern Ireland", even though Northern Ireland is only part of Ulster.
