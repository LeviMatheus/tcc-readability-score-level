In 1878 it became controlled by Austria-Hungary when the Empire took over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908. In 1914 the Archduke Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie Chotek, were killed in Sarajevo, leading to World War I. From 1918 until 1992, the country was a part of the former Yugoslavia. After a big war, Bosnia and Herzegovina got independence as a country with many different peoples, languages and religions.
