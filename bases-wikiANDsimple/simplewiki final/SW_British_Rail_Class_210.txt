The British Rail Class 210 was a type of Diesel-electric multiple unit built in the late 1970s. The class was intended to be a modern DEMU to replace the ageing types in use on the Southern Region of British Railways but the prototypes built did not manage to secure production for the class and they were withdrawn in the 1980s.
