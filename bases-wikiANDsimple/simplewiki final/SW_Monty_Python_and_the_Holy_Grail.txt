"Monty Python and the Holy Grail" is the second movie made by Monty Python. It was made in 1975 and was very successful. It is still very popular. It was also made into a musical called "Spamalot".
Story.
This is a comedy about King Arthur's search for the Holy Grail. He gathers a group of knights around him. They do not ride horses - instead they clap coconut halves together, to make the sound of a horse galloping. They search for the grail, but keep on getting distracted by peasants (poor farmers) who want to talk about politics, or French knights insulting them.
The film was made in Scotland.
