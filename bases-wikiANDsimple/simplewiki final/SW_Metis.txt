Metis is the goddess of wisdom in Greek mythology. She is one of the Titans and is the daughter of Oceanus and Tethys. She was the mother of Athena.
There is also a moon named after Metis.
Athena's Birth.
There are many stories about Athena's birth. In Hesiod's "Theogony", Zeus had sex with Metis, but was then scared of her having a child becase a prophecy had said that Metis would have children who were more powerful then Zeus. To try and stop Metis having a child, Zeus changed her into a fly and then swollowed her. However, Zeus was too late and Metis was already pregnant.
When she was inside Zeus, Metis made a helmet and a robe for her baby. The hammering noise caused Zeus to have a headache. To try and help Zeus with the pain, Prometheus, Hephaestus, Hermes, or Palaemon (depending on the myth) cut his head open with a Minoan axe. Athena then came out of Zeus's head. She was fully grown and had her armour on.
