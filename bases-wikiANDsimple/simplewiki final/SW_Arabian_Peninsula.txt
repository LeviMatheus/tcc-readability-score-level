Arabia is a peninsula in Southwest Asia at the junction of Africa and Asia. It lies east of Ethiopia and northern Somalia; south of Israel, the disputed Palestinian territories, and Jordan; and southwest of Iran.
The peninsula has sometimes been called the Middle East, but that term usually refers to the Arabian Peninsula plus the Levant, and Mesopotamia. The term "Arabia" often refers to Saudi Arabia alone.
The country of Saudi Arabia covers almost all of Arabia. The majority of the population of the peninsula live in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
