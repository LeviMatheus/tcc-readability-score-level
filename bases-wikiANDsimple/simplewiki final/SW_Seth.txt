In Egyptian mythology, Seth (also spelled Sutekh, Setesh, Seteh, Set) was a god. He was the god of the desert, one of the two biomes that makes up Egypt. The other biome is the small area on both sides of the Nile where farmers grow crops.
The word 'Seth' was first said as 'Set'. Because of changes in the Egyptian language over the 3,000 years that Seth was worshipped, by the Greek period, the t in Set was pronounced so similarly from 'th' that the Greeks wrote it as Seth.
