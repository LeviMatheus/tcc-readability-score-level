Medical stress can be defined as change in body's normal internal balance which leads to a number of hormonal and neurological responses so that normal balance is restored.Stress can result from both internal factors(arising within the body)or external stimuli.These factors can be both positive(e.g. birth) or negative(e.g.heavy drinking).In normal parlance the word "stress" basically refers to psychological stress and stress management refers to life-style strategies aimed at controlling such psychological factors which alleviate stress producing stimuli.Though one or other form of stress is an everyday occurrence which can be considered as a part normal biological existence,stress in excess can lead to multitude of problems.Certain disease conditions are also identified with stress such as "Post traumatic stress disorder"- a psychiatric condition resulting from sudden exposure to excessive stress producing external stimuli such as major accident.
