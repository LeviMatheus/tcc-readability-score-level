In volcanology, magma is melted rock that is under the ground. It is like lava, which is melted rock above the ground. There are many types of magma. One is called felsic magma. Felsic magma is thick and has lots of something called silica. It mostly makes light-colored rocks. Another type is called mafic magma, which is runny and has less silica. It usually makes dark-colored rocks. A third type is intermediate magma. It is like both the other types.
