Interharmonics are ratios between one harmonic and another. For example, 12/9 or 1.3333 is an interharmonic between the fundamental frequency (or first harmonic) and the second harmonic. Interharmonics relate to wave motion harmonics, in any form of radiant energy. Wave motion harmonics are waves added to a fundamental wave having a frequency that is a whole multiple (an integer) of the fundamental frequency. The second harmonic has a frequency twice that of the fundamental, the third harmonic three times, and so on. Interharmonics is a term invented, or at least standardised, by the international electronics industry about 1999, particularly for use in electrical energy. However, interharmonic frequencies also occur naturally in other radiant energies, for example music or any type of sound.
