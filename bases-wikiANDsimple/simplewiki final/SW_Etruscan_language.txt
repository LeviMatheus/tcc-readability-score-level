The Etruscan language was spoken and written by Etruscan civilization in the ancient area of Etruria (modern Tuscany plus western Umbria and northern Latium) and in parts of Lombardy, Veneto, and Emilia-Romagna (where Gauls took the place of Etruscans), in Italy.
Inscriptions have been found in north-west and west-central Italy, in the region that even now has a name that came from the Etruscans, Tuscany (from Latin "tusc" "Etruscans"), as well as in today's Latium north of Rome, in today's Umbria west of the Tiber, around Capua in Campania and in the Po valley to the north of Etruria. This is probably the area in Italy where the language was once spoken.
