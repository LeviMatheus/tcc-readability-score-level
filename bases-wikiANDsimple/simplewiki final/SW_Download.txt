Download means getting information from another computer or server. The opposite of downloading is uploading, which is sending data to another computer. Usually we do not say "download" for a single web page (for example when you open this page on your computer). When we say we downloaded something, it is normally a bigger piece of information, like data or a computer program.
The word downloadable means the ability to get information or data from a primary source for one's use. The source is expected to be authentic and patent. At the user's end, the downloaded information or data are to be used based on agreement notice.
In the 21st century, it is very easy to download information from the internet. Many people make the mistake of downloading illegal files from the internet.
