An independent movie, or independent film (often called indie film), is the name usually given to a film that is made by a small movie studio for not much money. Sometimes the name is used for art films; which are less expensive and often have less plot. Independent movies are being made (produced) more as the technology needed, such as cameras and editing-software, is becoming less expensive. Movies like Reservoir Dogs, American History X, The Basketball Diaries and the documentary Bowling for Columbine are independent because they were made for little money and by small studios.
