"Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends" is a children's cartoon that is shown on Cartoon Network. It was created by Craig McCracken, who also made "The Powerpuff Girls". It premiered in August 2004, and new episodes are created to this day. In the show's world, imaginary friends are as real as humans. Once the creator decides he or she does not want the imaginary friend anymore, they are sent to live at "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends," an adoption home.
In the ninety-minute debut episode, an imaginary friend named Bloo is allowed to live in the house without being available for adoption, as long as his creator Mac visits him every day. The show from this point onwards is about their many silly adventures with their new friends, both imaginary and human.
