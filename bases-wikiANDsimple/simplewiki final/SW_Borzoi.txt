It is about 30 - 32 inches (75-80cm) tall at the withers (its back near the shoulders). It weighs between 75 and 85 pounds (35 to 40kg). They can be any color from solid white to brown and white, gray and white or brindle. They can also be all black. People who look after Borzois have done an good job of stopping health problem. Borzois do not have many of the problems other breeds have.
In Russia, they were well liked by the royalty. It was illegal to sell them. They were given to those who did something special for the Tzars. They feature in Russian novels e.g. in Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina". During the Russian revolution, most of the breed were killed because they were a symbol of royalty. A few were taken from the country.
They have been used in advertising for luxury cars and jewelry. This is because of their elegant looks.
