In chemistry, valence electrons are the electrons in the outside or "valence" electron shell of an atom. Valence electrons are important in how a chemical element reacts with other elements. If an atom does not have many valence electrons, it is more likely to react with another element. If the atom has more valence electrons, it is less likely to react.
