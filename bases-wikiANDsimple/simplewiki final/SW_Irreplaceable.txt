Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Espen Lind, and Amund Bjørklund for Knowles' second studio album, "B'Day" (2006). Produced by Norwegian production team Stargate and Beyoncé, the song was released as the album's third single domestically, and the second single outside North America in October 2006. The track "Freakum Dress" was initially the third single for US single and the second international single, however due to the underperformance of the single "Ring The Alarm" "Irreplaceable" was rush released because of its high popularity. "Irreplaceable" reached number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100 on December 16, 2006, making it Beyoncé's eighth "Billboard" number-one, and her fourth as a solo artist (her first without a guest rapper).
