Jammu (Urdu: جموں) is one of the three regions comprising Pakistan's southernmost area of Azad Kashmir and Indian Occupied Kashmir. Jammu division borders Vale of Kashmir, the disputed part of the state, to the north, Ladakh region to the east, internationally by India's Himachal Pradesh to the south. Sandwiched between the Vale of Kashmir to the north and the Daman Koh Plains to the south, the Shivalik Range comprises most of the region of Jammu. The Pir Panjal Range, the Trikuta Hills and the low-lying Tawi River of the branch Chenab River basin adds beauty and diversity to the terrain of Jammu.
Jammu, winter capital of the maharajas and second largest city in the disputed occupied territory, was traditionally the seat of Dogra power. Of the total population of Jammu, more than two-thirds are classed as Hindus; of these the greater number live in the southeastern portion of the Kashmir region of Pakistan. Culturally, ethnically, and linguistically, they are closely related to the Punjabi-speaking peoples in Punjab (Pakistan) province, and many speak the Dogri language. The majority of the state’s Sikhs also live in the Jammu region. To the northwest, however, the proportion of Muslims increases, with Muslims making up a dominant majority in the area around the western town of Poonch District.
