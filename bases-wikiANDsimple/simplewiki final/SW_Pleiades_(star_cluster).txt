The Pleiades (also known as M45 or the Seven Sisters) are a cluster (group) of stars in the night sky. You can see them in the constellation (pattern of stars) called Taurus, the bull. An astronomer named Charles Messier gave it the designation (name) M45. They are named after the Pleiades in Greek mythology.
