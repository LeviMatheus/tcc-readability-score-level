The Tomb of Maussollos, Mausoleum of Maussollos, or Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (Ancient Greek:), was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC. It was built at Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus Artemisia II of Caria, his wife and sister. He was a satrap in the Persian Empire. It was designed by the Greek architects Satyrus and Pythius. It stood about 45 meters (135 feet) tall. Each of the four sides was decorated with sculptural reliefs created by one of four Greek sculptors — Bryaxis, Leochares, Scopas and Timotheus. It was such an accomplishment that Antipater of Sidon said it was one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The word "mausoleum" has come to be used generically for any grand tomb, though "Mausol" – "eion" originally meant "[building] dedicated to Mausolus".
