Johannes Kepler (lived December 27, 1571 â€“ November 15, 1630) was a German astronomer. He was Tycho Brahe's apprentice, or person who learns a trade from another person. Tycho Brahe looked at the way the planets moved in the sky. This motion is very complex. Johannes Kepler found a simple way to say how the planets move.
Laws which say how the planets move.
A planet moves along a path called an orbit. Kepler used three laws to say what form the path has and how fast the planet moves.
