Byzantine art means the art of the Eastern Roman Empire from about the 5th century until the Fall of Constantinople in 1453. (The Roman Empire during this period is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire.)
But the term can also be used for the art of states at the same time as the Byzantine Empire which had a common culture with it, such as Bulgaria, Serbia, or Rus; and also for the art of the Republic of Venice and Kingdom of Sicily, which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire though they were part of western European culture as well. Art produced by Balkan and Anatolian Christians who lived in the Ottoman Empire is often called "post-Byzantine." Certain traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in Greece, Russia and other Eastern Orthodox countries till now.
