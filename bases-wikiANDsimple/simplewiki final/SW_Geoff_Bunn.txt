Geoff Bunn is an English artist. He was born in Birmingham, England in 1963. He has been in galleries such as the Tate but is better known for putting his work in the ordinary environment rather than 'ordinary' art galleries. He worked in France, for a time, with the recently deceased painter Fred Yates.
