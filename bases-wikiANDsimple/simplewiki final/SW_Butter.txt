Butter is a dairy food product, made by churning the cream obtained from whole milk. It is commonly used as a spread on bread and a main ingredient in biscuits, as a shortening agent in some baking and cooking recipes, and sometimes as a frying medium.
Butter is nearly pure fat, so margarine, which has less fat and cholesterol, might be a heathier choice for some people. It also is usually cheaper.
