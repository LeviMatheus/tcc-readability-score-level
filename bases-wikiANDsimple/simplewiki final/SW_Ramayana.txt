There are different views about the time of writing of the Ramayana. Some people believe that it was written 2,500 years before. Some others think that it was written only around 1,800 years before. All agree that the book is very old and was written before the Mahabharata.
The Ramayana is still very popular today. Every autumn the "Ramlila" ("Rama play") is performed at the festival of Dassehra. A huge model of Ravana is set alight. This symbolises the triumph of light over darkness.
