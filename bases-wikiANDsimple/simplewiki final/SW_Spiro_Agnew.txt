Spiro Theodore Agnew (November 9, 1918â€“September 17, 1996) was the 39th Vice President of the United States. He served under President Richard M. Nixon. He was also the 55th governor of the state of Maryland and the first Greek American governor in United States history.
He is most famous for his resignation in the summer of 1973 after he was under investigation for the crime of extortion, tax fraud, bribery, and conspiracy. In October he was charged with having taken bribes a little more than $100,000 while in office.
Agnew is the only U.S. Vice President in history to leave office because of criminal charges. Ten years later, in January 1983, he paid the state of Maryland almost $270,000 as a result of a civil suit that came from the bribery allegations.
