Delara Darabi (دلارا دارابى) (born September 29, 1986) is a Iranian girl, who was sentenced to death at age of 17 and is facing execution by public hanging. She was convicted for murder, despite her highly probably innocence.
Delara's sentence was upheld by Iran's Supreme Court. The only person who could commute the sentence is Iranian Head of Judiciary, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi.
In January 2007, Delara attempted to commit suicide.
Delara is kept in Rasht Prison. According to her family and attorney, her health condition is not good. She was severely beaten by prison guards and fellow prisoners and left with a broken arm. Conditions in prison are extremely poor, leading Delara to repeatedly file requests to be transferred to another prison with better sanitary and overall conditions. Her requests have not been answered.
Delara is also a talented painter, poet and pianist. Her paintings were exhibited in Tehran and, recently, in Amsterdam.
