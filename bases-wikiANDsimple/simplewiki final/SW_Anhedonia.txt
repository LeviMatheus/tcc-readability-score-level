In psychology, anhedonia (< Greek αν- an-, "without" + ηδονή hēdonē, "pleasure") is not finding happiness or pleasure in events that are normally pleasurable. This may include things like eating, exercise, and social or sexual interaction.
Anhedonia is often a symptom of depression. It is also a symptom of schizophrenia and other mental disorders.
