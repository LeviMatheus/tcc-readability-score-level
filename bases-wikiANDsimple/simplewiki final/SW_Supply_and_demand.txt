Supply and demand is a model of microeconomics. It looks at how a price is formed. This is done because producers and consumers interact with each other. This will fix the price for a certain type of good. In Perfect competition the quantity demanded (demand) and the quantity supplied will be equal. This will fix the price. There will be economic equilibrium.
It was Alfred Marshall who first described the model.
