Surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the mid-1920s. It is best known for the art and writings of the group members. The works have the element of surprise, unexpected items being placed next to each other for no clear reason. Many Surrealist artists and writers see their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost. The works are an artifact, and leader Andr√© Breton said that Surrealism was above all a revolutionary movement. From the Dada activities of World War I Surrealism was formed with the most important centre of the movement in Paris. From the 1920s it spread around the globe. It influenced films such as the Angel's Egg and El Topo.
