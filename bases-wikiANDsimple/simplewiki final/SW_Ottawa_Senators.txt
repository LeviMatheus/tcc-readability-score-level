Ottawa Senators is the name of two teams that have played ice hockey in the National Hockey League (NHL).
The first team, then known as the Ottawa Silver Seven, won the Stanley Cup in 1903. In those days, other teams could challenge for the cup at any time. The Silver Seven won nine challenges, keeping the cup until 1906. The team changed its name to Senators, and then won the cup again in 1909, 1911, 1920, 1921, 1923, and 1927. Its star players included goaltender Clint Benedict, and forwards Cy Denneny and Frank Nighbor. The team moved to St. Louis in 1934, where they played for one year.
The current Ottawa Senators began playing in 1992. They won the President's Trophy as the top team in the regular season in 2002-2003. Some of their best players have included Daniel Alfredsson, Alexei Yashin, Marion Hossa, and Dany Heatley.
