Niue is an island country in the south Pacific. It is commonly known as "Rock of Polynesia". It has its own government, but it is an associated state of New Zealand. This means that Niue's head of state is New Zealand's sovereign (queen) in right, and most diplomatic relations are conducted by the latter on Niue's behalf.
The territory is located 2,400 kilometres north-east of New Zealand in a triangle between Tonga, Samoa, and the Cook Islands.
