The National Hockey League's Pacific Division is one of three divisions that make up the Western Conference. It was formed in 1993 as part league realignment. The Pacific Division is the successor of the Smythe Division, though of the current teams, only the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks played in the Smythe division.
The Pacific Division is centered around the Southwestern United States, with three teams based in California, one in Arizona and one in Texas.
The Dallas Stars have the most Pacific Division titles, with five. Three Stanley Cup winners have come from the Pacific Division: the Stars in 1999, the Colorado Avalanche in 1996, and the Anaheim Ducks in 2007.
1993–1995.
When the Pacific Division was formed in 1993, it was identical to the Smythe Division, except that the Winnipeg Jets moved to the Central Division, and the expansion Mighty Ducks of Anaheim joined.
In addition to the Ducks, the Pacific featured the Calgary Flames, Edmonton Oilers, Los Angeles Kings, San Jose Sharks and Vancouver Canucks.
The Flames were the first team to win a Pacific Division title, capturing it in both 1993–94 and 1994–95.
1995–1998.
The Pacific was expanded to seven teams in 1995 with the relocation of the Quebec Nordiques to Denver, Colorado as the Colorado Avalanche. The Avs won the division title all three years they were in the Pacific, along with becoming the first Stanley Cup champion to represent the Pacific in 1996.
1998-present.
In 1998, the NHL once again realigned, moving to a six division format. As a result, the Flames, Avalanche, Oilers and Canucks were split off into their own division, the Northwest Division. At the same time, the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona to become the Phoenix Coyotes. Finally, the Dallas Stars moved in from the Central Division, giving the Pacific the alignment it retains to this day.
