A reference is something that can be "referred" to, or something used to check things. An encyclopedia like Wikipedia is a fine example of something that could be used as a reference. A software manual or the instruction book for a car are other examples of references.
Sometimes the word reference is used to mean "I looked this up, here:" followed by the book and page number or the web page where the information was found.
