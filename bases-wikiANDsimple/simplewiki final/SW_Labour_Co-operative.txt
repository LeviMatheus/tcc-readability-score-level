Labour Co-operative or Labour and Co-operative is the name used in the United Kingdom to describe politicians who are elected as members of the Co-operative Party.
The electoral agreement between the Labour Party and the Co-operative Party says that the Co-operative Party candidates must be members of the Labour Party as well.
