A right is a thing which people think we should not let people take away from other people.
Many people say that we have a "right to life". That means that other people cannot kill us because that is taking our lives away. Also we may have a "right to property". That means that people cannot steal things that are ours.
If you have a right, it only means that other people cannot take that thing away from you. It does not mean they have to give it to you. It does not mean they have to help you get it.
In many countries people have a "right to free speech" which means other people cannot stop them saying what they want to. But if they go to a television studio and say they want to speak on the television, the owner of the television studio can say no. This is because he is not taking anything away from them. He is choosing not to give them something. Also if they are in another person's home and you they something they do not like, the owner of the home can ask them to leave, because although they have a right to free speech they do not have a right to be in another person's home.
