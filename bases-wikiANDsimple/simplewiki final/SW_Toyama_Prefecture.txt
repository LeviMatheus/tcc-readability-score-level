Industry.
Toyama has one of the strongest industrial prefecture on the Japan-sea coast, companies were historically taking advantage of cheap electricity generated from its rich water with 3000-meter class mountains. The Itai-itai disease, its origin is from polluted water with cadmium, occurred in Toyama around 1950.
Nowadays, electricity is not surprisingly cheap, because they mainly use oil to generate it. But Aluminum industry is still strong with companies such as YKK or Sankyo Aluminum.
