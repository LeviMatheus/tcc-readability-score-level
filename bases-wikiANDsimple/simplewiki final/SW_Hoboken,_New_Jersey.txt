Early history.
Hoboken was an island, by the Hudson River to the east. To the west was a swamp near the Palisades on the west. Hoboken was a campsite by the Lenni Lenape. Then Hoboken became bad and there was war and disease. Europeans came in the 17th century. The name Hoboken comes from the original Lenape name for "Hobocan Hackingh" or "land of the tobacco pipe."
The first European to find Hoboken was Henry Hudson. He stopped his ship near Weehawken Cove on October 2, 1609. Three Native Americans sold Hoboken to Michael Paauw, Director of the Dutch West India Company on July 12, 1630. The first European settlers of Hoboken were Dutch farmers. Hendrick Van Vorst of Jersey City leased the land to Aert Van Putten, who was Hoboken's first person. In 1643 Van Putten built a farm house and brew house north of Castle Point. The brew house was America's first.
The land was taken by William Bayard. Bayard, who liked the revolutionary cause, changed to a Loyalist Tory in 1776 after New York ended. At the end of the Revolutionary War, Bayard's land was taken by the Revolutionary Government of New Jersey.
The nineteenth century.
After the American war for independence, Hoboken was bought by Colonel John Stevens in 1784 for about $90,000. In the early 19th century, Stevens made the waterfront better for Manhattan people. He tested his inventions. Later in the century, Hoboken became better by being a shipping port and industrial center. Hoboken became a city in 1855, and Cornelius V. Clickener became the first Mayor. By the 19th century, shipping lines were using Hoboken as a port, and the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad (later the Erie Lackawanna Railroad) had became a railroad center at the waterfront.
In 1832, a cave called Sybil's Cave opened and was popular. At that time, Hoboken was not yet an industrial city, and Hoboken was a country spot. Sybil's Cave was used in one of Edgar Allan Poe's stories in 1841. The water in the cave was bad, so the cave closed in the 1880s, and in the 1930s it was filled with stone. David Roberts, the mayor of Hoboken, will re-open the cave for the first time in over 60 years.
Hoboken was new and the people grew. They got many jobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Hoboken Land and Improvement Company, started by Colonel Stevens in 1838, created many streets, began housing, and created building sites. The housing was made up of masonry of three to five stories. Many buildings survive to the present day, and the street grid. It was also at this time that German immigrants became the main group in Hoboken. Along with the main industry of creating ships, well-known industries that created a big presence in Hoboken were Maxwell House, Lipton Tea, and Hostess, among others. In 1870, the Stevens Institute of Technology was created at Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken.
"Heaven, Hell or Hoboken.".
World War I changed Hoboken. People against Germans started the city being placed under law, and many Germans had to move to Ellis Island in nearby New York Harbor. Or they left the city. During the war Hoboken became famous. In Hoboken terminal, American troops got onto ships that went to Europe. More than three million soldiers went through the terminal, and their word phrase was "Heaven, Hell or Hoboken... by Christmas."
Interwar years.
After the war, Italians were the city's major group, with the Irish having being a big group.
Post World War II.
In the 1960s, other people followed, including Puerto Ricans. Even though new residents came, Hoboken got very bad. In the middle of the 20th century, industries looked for greener areas, port jobs went to larger places in Newark Bay, and the car, truck and airplane relpaced the railroad and ship as the way of moving in the United States. Most of the ports closed around 1975.
In the 1970s and 1980s, Hoboken changed itself by letting in artists, musicians, and young and happy people were going into Manhattan for work. Making Hoboken better was done in the same way as in the Manhattan. Making Hoboken better has continued, with many new places to live now being built on what used to be industrial sites on the waterfront and even more so in the western parts of Hoboken that were wost for the longest time. Poolitical control of the city is mostly controlled by the city's long-term residents because the new people seem to have less interest than do the long-term residents. The City of Hoboken is controlled by the Faulkner Act (Mayor-Council).
In the Hoboken election of 2005, 5 people tried to be mayor: David Roberts, Carol Marsh, Frank "Pupie" Raia, Michael Russo, and Evelyn Smith. There are 15 people trying to be in the council with the people who want to be mayor, and 2 trying to be in the council alone.

Character.
In the 20th century Hoboken sank from its earlier incarnation as a lively port town into a severely rundown condition. It was often included in lists with other New Jersey towns and cities that had seen much better days, such as Paterson, Elizabeth, and Camden. Heaps of uncollected garbage and roving packs of semi-wild dogs were common sights. Then, in the late 1970s, it began a surprising rejuvenation that led to its becoming, by the mid-1990s, easily one of the state's most vibrant communities.
The city today is noted for its excellent views of Manhattan, fine-grained street grid, historic architecture, and lively collection of restaurants and bars. Its compactness and historic street layout mean that a car is more of a hindrance than a help in getting around, and the city retains a basic pedestrian orientation. On weekend nights the town swells with young partygoers from nearby New Jersey towns who practice a rowdier style of barhopping than is fashionable across the river in Manhattan. Hoboken pockets their liquor money and quiet Sundays see families and artsy types back in possession of streets and parks.
Hoboken's gentrification has become relatively advanced, though a large base of native residents remains in the city and holds political power. The population of "newcomers" or "yuppies", as they are typically called in the local press, consists of college and post-graduate students, bi-nationals, older artists and, increasingly, well-to-do commuters to Manhattan. The presence of these individuals gives Hoboken a unique energy and a growing reputation as a desirable place to live. However, the rising cost of living in the town, particularly in rental units, has already resulted in a significant exodus of the "bohemian" population that was responsible for turning the city's reputation around.
Waterfront.
The Hoboken waterfront is the western shore of the Hudson from Newark Street to Stevens Institute of Technology, sandwiched by the Holland Tunnel to the south and Lincoln Tunnel to the north, directly across from Lower Manhattan's Canal Street. The waterfront defined Hoboken as an archetypal port town and powered its economy from the mid-19th century to the outbreak of World War I, when the federal government seized most of it under eminent domain. Control of the waterfront was returned to the city in the early 1950s. "On the Waterfront", consistently listed among the five best American films ever, was filmed here, dramatically highlighting the rough and tumble lives of dockworkers and the infiltration of unions by organized crime. Today the waterfront is cherished for its scenic views of the Hudson and Manhattan, accessible to all by professionally landscaped parks built on the foundations of former piers (Pier A, Pier C, Sinatra Park and Pier 14).
