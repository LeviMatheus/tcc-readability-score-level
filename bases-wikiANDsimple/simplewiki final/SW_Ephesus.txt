The City of Ephesus was a big city in the ancient world. It was important mainly because of its artificial harbor. The city had a magnificent temple built about 500 BCE for the worship of the goddess Artemis, whose statue dominated the temple. The majority of Ephesians worshipped her, and visitors came from far and wide to worship in the temple. Silver statues of Artemis were common in houses within the city. Residents of the city were called Ephesians. The Apostle Paul is said to have addressed an epistle to the Christians of the city. His letter is is now known as the book Ephesians in the New Testament.
