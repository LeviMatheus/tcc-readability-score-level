The fundamental theorem of algebra is a proven fact that is the basis of mathematical analysis, the study of limits. It was proven by German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. It says that for any polynomial formula_1 with the degree, or highest power, of "n", where "n">0, formula_2 must have exactly "n" complex zeroes. A zero is a solution to a function for which the number "x" gives formula_3. Some of these zeroes may be the same. All polynomials also have at least one zero that is distinct, which means that there is at least one zero that is different from any other zeroes of that function. Many people say that the theorem's name is wrong because it is used more in analysis than algebra.
