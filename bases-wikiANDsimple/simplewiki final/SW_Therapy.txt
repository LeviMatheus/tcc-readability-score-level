Therapy, in the medical field also called treatment, is what people do to try to solve or care for a health problem, physical or mental. When a person is ill or injured, a doctor may make a diagnosis and then recommend a therapy to try to make the person well. The therapy can be, for example, medicines (drugs), surgery or a change of diet.
