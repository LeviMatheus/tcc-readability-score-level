The Alpine Lynx is a breed of domestic cat. Some people say that Alpine Lynxes have bobcat (a wild cat) genes, but
scientists say that this is not true. They are of medium length for cats. Their hind legs are longer than their front legs. Their toes may have tufts of fur on them.
Males are bigger than females. They may also take longer to reach maturity. Their heads are large, with wide set large eyes. Their ears can be either stright or curled. The tail may be short, like that of the bobcat. It may also be completely absent, like in the Manx cat. Their coat is always white.
