QuikTrip (abbreviated QT) is a Tulsa-based chain of convenience stores mainly found in the Midwestern and Southern United States (not to be confused with Kwik Trip convenience stores).
The first QuikTrip opened in 1958 in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Chester Cadieux and Burt B. Holmes. QuikTrip promotes its gasoline as "high-quality" and offers a money-back guarantee.
