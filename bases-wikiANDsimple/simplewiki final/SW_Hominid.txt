A hominid is any member of the biological family Hominidae (the "great apes"). That includes the extinct and currently existant humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. This classification has been revised several times in the last few decades. These various revisions have led to a varied use of the word "hominid": the original meaning of Hominidae referred only to the modern meaning of Hominina, that means only humans and their closest relatives. The meaning of this taxon changed. The modern meaning of "hominid" includes all great apes.
Certain morphological characteristics are still used conventionally to support the idea that hominid should only mean humans and human ancestors, namely bipedalism (walking on two feet) and large brains. These points of departure between human beings and the other great apes are important, but according to genetically based taxonomic classification, are not enough to divide us into separate families. Genetics, rather than morphology, is more widely accepted as the critical standard. Many scientists, including anthropologists, use the term to mean humans and their direct and near-direct bipedal ancestors.
