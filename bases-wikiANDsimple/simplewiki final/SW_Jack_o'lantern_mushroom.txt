The jack o'lantern mushroom is an orange-red gilled mushroom that looks like the chanterelle and emits light. Unlike the chanterelle, the jack o'lantern mushroom is very poisonous. While eating this mushroom will not kill you, it may cause cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. This mushroom smells and looks very appealing, so there are reports of repeat poisonings from individuals who were tempted to try them a second time.
Description.
The Jack-o-Lantern mushroom's fruiting body (its stem and cap) is an orange color. It grows only in October and November, around Halloween. Underneath the cap is its well-known glowing color, which glows in a lime green color. This mushroom is asexual.
