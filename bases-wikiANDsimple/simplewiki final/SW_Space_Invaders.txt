Space Invaders is a video game made by the Taito Corporation. Space Invaders is one of the most famous early video games. The game is about protecting the Earth from the Space Invaders by controlling by shooting them all before they can land. There have been seven versions of Space Invaders made by the Taito Corporation. Space Invaders was designed by the Taito Corporations man in charge of the game making department, Mr Toshihiro Nishikado. Mr Nishikado was inspired to make the game after watching Star Wars and War of the Worlds. At first Space Invaders was a coin-operated machine but has been made available for almost every games console and home computer. Before making Space Invaders, Mr Nishikado worked on games called Soccer and Interceptor. He says the hardest part of making a video game is designing the computer inside it. Taito describes Space Invaders as "an international phenomenon".
