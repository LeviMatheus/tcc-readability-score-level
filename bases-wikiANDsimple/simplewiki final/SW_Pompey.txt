Pompey, Pompey the Great or Pompey the Triumvir (Classical Latin abbreviation: CN·POMPEIVS·CN·F·SEX·N·MAGNVS Gnaeus or Cnaeus Pompeius Magnus) (September 29 106 BC–September 29 48 BC), was an important military and political leader of the late Roman Republic.
Coming from an Italian provincial background, he got a place for himself in the ranks of Roman nobility, and was given the cognomen of "the Great" by Lucius Cornelius Sulla.
Pompey was a rival of Marcus Licinius Crassus and an ally to Gaius Julius Caesar. The three politicians would dominate the Late Roman republic through a political alliance called the First Triumvirate. After the death of Crassus, Pompey and Caesar would dispute the leadership of the entire Roman state.
