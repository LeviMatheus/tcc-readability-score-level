The First Triumvirate is the name most historians give to the political alliance between Gaius Julius Caesar, Marcus Licinius Crassus and Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus. They made it to give each other power. Each person helped the others to be more powerful. It was unofficial and spectacular. (The Second Triumvirate was official yet unspectacular.) It was made in 60 BC. It finished with Crassus' death in the year 53 BC. Then Caesar and Pompey started fighting. Caesar won at the Battle of Pharsalus.
Then Caesar became dictator in the year 44 BC.
