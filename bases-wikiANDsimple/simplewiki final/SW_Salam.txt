Salam or salaam (in Arabic language: سلام "salam") is an Arabic word that literally means "the peace", but is also used as a general greeting, abowe all in Arabian countries and by the Muslims, but also in other countries where Islam is important.
This word appears also in longer greetings, as "assalamoe `alaykum" (السلام عليكم) to which it is possible to answer: "wa`alaykum assalam". In addition, "As-Salam" is one of the 99 Names of God.
The Hebrew version is "shalom", that in Israel is used in the same way like "salaam".
