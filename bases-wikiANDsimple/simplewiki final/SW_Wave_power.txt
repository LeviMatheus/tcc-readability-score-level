Wave power means the energy of ocean surface waves and the capture of that energy to do useful work - including electricity generation, desalination, and the pumping of water (into reservoirs).
Power from ocean surface wave motion might produce much more energy thantides. It has been tested that it is possible to produce energy from waves, particularly in Scotland in the UK. But the technology is not as well developed as wind power or solar power.
