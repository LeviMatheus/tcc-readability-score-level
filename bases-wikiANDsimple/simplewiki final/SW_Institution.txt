An institution is social structure in which people cooperate and which influences the behavior of people and the way they live.
Some societies have many institutions in the "specific" sense. These societies have an organised government, schools, hospitals, churches, clubs, armies, markets, courts and places for entertainment. Some societies have very few of these things, but this does not mean that there are no "institutions". The way in which the people relate to each other may have just as many "controls" as in a society with schools, markets and a government. An example of a society that has lots of "specific" institutions is Western Europe. An example of a society with very few specific institutions is the society of the Australian Aboriginal people before the 20th century.
Historians look at institutions to find differences between eras or periods. They sometimes judge political and military events by the effect that they had on institutions.
