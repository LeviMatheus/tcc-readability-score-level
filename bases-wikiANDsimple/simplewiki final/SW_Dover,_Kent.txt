Dover History.
The Romans first tried to invade Dover in 55BC, under Julius Caesar, but were forced back by the Celts, who fiercely defended their coastline. It was not until 43 AD, under the rule of Emperor Claudius, that Roman forces successfully landed on British soil at Richborough and took control of the land as far as the northern border. Dover, then called DVBRIS, became the Roman's most important naval town.
