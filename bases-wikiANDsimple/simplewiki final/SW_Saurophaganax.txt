Saurophaganax ("lizard eating master") is a genus of theropod dinosaur. Saurophaganax may be a really big allosaur. This dinosaur might have been a huge meat-eater, possibly reaching 50 feet (15 m) long. Very little of its fossilized bones have been found so scientists are still deciding what to call this dinosaur.
