Almondvale Stadium is a football stadium in Livingston, West Lothian. It is the home of Scottish First Division club Livingston F.C..
The stadium, which used to be called the "City Stadium" because of a deal with the City Group, was built in 1995. It had also previously been called the "West Lothian Courier Stadium". Since the club was taken over by the Lionheart Consortium, it was changed back to its original name, Almondvale Stadium.
It is hired by Livingston FC from West Lothian Council every year. As Livingston moved up the divisions into the top flight of Scottish Football, they expanded the stadium to meet Premier League standards.
