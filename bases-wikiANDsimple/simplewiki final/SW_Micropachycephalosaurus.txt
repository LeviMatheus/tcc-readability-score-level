Micropachycephalosaurus (meaning "Tiny Thick Headed Reptile") was a small herbivore dinosaur from the Late Cretaceous. It was the smallest dinosaur ever discovered, only 0.5 meters long, but it has the longest name of any other dinosaur. Before it was discovered Compsognathus was considered as the smallest dinosaur. It lived in China during the Late Cretaceous.
