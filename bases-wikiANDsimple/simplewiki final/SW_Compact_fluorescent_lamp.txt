A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL), is a type of lamp (light bulb) designed to fit into the same space as an incandescent bulb, but with the advantages of a fluorescent lamp. Many CFLs can directly replace an existing incandescent lamp.
The purchase price of a CFL is often much higher than an incandescent lamp of the same output, and the light from CFLs looks different to light from incandescent lamps. But CFLs have a longer rated life and use less energy. A CFL can save over US$30 in electricity costs over the lampâ€™s lifetime compared to an incandescent lamp.
How it works.
Electrodes at each end of the junction of the coiled tube to the base emit electrons. These electrons strike the electrons orbiting a nucleus of mercury vapor. This interaction causes the electron of the mercury atom to fall into a lower shell, releasing a photon which is ultraviolet light. This photon strikes the phosphorescent coating on the tube, which then is visible as visible light.
