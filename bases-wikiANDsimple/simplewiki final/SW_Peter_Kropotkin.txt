Prince Peter (Pyotr) Alexeyevich Kropotkin () (9 December 1842 - 8 February 1921) was one of Russia's most important anarchists and one of the first advocates of anarchist communism. Because of his title of prince and his fame as an anarchist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, he was known by some as "the Anarchist Prince".
