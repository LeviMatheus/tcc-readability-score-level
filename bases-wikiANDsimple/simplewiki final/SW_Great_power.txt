A Great power is a nation or state that is able to influece other states in a large part of the world. That is possible as it has great economic, political and military strength. Its opinions are taken into account by other nations before taking diplomatic or military action. Characteristically, they have the ability to intervene militarily almost anywhere, and they also have soft, cultural power, often in the form of economic investment in less developed portions of the world.
