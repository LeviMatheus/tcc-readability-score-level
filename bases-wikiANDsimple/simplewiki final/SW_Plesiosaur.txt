Plesiosaurs were large, meat-eating reptiles that lived in water. They were around from the start of the Jurassic period, and lasted until the end of the Cretaceous. They had two pairs of flippers, short tails, long necks, and broad bodies.
The Loch Ness Monster is said to be a plesiosaur, but from what scientists have found plesiosaurs have been extinct for millions of years.
