Atlantic hurricane seasons
Pre-1600 1600s/1610s 30s 50s
The decades of the 1600s and 1610s featured the 1600â€“1619 Atlantic hurricane seasons. While info for every storm that happened is not available, some parts of the coastline had enough people to give info of hurricane happenings. Each season was an ongoing event in the annual cycle of tropical cyclone formation in the Atlantic basin. Most tropical cyclone formation occurs between June 1 and November 30.
