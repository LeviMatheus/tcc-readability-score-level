Noob is a slang term for a new person in a community, group, or video game, and especially on the internet (see internet slang). "Noob" is short for "newbie", another slang term that comes from the word "new". A noob usually means a bad player in a game, or someone who does not know the rules of a community. Being a noob is usually not a good thing.
In many Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG)s or other internet based games, the word noob is used very often. Noob can also mean someone that has a high level, but is not a skilled player. A person new to a game is often referred as a Newbie. The word can also be used to talk about a young player.
However lots of places (mainly internet forums and online games) use the word 'noob' differently to the word 'newb'. Where a 'newb' or 'newbie' is simply someone who is new to the forum/game/etc..., and a 'noob' or 'n00b' is someone who has no respect for the rules, does not want to do anything for themselves and generally acts like an idiot. So 'noob' has become an offensive term in a lot of places on the internet. To behave like a noob will often mean getting disrespect and lack of interest from other players. Once a the noob status has been initiated, you're a noob for life.
Noob's are usually referred to by the 1337 (pronounced "leet") or skilled players, who have marginally higher experience in the game.
The word "noob" or "newbie" originated in World War II. It was a word veterans used to describe new recruits.
Recently "noob" is used mainly just as a name to refer to other player's in various games (FPS, TPS, RPG, etc.) It's usually a derogatory term, but can be exchanged as a friendly greeting.
Also, noob is used as the meaning "a person who does not know anything".
A noob is sometimes confused with a "choob" (a person with nice things but has a low skill level).
