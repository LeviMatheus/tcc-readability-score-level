Sustainable energy involves both energy efficiency and renewable energy. Both resources help to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Efficient energy use allows energy demand to slow so that rising clean energy supplies can make big cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.
Any serious vision of a sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.
