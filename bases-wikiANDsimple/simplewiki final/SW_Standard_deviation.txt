Standard deviation is a concept from statistics. It tells how the values are grouped around the mean. It is the average of a set of numbers' difference from the mean.
Method.
Standard deviation can be used to evaluate the precision or consistency of a set of data. Standard deviation can also produce standard error, which is useful in statistical inference.
Example.
To find the standard deviation of the numbers 3, 7, 7, and 19.
Step 1: find the mean of 3, 7, 7, and 19
Step 2: find the deviation of each number from the mean,
Step 3: square each of the deviations
Step 4: find the mean of those squared deviations
Step 5: find the square root
So, the standard deviation is 6.
