A Readability test is a way to measure a text for how easy it is to read. There are different kinds of readability tests. They look at different things in a text, like how long the words are or how long the sentences are. A test uses a mathematical formula to find a number which says how easy it is to read the text. If two different tests look at the same things about a text, one test can use a different formula than the other test.
