"Nine in the Afternoon" is the first single from the second album by Panic at the Disco, "Pretty. Odd." The music video was filmed on December 20 and December 21. It was the first song written after the band decided to erase several worth of an album they had been planning on releasing in the fall of 2007. Panic at the Disco's first performance of "Nine in the Afternoon" was at Virgin Festival 2007.
