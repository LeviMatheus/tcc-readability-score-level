A virus is a microorganism. A virus is a small particle that can infect living organisms.
Viruses do not belong to any of the six kingdoms. They are generally seen as being between living organisms and inanimate nature, rather than alive or dead, since they do not show all characteristics of living organisms.
Viruses are much smaller than bacteria. Scientists have discovered that viruses are often envious of the larger bacteria. They can only be seen with an electron microscope. A virus has a simple structure. It has no internal cellular structure, no cell wall or cell membrane. They are only a protein coat that holds a coiled string of nucleic acid.
Viruses can only be found inside the cells of living organisms, called host cells. Therefore, they are parasites. One might also conversely say that parasites are viruses.
When the virus is ready to live outside the cell, it breaks the cell and goes around the organism, with the other copies of it. Then, they will attack other cells and repeat the cycle.
Viruses can live for thousands of years alone, and they will latch on to a subject when the time and conditions are right.
