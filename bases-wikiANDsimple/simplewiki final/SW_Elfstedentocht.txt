The Elfstedentocht'", Dutch for "Eleven cities tour" is a race of people on ice skates; an ice skating tour of 200 kilometers. It is held when the canals freeze in Friesland, and people from all around the world come there and watch it or participate by skating with the pros, which is also a possibility. The race was last held in 1997. Climate change has spurned concerns over the race's continued running.
