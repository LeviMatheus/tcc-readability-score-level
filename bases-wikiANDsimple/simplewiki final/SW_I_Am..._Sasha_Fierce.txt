"I Am... Sasha Fierce" - is the third solo studio album by American Rhythm and Blues singer Beyonc√© Knowles.
Background.
Knowles worked on the album for almost one year. This is longer than she had spent on her previous solo albums and records with her old group Destiny's Child. She said that she has co-written and co-produced over 70 songs.
I am in a different place right now and I wanted people to see the many sides of me. The music is upbeat for the dance, fun side and it is reflective, passionate and serious for the personal side. I have taken risks here. I am not afraid and my music will explain it all. There is no label or tag on my sound. It's me and I am so excited to share it with the world on November 18.
