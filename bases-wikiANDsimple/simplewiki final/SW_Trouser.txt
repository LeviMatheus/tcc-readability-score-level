Trousers (or pants in Canada, South Africa and the United States, and sometimes called slacks or breeches (sometimes)) are a kind of clothing worn on the lower part of the body, covering both legs apart (instead with cloth stretching across both as in skirts and dresses). Historically, as for the West, trousers have been the lower-body clothing item for males since the 16th century; by the late 20th century, they had become prevalent for females as well. Trousers are worn at the hips or waist, and may be held up by their own by a belt, or suspenders (braces).
