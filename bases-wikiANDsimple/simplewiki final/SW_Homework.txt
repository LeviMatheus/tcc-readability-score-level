Homework is school work that students are given at school to do at home. Homework is usually given to students by the teachers. It is a practice work which helps students review what they've learned that day. Homework also helps to make students remember what they learned better. Some students will get more homework and some will get less. This depends on how old they are and how intelligent they are.
