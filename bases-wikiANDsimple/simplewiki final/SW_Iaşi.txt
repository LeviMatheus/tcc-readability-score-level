Iaşi is a city in the northeastern part of Romania. It is the second largest city in Romania as of the year 2007. Iaşi used to be the capital of Moldavia.
History.
Alexandru Lăpuşneanu changed the capital of Moldavia from Suceava to Iaşi in 1564. One of the first churches to be built in Moldavia was built by the Greek adventurer Prince Ioan Iacob Heraclid.
The Tatars burned the city down in 1513. The Ottoman Empire also burned the city down in 1538 and people from the Imperial Russian army did so again in 1686. As if that weren't enough for the people of Iaşi, the plague spread throughout the city in 1734.
The Russo-Turkish War of 1787 was stopped when the Peace of Iaşi happened. Alexander Ypsilanti and the Filiki Eteria came into the city and took it in 1822.
Iaşi was the capital of Moldavia from 1568 to 1859. When World War I happened, Iaşi became the capital of Romania. This happened when the Central Powers took Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Bucharest became the capital again when Imperial Germany was defeated.
Geography.
Iaşi can be found on the Bahlui River, which is a tributary of the Jijia. Forests and uplands are very common. These woods and hills include the monasteries of Cetăţuia, Frumoasa, and Galata. People have thought that Iaşi was built on seven hills (Cetăţuia, Galata, Copou-Aurora, Bucium-Păun, Şorogari, Repedea and Breazu in Romanian).
