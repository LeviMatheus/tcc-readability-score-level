Diplomacy is when countries make agreements with each other, or when they do not. Diplomacy is the talking of one country or more than one country with another country. Sometimes these talks are about trade or business, and sometimes they are about war and peace. Diplomacy happens a lot when two countries or more fight. Diplomats help to stop fighting between these countries.
