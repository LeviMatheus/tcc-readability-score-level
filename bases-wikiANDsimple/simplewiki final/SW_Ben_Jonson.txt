Ben Jonson (11 June 1572 â€“ 6 August 1637) was a major poet and playwright in English Renaissance drama. Many critics consider Jonson to be among the best playwrights of his time, when William Shakespeare also lived. He is perhaps best known for two comedies, his plays "Volpone" and "The Alchemist".
Jonson is buried in Westminster Abbey.
