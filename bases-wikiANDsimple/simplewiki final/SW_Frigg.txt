Frigg (or Frigga) is a goddess in Norse mythology. She is Odin's wife. She is the goddess of marriage, motherhood, managing the household, and keeper of the domestic arts. She has the power of prophecy, but she does not tell what she knows. Her children are Baldr, Höðr and, in an English source, Wecta; her stepchildren are Hermóðr, Heimdall, Tyr, Vidar, Váli, and Skjoldr. Thor is either her brother or a stepson. Frigg's companion is Eir, the gods' doctor and goddess of healing. Frigg's attendants are Hlín (a goddess of protection), Gná (a messenger goddess), and Fulla (a fertility goddess). It is unclear whether Frigg's companions and attendants are simply different aspects of Frigg herself (cf. avatar). According to the poem "Lokasenna" Frigg is the daughter of Fjorgyn (masculine version of "Earth," cf. feminine version of "Earth," Thor's mother), her mother is not identified in the stories that have survived.
In the poem Lokasenna, Loki insulted all the gods and goddesses. To Frigg, he said that she had sexual relationships with Odin's brothers, Ve and Vili, when Odin was away.
Frigg is the foremost goddess of the Æsir, she is often confused with Freyja, foremost goddess of the Vanir.
Friday, the day of the week is named either after her or after Freyja.
