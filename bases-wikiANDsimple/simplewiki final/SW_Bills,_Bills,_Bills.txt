"Bills, Bills, Bills" was the first single (music) from Destiny's Child's second album "The Writing's on the Wall". A track which echoed the men-bashing sentiments of TLC's massive summer hit "No Scrubs", and even featured the same producer (Kevin She"kspere Briggs). The song provided the group with their first US chart-topper in July 1999, and also reached the UK Top 10. The album featured a greater creative input from the group, although they still relied on a production crew including Rodney Jerkins, Missy Elliott, Chad Elliot, and Dwayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni! Tone!
