132 Aethra is a M-type main belt asteroid. It was found by James Craig Watson in 1873. It has a rather eccentric orbit that sometimes brings it closer to the Sun than the planet Mars. It was the first such Mars-crosser asteroid to be found.
The changing light curve of the asteroid means that it has a stretched or non-spherical shape for its body.
It is named after Aethra, the mother of Theseus in Greek mythology.
