Alberto Vargas (1896-1982) was a Peruvian-born painter, best known for his pin-up paintings of beautiful women.
A painting of Alberto's "Varga Girl" was put on the Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album. She is pictured in the upper right-hand corner (next to Richard Menkin the man in the hat).
