Oviraptor was a dinosaur from what is today Mongolia. Scientists think it lived 75 million years ago. An Oviraptor could run as fast as an ostrich. It could perhaps run about 43 mph (70 km per hour). Oviraptor was a large-brained dinosaur that cared for its eggs. In 1924, an Oviraptor fossil was found on top of some eggs and people thought that it had been eating the eggs. Other people thought that the fossilized Oviraptor was probably a parent of the eggs in the nest, and not an egg stealer but a nurturer.
