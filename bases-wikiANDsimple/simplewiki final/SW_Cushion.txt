A cushion is a soft bag of material, filled with wool, hair, feathers, or even paper in small pieces. It may be used for sitting on to make a chair or couch more comfortable. Cushions can be used for body support. Cushions and rugs can used outside, to make hard ground softer. Cushions can be used to decorate and brighten up boring places. Cushions can come in many different shapes and sizes, but the most common shape of a cushion is a square or rectangle, like a pillow.
