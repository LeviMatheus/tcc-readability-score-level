Convergent evolution is a term from biology. It describes when two species which are not directly related by evolution develop the same traits. This happens because they live in similar habitats, and have to develop solutions to the same kind of problems.
As an example, the wings of insects, birds and bats are very similar (Those of pterosaurs too, but pterosaurs are extinct, so this is harder to see). All wings have the same function, and their structure is similar. Despite this, these wings evolved independently of each other.
Another example is the lens of the eyes of different animals. The striking similarities between hummingbird moths and hummingbirds is another example of convergent evolution.
