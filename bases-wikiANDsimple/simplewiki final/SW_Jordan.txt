Geography.
Jordan has borders with the countries of Saudi Arabia, Israel, Syria and Iraq. It also has a very short coast on the Red Sea, and a longer coast along the Dead Sea.
Most of Jordan is desert and the country is very dry. The northwest of Jordan is its highest part, and its lowest part is the Dead Sea. This is, in fact, the lowest place on the Earth that is open to the sky.
The capital of Jordan is Amman.
Culture.
People from Jordan are called Jordanians. Most of them speak Arabic as their first language. The population of Jordan is about 5.7 million people.
Jordan is a democracy, and the Jordanians vote for their political leaders. However, Jordan is also a monarchy and has a king. The King is the head of state, but he does not have all the power in the country. King Abdullah has been the King of Jordan since February 1999. Most Jordanians are Muslim. There is a small number of Christians.
Economy.
Unlike some of the countries around it, Jordan has little petroleum and natural gas. Some of its economy comes from mining instead.
The currency of Jordan is called the Jordanian dinar.
