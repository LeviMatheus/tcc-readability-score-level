History.
The Scottish Cup started in the 1873-74 season, and 16 teams played to try to win it. The trophy was first won by Queen's Park when they beat Clydesdale 2â€“0 in the final in front of a crowd of 3,000 people. While the FA Cup is the oldest cup competition in the world, the trophy awarded to the Scottish Cup winners is the oldest trophy, being minted in 1885.
