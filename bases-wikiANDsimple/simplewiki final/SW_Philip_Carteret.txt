Philip Carteret (January 22 1733 - July 21 1796) was an English officer in the Royal Navy. He sailed as a lieutenant on John Byron's circumnavigation (sailing around) of the world in 1764. He went around the world again as part of the Royal Navy's exploration in 1766.
Discoveries.
On circumnavigation Carteret in "HMS Swallow" accompanied Samuel Wallis who sailed in the "HMS Dolphin". The 2 ships were separated sailing around Cape Horn, so Carteret continued on alone. He discovered Pitcairn Island on July 2, 1767. He also discovered the Carteret Islands, Mururoa, and the Duke of Gloucester Islands. He got back to England in 1769. The Swallow was in bad condition and the success of the long trip shows Carteret's courage and skill.
Carteret's health was ruined by his voyage of exploration. He was put on half pay, and in 1773, he wrote the story of the voyage as part of a book about the voyages of Byron, Wallis, Carteret and Cook. The book's editor John Hawkesworth made changes to his account and so Carteret wrote his own book which was only published in 1965. In 1779 he took the ship "HMS Endymion" to the West Indies. This was his final trip. He was promoted to Vice-Admiral and he retired to Southhampton in 1794.
