An electron microscope is a microscope that uses electrons. Electron microscopes are very powerful and can see very small objects, like cells in the body.
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM).
It is the original form of electron microscope. High voltage electrons are sent from a cathode towards the specimen. Part of the electrons passes through the specimen, and is collected by a detector. The image is then created using a computer. This image shows the internal structure of the specimen.
Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).
High voltage electrons are sent towards the specimen. The specimen sends back low voltage electrons, which are collected by a detector. The image shows the characteristics of the "surface" of the specimen.
Reflection Electron Microscope (REM).
High voltage electrons are sent towards the specimen. Part of the electrons is reflected (sent back), which is collected by a detector. The resulted image shows the characteristics of the surface of the specimen.
Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope (STEM).
It combines the high resolution of TEM with the rastering functions of SEM. It can be used to perform complex analyses on the specimen, which cannot be done using TEM alone.
