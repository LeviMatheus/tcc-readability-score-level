Hydraulics is a topic of science and engineering subject dealing with the mechanical properties of liquids.
One of the founders of modern hydraulics was Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo Galilei.
Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on the engineering uses of fluid properties.
