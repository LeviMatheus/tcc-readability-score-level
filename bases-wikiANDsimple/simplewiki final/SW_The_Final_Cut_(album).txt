"The Final Cut" is a rock album by Pink Floyd recorded at various studios in the UK from July to December 1982. It is the final Pink Floyd studio album to feature the band's bassist and primary songwriter Roger Waters. The album is predominantly the work of Waters, this being the only Pink Floyd album on which the composers' credit on every track is given to Waters alone. Keyboardist Rick Wright played no part in the recording of "The Final Cut" having been sacked by Waters during recording of "The Wall", meaning that this is the only Pink Floyd album on which Wright does not feature at all. David Gilmour meanwhile sings lead vocals on only one of the album's twelve songs, the rest being sung entirely by Waters. The recording of "The Final Cut" was marred by tension between Waters and his bandmates, particularly Gilmour, who has since expressed his dislike for much of the album. For these and other reasons, it is sometimes regarded as a Roger Waters solo album rather than a true Pink Floyd album. None of the album's songs has ever been performed live by Pink Floyd, though some have been performed live by Waters during solo tours. Waters' dominance on the album is most clearly seen on the back cover, which reads: "The Final Cut: A Requiem for the Post-War Dream - by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".
