A person is in shock when blood is not sufficient to bring oxygen to the brain. The shock is progressive and can be lethal if it is not promptly made well.
The normal first aid action is the "Trendelenburg position", the person is laying face upward, with his legs lifted. The blood is forced to flow to the brain.
