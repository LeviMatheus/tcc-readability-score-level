GameSpot is a website that was created in June of 1996 by Pete Deemer, Vince Broady and Jon Epstein.
In the beginning the website was mainly about PC games. Another similar site, videogamespot.com was created in December of the same year to talk about console video game systems. In 1997, videogamespot.com became videogames.com for a short time. Afterwards in 1998, videogames.com and gamespot.com joined together to become a single site.
GameSpot makes video game and PC reviews, previews, downloads, news, and information. It is known as one of the biggest game websites on the Internet. ZDNet bought Gamespot later on. However ZDNet was later bought by CNET Networks, so now GameSpot belongs to CNET.
On October 3, 2005, GameSpot changed how the website looked, making it similar to what TV.com looks like..
