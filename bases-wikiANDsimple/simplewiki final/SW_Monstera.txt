Monstera is a genus of flowering plants. There are about 31 species in the genus. The genus belongs to the family Araceae. Originally, the plants occur in the tropical regions of Central and South America.
The plants are evergreen vines. They climb other trees. They can grow to a height of about 20m. The plants also have aerial roots. These can act as hooks on branches of the tree that the plant is climbing. They can also grow into the ground to support the plant. The leaves are leathery, and dark green. They are special in that they have holes in them. The flowers grow on a special structure called spadix. Some species have edible fruit.
Many people grow some of these species (esp. "Monstera deliciosa") indoors as a houseplant. "Monstera deliciosa" is sometimes also grown for its fruit, which tastes somewhere between a banana and a pineapple.
In some parts of the world (other than Tropical America), some plants started to grow in the wild. This is the case for example in Portugal, on Madeira, Morocco, some parts of India and Malaysia as well as in Florida.
