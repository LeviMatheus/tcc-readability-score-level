The clitoral glans (glans clitoridis) is a part of the clitoris found on the outside of the vagina.
Anatomy.
The clitoral glans is covered by the clitoral hood, which is attached to the labia minora. The whole structure is attached to the frenulum clitoridis and clitoral body (which is internal).
Physiology.
The glans (head) of the clitoris is about the size and shape of a pea. It is highly sensitive because it has lots of nerves around and on it for arousal. During arousal, the glans fills with blood.
