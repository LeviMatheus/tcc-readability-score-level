MacGyver, a reference to someone who is able to perform amazing feats with the use of very few and often irrelevant objects. This term comes from the TV show "MacGyver," which was first shown in the September of 1985 on the television network, ABC. The main character, Angus MacGyver (Richard Dean Anderson), often prevented inevitable defeats, saved lives, distracted enemies, made weapons, and even performed everyday tasks usually using very few objects that seemed irrelevant or abnormal to use in such situations. His use of duct tape has led some parts of the world to call it "MacGyver tape."
