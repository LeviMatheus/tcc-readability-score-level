Soggy biscuit (also called limp biscuit, or ookie cookie) is a masturbation game played mostly by teenage groups in which the participants stand around a biscuit masturbating until ejaculating onto it; the last person to do so must eat the biscuit. The term is thought to have originated in Australia sometime in the 1960s.
Although the way its spelled may differ slightly, the notability of the game is shown by the variations on the being referred to in popular culture, examples including Stephen Fry's "The Liar", the German movie "Crazy" and Skinless's song "Scum Cookie".
