History.
Opera was first started in 1994 at Telenor, which is Norway's largest telecommunications company. In 1995 it became its own company called Opera Software ASA.
Until version 2.0 Opera was called MultiTorg Opera and was not available to the public. It was known for its multiple document interface (MDI) and 'hotlist' (sidebar), which made browsing several pages at once much easier, as well as being the first browser to completely focus on adhering to the W3C standards.
