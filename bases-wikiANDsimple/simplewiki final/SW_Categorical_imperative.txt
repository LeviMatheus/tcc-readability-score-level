The categorical imperative is an idea that Immanuel Kant had about ethics. An 'imperative' is something that some person has to do. The categorical imperative says that we should act in ways that we wish that every person would act. Kant thought that another way of saying the same idea is to say that we should treat other persons as persons and not as tools that can help us in some way.
Kant thought that this idea is the basis to treat other people in the right way.
