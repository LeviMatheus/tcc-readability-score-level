"Love In This Club Part II" is an R&B-Pop song written by Amber Rives and Usher,and recorded by Usher for his album Here I Stand. The song features Beyonc√© and Lil Wayne, and it is a remix of the original song, but the structure and lyrics of the song are completely different from the original: "Love in This Club", so the song's name was changed to "Love in This Club Part II".
