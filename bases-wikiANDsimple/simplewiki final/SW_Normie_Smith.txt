Norman "Normie" Smith (March 18, 1908 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada – February 21988) was a Vezina-winning goaltender for the Detroit Red Wings. Smith did not let in a goal by the Montreal Maroons in the NHL's longest game, a 176-minute, 30-second game, on way to a Stanley Cup championship in 1936. After suffering an arm injury, his quality of play dropped in 1937–38 and the Red Wings finished last. During a game in 1939, he didn't show up, causing problems with Jack Adams. Normie Smith retired rather than report to the minor leagues. He returned to play briefly with the Detroit Red Wings when World War II left a vacuum of players in the NHL.
