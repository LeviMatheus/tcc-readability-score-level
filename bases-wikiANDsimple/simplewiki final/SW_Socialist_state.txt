A Socialist state, sometimes (though incorrectly) known as a communist state, is a country that practices a form of government where property is owned by the state. Many socialist states refer to themselves as "communist countries", though communism, a classless society in which the people in common control property, is not the system that these states operate by. Some states practice certain forms of socialism, such as Leninism or Maoism.
