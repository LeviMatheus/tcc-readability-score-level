Tanakh is an acronym that is the same thing as the Hebrew Bible. It has three parts called the Torah, which has the first five books, the Nevi'im, which has the books of Hebrew prophets, and the Ketuvim, which has the rest of the books. It takes its name from the first two letters of each of these parts.
