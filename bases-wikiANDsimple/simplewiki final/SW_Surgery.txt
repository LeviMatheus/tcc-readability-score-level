Surgery is an operation that involves a doctor. The doctor helps their patients by taking out, changing or fixing parts of the human body. Doctors who study surgery are called surgeons. All surgeons are an expert in an area of their choice, for example a surgeon that operates on bones is called an orthopaedic (orth-o-pae-dic) surgeon.
Surgery (operations) can be very simple, like taking a tooth out. Surgery can also be very complicated, like surgery to remove a cancer.
Operating rooms have to be very clean places. The doctors and nurses go to great lengths to keep the room clean where the surgery is done. Regular cleaning of the room and its tools is done to keep everything clean and germ-free.
Everyone in the operating room must wear special clothes, hats, shoes, gowns, gloves and masks that are clean and germ free. The surgeons wear green scrubs. The only people allowed in the operating rooms are the doctors and nurses as well as the patient too.
When people have operations they are normally put to sleep with anaesthesia. When the patients are asleep, they cannot feel anything.
In recent years, many patients that cannot get the required surgery in their own country, or find the costs too high, travel to another country for medical care. This is called Medical Tourism.
