Leonhard Euler (pronounced "Oiler") (April 15, 1707 – September 7, 1783) was a Swiss mathematician and physicist. He spent most of his life in Russia and Germany.
Euler made important discoveries in fields like calculus and topology. He also made many of the words used in math today. He invented the idea of a mathematical function. He is also known for his work in mechanics, optics, and astronomy.
Euler is considered to be the most important mathematician of the 18th century and one of the greatest of all time. He is also one of the mathematicians who wrote the most. His collected works fill 60–80 volumes. Another mathematician, Pierre-Simon Laplace said, "Read Euler, read Euler, he is a master for us all".
Euler was featured on the sixth series of the Swiss 10-franc bill and on numerous Swiss, German, and Russian postage stamps. The asteroid 2002 Euler was named in his honor. He is also celebrated by the Lutheran Church on their Calendar of Saints on May 24.
