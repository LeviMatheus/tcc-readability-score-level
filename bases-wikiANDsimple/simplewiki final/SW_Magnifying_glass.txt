A magnifying glass is a lens through which you can look to make things appear bigger, so you can see them better.
The magnifying glass consists of a piece of convex-shaped glass or plastic. It has to be held at the right distance between the eye and the object. The magnifying glass usually comes with a handle. A telescope is a more advanced kind of magnifying glass and consists of at least two glass lenses.
A pair of binoculars is like a telescope for each eye. "Spectacles" or eyeglasses also use lenses to correct a person's vision.
