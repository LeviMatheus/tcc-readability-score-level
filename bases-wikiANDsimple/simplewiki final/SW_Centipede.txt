A centipede is an arthropod with many legs. Centipedes are predators. They hunt during the night, they are nocturnal. Some centipedes are venemous, though none can kill a human that is not allergic. Centipedes are among the fastest moving arthropod predators that cannot fly. Centipedes are in the class Chilopoda, and related to millipedes, which are not poisonous. As the mililpedes, they are very segmented. They have between 5 and 173 segments, but only one pair of legs per segment.
The house centipede is a carnivore that feeds on cockroaches, house flies and other domestic pests. It is therefore beneficial. But because it has a scary appearance it is often exterminated.
