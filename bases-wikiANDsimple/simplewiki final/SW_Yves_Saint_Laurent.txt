Yves Henri Donat Mathieu Saint Laurent (August 1, 1936 â€“ June 1, 2008) was a French fashion designer. He is considered to be 'one of the greatest figures in French fashion in the 20th century' (Daily Telegraph 2/6/08) In 1985, in her book, "Couture: The Great Fashion Designers", Caroline Rennolds Milbank wrote, "The most consistently celebrated and influential designer of the past twenty-five years, Yves Saint Laurent can be credited with both spurring the couture's rise from its Sixties ashes and with finally rendering ready-to-wear reputable".
