The Airbus A380 (also called "Superjumbo" or "A3XX") is a 4 engined, double-deck aeroplane built by Airbus. It is the biggest passenger aeroplane in the world, larger than a Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet. However, it is not the biggest aeroplane in the world (the Antonov An-225 is the biggest in the world).
The Airbus A380 can carry between 550 and 850 passengers, and weighs over 250 tonnes. It is powered by 4 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines or 4 Engine Alliance GP7000 engines (The companies General Electric and Pratt & Whitney make Engine Alliance engines).
Orders.
A total of 198 A380-800 aeroplanes have been ordered by 14 airlines, 1 by Prince Al-Walid bin Talal (who is a Prince in Saudi Arabia) and 10 by a company called ILFC (who give other airlines aeroplanes for rent). Some airlines also ordered the A380-800F, an A380 that carries cargo, not people. But, because Airbus took too long to make the A380, orders for the A380-800F have been cancelled.
Emirates Airlines (an airline from the United Arab Emirates) will have the most A380 aeroplanes because they have ordered 58, but so far they only have 4.
Singapore Airlines (an airline from Singapore) took delivery of the first A380, which flew to Sydney in Australia on 25 October 2007. Singapore Airlines now have 6 A380s and are still waiting for 13 more.
Other airlines whom have ordered the A380 are Qantas (from Australia), Air France (from France), China Southern Airlines (from China), Lufthansa (from Germany), Kingfisher Airlines (from India), Korean Air (from South Korea), Thai Airways (from Thailand), Malaysia Airlines (from Malaysia), British Airways (from the United Kingdom), Qatar Airways (from Qatar), Eithad Airways (from the United Arab Emirates) and Virgin Atlantic (from the United Kingdom).
