Blaze Starr and the Governor.
When Blaze Starr first met Governor Long in 1958, her first feeling was
fear. She was afraid she was going to jail when the Governor of Louisiana walked in with the police during a dance. When the Governor and the police gave Blaze a standing ovation, she was dumbfounded. Blaze had never known a politician who went to a show bar for any reason other than to cause the dancers trouble. After her show, the Governor asked for her to come to his table. They became friends.
Their relationship quickly grew into a love affair. Soon coworkers, reporters, and voters all knew of the affair. Mrs. Blanche Long, the Governor's wife told hospital people that Earl was crazy and had him put away. She thought this would make Earl to end the affair with Blaze. The affair continued until the day Earl died in 1960.
Her life was exciting and full of adventures. In the 1950's, stripping was more of an art form. It was not just women taking off their clothes to get men into bed. Blaze was close to her family. Blaze met her perfect match when she met Earl. He accepted her life style and she accepted his. They fulfilled each other's needs for companionship, compassion, and love.
