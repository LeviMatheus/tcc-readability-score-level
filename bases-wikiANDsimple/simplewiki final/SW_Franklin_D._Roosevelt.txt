Franklin Delano Roosevelt (January 30, 1882 - April 12, 1945) was a Governor of New York and the 32nd President of the United States.
Early political career.
Roosevelt was the Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Woodrow Wilson. He was nominated the vice presidential candidate under James M. Cox in 1920. Cox and Roosevelt lost to Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge.
Roosevelt was elected the Governor of New York in 1928.
Presidency.
Roosevelt was elected to be president in 1932, against incumbent (sitting president) Herbert Hoover, who was very unpopular because of the Great Depression. Roosevelt led the United States through the Depression, and was very popular. He started a series of popular programs known as the New Deal, which attempted to reverse the effects of the Great Depression. Because of this, he was re-elected in a landslide victory in 1936. He was re-elected two more times (in 1940 and 1944) and led the U.S. through World War II.
He contracted a crippling form of polio, a disease which makes it hard for people to use their muscles. His wife Eleanor Roosevelt nursed him back to health to the best of her abilities. Unfortunately, he ended up never having the use of his legs again.
While still president, he died April 12, 1945.
