The flag of the United Arab Emirates (Arabic: علم الإمارات العربية المتحدة) is used to represent, or show, the United Arab Emirates. It contains the Pan-Arab colors, which are red, green, white, and black, to show Arab unity. The green stands for fertility, the white means neutrality, or being neutral, and the black stands for the country's large amount of oil.
Some merchants also fly a civil flag, which is red with the regualr United Arab Emirates flag in the top-right.
