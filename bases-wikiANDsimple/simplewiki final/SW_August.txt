August is the eighth month of the year. It has 31 days.
This month was first called "Sextilis" in Latin, because it was the sixth month in the old Roman calendar. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with Romulus. It was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King Numa Pompilius about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the decemvirs about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree).
August is named for Augustus Caesar. The month has 31 days because the Roman senate wanted as many days as Julius Caesar's month July. Augustus is in summer, after July and before September.
An extra month was moved from February in order to make the of August seem more important. This was undone when the leap year adjustment was made.
August's flower is the Gladioli with the birthstone being Peridot.
