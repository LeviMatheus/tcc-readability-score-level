A trophy is an object given to someone because of an accomplishment. These are often given out through sporting events.
A trophy can be in the shape of a cup, a bowl, a mug (these usually painted or engraved with something), a human shape (like the Emmy Award), or a spaceship (like the Hugo Award for science-fiction).
Trophies can also be an animal head. These are often taken as trophies by hunters.
In ancient times people would take heads or other body parts of enemies they had killed in a battle to show how good a warrior they were.
