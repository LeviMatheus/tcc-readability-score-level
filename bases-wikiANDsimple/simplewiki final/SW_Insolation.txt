Insolation is the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface. It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimetre per minute.
Insolation affects temperature. The more the insolation, the higher the temperature.
In any given day, the strongest insolation is received at noon.
The longer the duration of daylight, the more the insolation received.
