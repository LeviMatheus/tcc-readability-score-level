Compul√∂sory sterilization is a term used for laws that say that certain groups of people should be serilized so that they can no longer have children.
Such laws were mainly introduced because of Eugenic views of the start of the 20th century. Today, most compulsory sterilizations are done to mentally ill people who are not able to handle a pregnancy on their own. In China, compulsory sterilization is part of family planning.
