Windows NT is a series of Microsoft's Windows operating systems that were the first to use their new 'NT' (New Technology) kernel. That meant it had a brand new kernel to do more things than the MS-DOS-based kernel that they used in older versions of Windows. The new kernel meant that Windows was more secure and crashed less.
Versions of Windows NT are Windows NT 3.1, NT 3.51, NT 4, Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista.
