Different aspects of meaning.
Several parts of meaning may be called denotation. That depends on the contrast being drawn.
In logic and semantics, denotational always attracts the extension meaning "in the pair", but the other element genuinely varies. See intension for some more discussion.
A denotation is the strict, literal, dictionary definition of a word, devoid of any emotion, attitude, or colour.
Denotation often links with symbolism, as the denotation of a particular media text often represents something further; a hidden meaning (or an Engima Code) is often encoded into a media text (such as the images below).
