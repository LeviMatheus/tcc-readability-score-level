Transistor–Transistor Logic (TTL) is a class of digital circuits built from transistors, and resistors. It is called "transistor–transistor logic" because the logic function (e.g., AND) is performed by transistors. There are a lot of integrated circuit with TTL technology. They are used in many applications such as computers, industrial controls, test equipment and instrumentation, synthesizers, etc.
