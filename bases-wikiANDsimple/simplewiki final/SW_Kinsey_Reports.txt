The Kinsey Reports are two books, published in the late 1940s and early 1950s by Alfred Kinsey and others. In the books "Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male" (published in 1948) and "Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female" (published in 1953), Kinsey looks at different sexual behaviours and sex practices.
The books were very shocking when they came out, as they talked abuot subjects that were taboo. It also questioned widely-held beliefs about sexuality. They were controversial.
Criticism.
People said that the selection of those asked was not well done. One in four were prisoners, and 5% were male prostitutes. The institute, or location Kinsey did these tests, then did another such tests, without asking prisoners or prostitutes, and the findings were more or less the same. People also say that child abuse may have been involved when collecting the data.
Kinsey Scale.
The Kinsey scale attempts to describe a person's sexual history or episodes of their sexual activity at a given time. It uses a scale from 0 to 6. "0" means the person tested is exclusively heterosexual. A person scoring "6" is exclusively homosexual. In the "Kinsey Reports", an extra grade was used for asexuality. The scale was first published in "Sexual Behavior in the Human Male" (1948). It was also important in the complementary work "Sexual Behavior in the Human Female" (1953).
