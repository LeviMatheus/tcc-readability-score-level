Malnutrition is when a person does not get the nutrition they have to have to survive. It is considered a more scientific and official term than "starvation," which has negative associations.
Malnutrition is not, however, simply not eating enough. You can be malnourished if you eat the wrong balance of foods - too much sugar or not enough vitamins.
