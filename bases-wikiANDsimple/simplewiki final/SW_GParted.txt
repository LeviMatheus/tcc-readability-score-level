GParted is a program used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying partitions, and the file systems on them. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems (works with Vista System & Data partitions), reorganizing disk usage, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).
