The Chinese dragon is a mythical animal. A dragon is not a true animal, but an animal found in stories told a very long time ago.
A dragon is also a powerful symbol (an idea as a picture). It means power and that good things will happen.
Dragons are often found in Chinese art and stories. Since people found dragons in Chinese art and stories, dragons are sometimes thought of as a symbol for China. But inside China, the people now want the Giant Panda as a symbol for China. This might be because dragons were also symbols for emperors of China long ago.
