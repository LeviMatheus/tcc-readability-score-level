Study of the human body.
Some people study the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other animals' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be extinct animals like other hominids. (Hominids are primates that are close to humans. Neanderthals and "Homo erectus" were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its environment. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body.it has many senses which can let him fell pain or other things

The human body and other animals.
Scientists think that the human body is very much like other animals. They see that some human "behaviors" are like animal behaviors. (Behaviors are the way an organism acts.) They know that 98% of the DNA in humans is the same as other primates.
The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the chimpanzee. 98.4% of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees.
