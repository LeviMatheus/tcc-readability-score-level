Quinine () is an alkaloid which can reduce fever, work against malaria and pain and swelling. The bark of the Chinona family of trees contains Quinine. Quinine can be made artificially, but this is more expensive than extracting it from the bark of the tree.
Quinine was the first treatment for Malaria, from about the 17th century. Even today, Quinine is used to treat cretain forms of Malaria, when other drugs fail or are unavailable. In that way, Quinine is currently one of the best treatments for Malaria tropica, which is caused by plasomdium falciparum. for the other forms of Malaria, Quinine is no longer used, as other drugs have taken over.
History.
Quinine relaxes muscles, and was used by the Quechua Indians of Peru to stop people from shivering.Quinine was first used against malaria in Rome in 1631.
The best type of quinine used to treat malaria was found by Charles Marie de La Condamine in 1737. Quinine helped Europeans colonize Africa. A historian said that "it was quinine... that gave colonists fresh opportunities to swarm into the Gold Coast, Nigeria and other parts of west Africa".
Side effects.
Quinine can cause cinchonism and even death (usually by pulmonary edema) in some cases. Quinine can make someone paralysed if it is injected into a nerve. It is very toxic in overdose.
Current uses.
Quinine has a bitter taste. It was first added to drinks like Bitter Lemon and Tonic Water. Both of these drinks originally came from Africa. There, Quinine was added to have some protection against Malaria. In China, it is sometimes added to drugs against the Common cold. Quinine is also often used to add a bitter taste to food. Usually this has to be declared though. Quinine can also stimulate the muscles of the uterus. For this reason, pregnant women should not take too much of it.
