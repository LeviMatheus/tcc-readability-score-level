Pesto is a kind of sauce that originated in Liguria, in Italy. The uncooked sauce is made of basil which is crushed. Other ingredients are garlic, salt, pine nuts and certain kinds of cheese (most often Parmesan cheese, Pecorino Sardo or Pecorino Romano).
Pesto is often used as a sauce for pasta.
There is a similar dish in the Provence, in France. It contains no nuts or cheese. It is called Pistou.
