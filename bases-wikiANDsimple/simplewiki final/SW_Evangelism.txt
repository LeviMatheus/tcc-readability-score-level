Evangelism is the Christian practice of preaching the truth of Jesus Christ to both Christians and non-Christians. The purpose of most "evangelism" is to help others receive eternal (forever) Salvation to people who have not heard of, or have denied God. "Evangelism" is done in obedience to the Great Commission, a command from Jesus to his disciples to convert others, as recorded in the New Testament. Christians who are good at "evangelism" are known as evangelists, whether in their areas or to far away places. Some Christian traditions consider "evangelists" to be in a leadership position, and they may be found preaching to large meetings.
