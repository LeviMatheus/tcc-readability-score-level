The Gospel of Matthew is a book of the Bible. It is one of the four gospels of the New Testament that tell the story of the life and teachings of Jesus. "Matthew's Gospel" is placed first in order, before the gospels of Mark, Luke and John. However, it is not believed to be the first one that was written. It is believed that it was written by the Apostle Matthew, who was also called Levi. Matthew was one of the Twelve apostles of Jesus.
Matthew wrote the Gospel mainly for the Jewish people, to show them that Jesus is really the Messiah. Matthew's gospel is similar to both Mark's gospel and Luke's gospel, and contains many stories about Jesus' life which are very alike. Matthew's gospel has many references to Jewish scripture.
