Eleanor of Aquitaine (c. 1122 â€“ March 31, 1204) was the daughter of William X of Aquitaine. She had a younger sister called Petronilla of Aquitaine. She brought the province of Aquitaine to England when she married Henry II of England. It stayed under English control for 300 years.
The marriage was later annulled.
Eleanor was also greatly known for her work in the Second Crusade, for she inspired many people to join. So many extra people decided to join that St. Bernard ran out of crosses to give out, therfore he had to start to rip off chunks of his robe.
