Death was one of the first ever death metal bands in North America. They started in 1983 under the name Mantas and then the name was changed to Death in 1984.
Death is no longer a band because their guitarist Chuck Schuldiner died on December 13, 2001. He was 34 years old. He had brain cancer and the drugs he used to beat the cancer made him weak. He died of pneumonia. He had another band project called Control Denied during the 3 years before he died.
