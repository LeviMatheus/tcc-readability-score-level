Digestion is the way that an organism changes a substance into nutrients. This happens in the gastrointestinal system. Humans start digesting food in the mouth. Food is chewed by the teeth. Food is swallowed, which means it goes through the oesophagus. It goes into the stomach, where it is mixed with acid.
Food slowly enters the small intestine from the stomach. This is where nutrients are taken into the blood. It then enters the large intestine. water is taken away from it. The food that is left is called feces. The feces are stored in the rectum until it can leave the body through the anus.
