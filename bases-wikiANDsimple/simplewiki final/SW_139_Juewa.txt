139 Juewa is a very big and dark Main belt asteroid. It is probably made of carbonate. It was the first asteroid found from China, in Beijing. It was found by the visiting American astronomer James Craig Watson on October 10, 1874; Watson was in China to see the transit of Venus. Watson asked his hosts to name the asteroid, and they called it 瑞華, which in modern pinyin would be represented in letters as "ruìhuá", but was written Juewa according to the spelling conventions of the time. The full name was 瑞華星, which means "Star of China’s Fortune". There are three reported stellar occultations by Juewa.
