A backpack (also called rucksack, knapsack, packsack, pack, Haversack, or Bergen) is a cloth sack put on somebody's back. It usually has two straps that go over the shoulders. It is used to carry things in it, and it often has many compartments for you to put things in. People often use backpacks on camping trips, hikes, or any form of outdoor activity where people need to carry many things. It can be also used in school, or in this case, it also called a school bag.
