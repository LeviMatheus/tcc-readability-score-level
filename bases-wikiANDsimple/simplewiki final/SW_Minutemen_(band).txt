The Minutemen were a very well known American Hardcore punk band from the 1980s. The people in the band were D. Boon on guitar, Mike Watt on bass guitar and George Hurley on drums.
The Minutemen were formed in January of 1980 and began to record music that same year. They gave to the public their first EP, called "Paranoid Time", that year. Over the next five years, the Minutemen went on many music playing trips and made many albums. Some of their most well kown albums are "What Makes a Man Start Fires?" and "Double Nickels on the Dime".
The band was forced to split in 1985 due to the death of D. Boon. Boon was killed in a car crash when his girlfriend fell asleep at the wheel. After Boon's death, Watt and Hurley formed the band fIREHOSE with Minutemen fan Ed Crawford. fIREHOSE played until 1994 when they broke up. Since the breakup of fIREHOSE, Mike Watt has played in several bands and also his own solo career.
