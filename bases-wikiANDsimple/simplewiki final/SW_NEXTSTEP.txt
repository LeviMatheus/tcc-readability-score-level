NEXTSTEP was a computer operating system made by a company called NeXT. NeXT was run by Steve Jobs, who is now the CEO of Apple. NEXTSTEP was based on UNIX. It had a graphical user interface and it let people write computer programs using object-oriented programming. NEXTSTEP ran only on computers made by NeXT. Later on, NEXTSTEP was changed so that it could run on other computers. This new operating system was called OPENSTEP. In 1997, Apple bought the NeXT company and used NEXTSTEP to make Mac OS X.
