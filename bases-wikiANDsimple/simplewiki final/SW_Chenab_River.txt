The Chenab River (Punjabi: ਚਨਾਬ, IAST: canāb, Urdu: چناب, literally: 'Moon(Chan) چن River(aab)') آب is formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi located in the upper Himalayas in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, Republic of India. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Chandrabhaga. It is a tributary of the Indus River.
It flows through the Jammu region of Indian Occupied Kashmir into the plains of the Punjab, forming the boundary between the Rechna and Jech interfluves (Doabs in Persian). It is joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu تریمو and then by the Ravi River Ahmadpur Siyaal احمدپورسیال. It then merges with the Sutlej River near Uch Sharif to form the Panjnad or the 'Five Rivers', the fifth being the Beas River which joins the Satluj near Ferozepur, India. The Chenab then joins the Indus at Mithankot. The total length of the Chenab is approximately 960 kilometres.
The waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.
The Baglihar hydropower dam is being built (as of 2006) on the Chenab River in the Doda district. This is about 110 kilometers eastward of the Pakistan border in the Jammu division of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The dam is one of 9 hydro-electric projects on the Chenab River.
