Different levels of men's soccer.
A "league" is a group of teams that play against each other. There are three professional leagues of soccer teams in the Professional Division of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF or U.S. Soccer). (A "professional" team has players who get payment for playing; an "amateur" team has players who do not get paid.) The top level league is Major League Soccer (MLS). The United Soccer Leagues make up the lower divisions; the USL First Division is a 2nd division league and the USL Second Division is a 3rd division league. Under these three leagues is the 4th division league, the USL Premier Development League.
Structure of women's soccer.
The professional division of U.S. Soccer first had a 1st division women's league in 2001. However, because of debts, it ended on September 15, 2003 after 3 years. The 2nd division league is the W-League, part of the United Soccer Leagues.
Professional indoor soccer.
"Indoor soccer" is a form of soccer played inside a building, sometimes called an "arena", instead of in a stadium on a grass field. There is one national league playing indoor soccer in North America, the Major Indoor Soccer League. The MISL is part of the USSF. It is also the only league in the United States to have a Mexican team.
