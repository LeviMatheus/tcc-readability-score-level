Blu-ray is a high-density optical disc format similar to DVD. Blu-ray is the type of disc used for Playstation 3 games and for playing high-definition movies, formerly competing against the now obsolete HD DVD format. One dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store up to 50GB (gigabytes) of data. That is five times more than a DVD, and 70 times more than a CD or VCD.
Jointly developed by the Blu-ray Disc Association (BDA), a group of the world's leading consumer electronics, personal computer and media manufacturers (including Apple, Dell, Hitachi, HP, JVC, LG, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, Pioneer, Philips, Samsung, Sharp, Sony, TDK and Thomson). The format was developed to enable recording, rewriting and playback of high-definition video (HD), as well as storing large amounts of data.
While current optical disc technologies such as DVD, DVD±R, DVD±RW, and DVD-RAM rely on a red laser to read and write data, the new format uses a blue-violet laser instead, hence the name Blu-ray.
