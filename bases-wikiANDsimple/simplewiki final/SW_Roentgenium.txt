Roentgenium (,) is a chemical element. It is a transition metal. Its symbol is Rg, and its position in the periodic table of the elements is 111. It is named in honor of Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen, a German physicist. Very little is known about it.
So far, it has not been found in nature. There seem to be 4 isotopes. All of them are radioactive. They have a half life of between 3.8 milliseconds and 3.6 seconds. Because of the Inert pair effect, it could have a color similar to that of gold.
