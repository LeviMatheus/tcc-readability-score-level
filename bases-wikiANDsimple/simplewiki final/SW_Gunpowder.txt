Gunpowder (or gun powder) is a mix of chemical substances (charcoal, sulfur and saltpeter). It burns very rapidly, and creates gases. Those gases can the propel a bullet (in a gun or rifle). The burning is too slow to destroy the gun or rifle barrel (the long metallic tube).
Gunpowder was probably invented by the Chinese, the first references of black powder, which is a form of gun powder date to the 13th century, when Roger Bacon described the formula of black powder.
