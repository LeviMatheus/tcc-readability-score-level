The decimal (base ten or occasionally denary) numeral system has ten as its base. It is the most widely used numeral system, perhaps because humans have four fingers and a thumb on each hand, giving a total of ten digits over both hands.
Decimal notation.
Decimal notation is the writing of numbers in the base-ten numeral system, which uses various symbols (called digits) for no more than ten distinct values (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) to represent any numbers, no matter how large. These digits are often used with a decimal separator which indicates the start of a fractional part, and with one of the sign symbols + (positive) or âˆ’ (negative) in front of the numerals to indicate sign.
There are only two truly positional decimal systems in ancient civilization, the Chinese counting rods system and Hindu-Arabic numeric system, both required no more
than ten symbols. Other numeric systems require more symbols.
Other rational numbers.
Any rational number which cannot be expressed as a decimal fraction has a unique infinite decimal expansion ending with recurring decimals.
History.
There follows a chronological list of recorded decimal writers.
Natural languages.
A straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as "ten-one" and 23 as "two-ten-three", is found in Chinese languages except Wu, and in Vietnamese with a few irregularities. Japanese, Korean, and Thai have imported the Chinese decimal system. Many other languages with a decimal system have special words for teens and decades.
Incan languages such as Quechua and Aymara have an almost straightforward decimal system, in which 11 is expressed as "ten with one" and 23 as "two-ten with three".
Some psychologists suggest irregularities of numerals in a language may hinder children's counting ability.
