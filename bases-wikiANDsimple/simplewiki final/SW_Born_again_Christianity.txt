In Christianity, the words born again, regenerated or transformed are synonymous with spiritual rebirth and sometimes salvation. It means having a "personal" faith in Jesus Christ. The term is most often used by Evangelical, Fundamentalist, Pentecostal and some Mainline branches of Protestant Christianity.
