Bagpipes are used for making music. The are sometimes just called "pipes". They have a bag which holds air that the player keeps full by blowing into it with a tube. To make music, the bag is pressed and the air comes out through a kind of flute or "chanter". There are usually one or more other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is squeezed, called "drones". Each drone normally plays a different note. The sounds are made by a single or, more commonly, double reed which vibrates when air is blown over it.
Most people think of Scotland when they hear bagpipes, and much music from that place is written for bagpipes. Many, many other places, however, also have bagpipes: over all of Europe, some of North Africa, and into the Middle East.
Bagpipes have been played for a long time, at least a thousand years, and some think they have existed much longer than that.
