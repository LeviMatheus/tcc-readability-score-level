The eight points of the star stand for the branches[?] of the Turkic peoples. The blue band is the colour of the Turks. the green is for Islam and red is for progress and Europeanisation. The official colours and size were adopted on February 5, 1991. The flag is used on land as the civil, state and war flag, and at sea as the civil, state and naval ensign and naval jack. The specific shades of the national flag were laid out in a 2004 law.
