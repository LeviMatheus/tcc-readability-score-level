Xenon is a non-metal chemical element. It has the chemical symbol Xe and atomic number 54.
This element was discovered by Sir. William Ramsay and M.W. Travers in 1898. The element's name came from the Greek word "xenon", which means 'stranger'.
Xenon is a noble gas. Noble gases are very unreactive. However, chemists have found that xenon can react with fluorine under special conditions since 1962.
Xenon gas is used in electron tubes, bactericidal lamps, stobe lamps, and lamps used to excite ruby lasers.
