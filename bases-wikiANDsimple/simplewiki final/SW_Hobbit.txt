Hobbits are a fictional race in the Middle-earth world invented by J. R. R. Tolkien, also often called "halflings".
They appeared in the books "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings". Several important main characters in those books are hobbits, such as Bilbo Baggins and Frodo Baggins.
Hobbits (or similar beings) have become very popular and are now often used in fantasy fiction and (video) games.
Appearance.
Hobbits are like small humans between two and four foot tall. They have hair/fur on the top side of their feet, leathery foot-soles, and slightly pointed ears. They tend to be stout and often have brown and curly hair. Male hobbits do not have beards. Hobbits live longer compared to humans, and many hobbits reach the age of 100.
Culture.
Hobbits are a peaceful people and live a simple, pre-industrial life in the land which they call The Shire, and also in Breeland.
A typical hobbit-house has a long hallway with rooms on both sides, and round doors and windows. Originally these were underground in hills, then the house was called a "smial"; but this architecture(style of building) is also used for 'normal' houses above ground.
