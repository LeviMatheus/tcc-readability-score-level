The hymen (also called maidenhead) is a membrane-like tissue that blocks the vaginal opening. The hymen has no known use. Since the hymen usually breaks after having sexual intercourse, women with unbroken hymens were considered virgins. However, a woman's hymen can break while engaging in some sports as well. Some women are also born without a hymen.
Types.
There are several different types of hymen. In about 1 in 2,000 females, the hymen doesn't develop at all: this is called an "imperforate hymen".
What might damage the hymen.
The hymen may be damaged by playing sports or using tampons.
When a girl reaches puberty, the hymen becomes stretchy. Sexual intercourse is another easy way to damage the hymen along with horseback riding and biking. The hymen usually breaks after having sexual intercourse, so in some cultures, women with hymens were virgins. The hymen was also used as a way of checking whether or not a wife had not had sexual intercourse with other men. However, a woman's hymen can break while playing some sports and some women are also born without a hymen.
Hymens in other animals.
There are many more animals which have hymens, but not all are listed here.
The stages of growth.
When a fetus is developing, there is no vaginal opening. The skin covering the vagina forms the hymen., and thus, the hymen is a remnant of that structure.
In young babies, the hymen is thick and pink. This is because the mother is giving the baby hormones through breast feeding which keeps it thick. In adolescent girls, the hymen becomes thin, smooth and delicate because she has stopped taking in hormones. The hymen becomes very sensitive and can easily cause pain if touched. From puberty, the hymen gets thicker again and becomes pale pink. This is because of the hormone estrogen.
