A rope is made out of several threads. The material can be organic, like flax, or it can be small threads of steel (in case of a steel rope, wire or cable). The rope can then be used to lift things with it, or to pull things like pulling a ship into a harbour with another ship, or fixing the ship so it does not drift away.
