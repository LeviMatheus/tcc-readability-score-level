"Homer Sweet Homer" is an episode of the Ducktales series.
Episode.
One day, at Manor McDuck, Scrooge is reading a book when Huey, Dewey and Louie come in with a letter from Donald Duck. There are photos with the letter, and one of the photos shows the feet of a statue. Scrooge looks in a history book and finds a picture of Itaquack's Colossus. Scrooge tells the kids that they are going to the Mediterranean.
Meanwhile, in 1000 AD, in Itaquack, Circe tries to destroy the prince Homer with a spell but fails, and instead transports Scrooge and the kids to the past. Our heroes fight mermaids, monsters and an evil king until they finally come to Itaquack. At the royal palace, Scrooge and the nephews take over, destroy Circe's medallion and go back to the future.
In the future, Scrooge and the nephews appear on a shipwreck, where they are rescued by the Navy. On the ship, the kids say they want to be as brave as Uncle Scrooge, but Scrooge says that people often become what they really are. Donald says, ironically, that the kids will be like him (something that Scrooge and the Navy captain do not want!).
