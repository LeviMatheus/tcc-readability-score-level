The South China Sea is a marginal sea south of China. It is a part of the Pacific Ocean, occupying an area from Singapore to the Strait of Taiwan of around 3,500,000 kmÂ². It is one of the largest sea bodies after the five oceans. There are hundreds of minute South China Sea Islands, collectively an archipelago. The sea and its mostly uninhabited islands are subject to several competing claims of sovereignty by neighboring nations. These competing claims are also reflected in the variety of names used for the islands and the sea.
