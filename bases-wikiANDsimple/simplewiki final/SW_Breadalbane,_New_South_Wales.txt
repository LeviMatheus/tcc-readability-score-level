Breadalbane () is a small village on the Lachlan River in New South Wales, Australia. It is near Goulburn in the Upper Lachlan Shire. This little town is also on the Hume Highway which links Sydney and Melbourne. The highway used to go through the small town but it was bypassed in the early 1990s. Breadalbane is also situated on the Sydney-Melbourne railway line.
Breadalbane is also near the start of the Federal Highway. This branches off the Hume Highway just south of Goulburn and goes to Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory. Canberra is the capital city of Australia where the Commonwealth Federal Parliament sits.
History.
Breadalbane is a very historic town. There are now only a few houses. In the past there was a hotel, service station and a railway station. These are now closed, although the old hotel and service station buildings are still there. They are now used as private houses. The railway station opened in 1875 and closed in 1974. The signal box was still used until 1979. All trace of the station has been removed, although a loading bank is still standing.
