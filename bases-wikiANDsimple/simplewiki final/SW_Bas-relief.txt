Bas-relief is a sort of sculpture where the sulpture has less depth behind the faces or figures than the actual faces or figures would have, when measured.
The advantage of the natural contour of the figures allows the work to be viewed from many angles without distortion of the figures themselves. There is a continuum of the bas relief technique into the next category, alto-relievo, or high relief. This technique combines the rounded figures with significantly deeper backgrounds. Instead of the backgrounds being a few inches deep, they may be a foot to several feet deep.
