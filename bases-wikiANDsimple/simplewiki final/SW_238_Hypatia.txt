238 Hypatia is a very big Main belt asteroid. It is classified as a C-type asteroid and is probably made of primitive carbonaceous material. Like many asteroids of this type, its surface is very dark in colour.
It was found by Viktor Knorre on July 1, 1884 in Berlin. It was the third asteroid he found.
The name was given in honour of philosopher Hypatia of Alexandria.
