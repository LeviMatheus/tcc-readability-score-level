In physics, centrifugal force (from Latin centrum "center" and fugere "to flee") is a fictitious force that appears when describing physics in a rotating reference frame; it acts on anything with mass considered in such a frame.
If a friend is watched in a car that turns a sharp corner to the left, then it can be seen that they must be accelerated to the left - otherwise the car would go left and they would carry straight on and then fall out. So there must be a Newtonian force applied by the car on your friend. This real force is called a centripetal force - "aiming towards the center" - and acts towards the centre of the circle of rotation.
But if another friend had sat in a car that turns a sharp corner to the left, it would have felt as if he was thrown across to the right - by some imaginary force that is acting on him. This fictitious force is called a centrifugal force - "running away from the centre"
This is a problem that appears in rotating situations. There is a difference between what appears to be happening if watched from the outside or if the event was seen from within a rotating object. These differing viewpoints are called frames of reference.
Despite the name, fictitious forces are experienced as very real by anyone whose immediate environment is a non-inertial frame. Even for observers in an inertial frame, fictitious forces provide a natural way to discuss dynamics within rotating environments such as planets, centrifuges, carousels, turning cars, and spinning buckets.
