Myocardium is the muscular tissue of the heart. Other tissues are the endocardium (inner lining, effectively a specialised endothelium) and the pericardium (a connective tissue layer around the heart).
It is the middle layer of the walls of the heart, made of cardiac muscle, that contracts to push out blood.
