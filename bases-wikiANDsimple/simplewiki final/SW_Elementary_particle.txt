In particle physics, an elementary particle is a particle "not" made up of smaller particles. All elementary particles are either bosons or fermions.
For example: Atoms are "not" elementary particles because they are made of protons and neutrons joined together. Protons and neutrons are "not" elementary particles because they are made up of quarks joined together. Quarks "are" elementary because there is nothing else that makes up quarks.
This is part of the Standard Model which is the best way that physics has to explain the particles.
