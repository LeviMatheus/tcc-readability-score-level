A hovercraft is a vehicle that is supported and moved by a cushion of air blowing downwards. They are used on water and land where the surface is smooth. They are often used as ferries and by militaries for amphibious, or on water and on land (like an amphibian can live in water and land) missions. A hovercraft can move cargo, people, and cars.
