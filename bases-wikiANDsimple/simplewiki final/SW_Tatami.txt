mats are a traditional Japanese flooring. The top surface is made of woven straw. Traditional tatami are packed with straw. Nowadays some of them are packed with styrofoam. Tatami are individual mats. They have a uniform size and shape. They have borders of brocade or plain green cloth.
Tatami were originally a luxury item for the wealthy at a time when lower classes had mat-covered dirt floors. Tatami were gradually popularized. They finally reached the homes of commoners towards the end of the 17th century.
The origin of Tatami is described in Kojiki (Records of Ancient Matters).
At the end of the 8th century (beginning of the Heian period), Tatami’s size was standardized and it became thicker, so it became similar to today’s Tatami.
By the 12th century (still the Heian period), people used Tatami as cushions on the wooden floor.
In the 12th century (the Kamakura period), the usage was fixed that Tatami were spread all over the floor of a room, as people use them today.
In the 17th century (the Edo period), Tatami became an important part of building.
In these days, some people use Tatami as cushions on the floor again, like the usage in the Heian period, because style of living in Japan is changing to Western-style.
