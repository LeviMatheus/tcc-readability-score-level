Rhythmic gymnastics is sub-sport to artistic gymnastics, a cross between ballet and artistic gymnastics. It requires catching things in between leaps, and sometimes people must make it fall between their legs or on their back. Gymnasts utilize things such as ribbons, balls, hoops, clubs and ropes. The gymnast must be more flexible than a artistic gymnast. It became an Olympic sport in 1984, and it came about in Northern Europe in the 19th century. There are training centers across the world.
