Uckermark is a "Kreis" (district) in the northeastern part of Brandenburg, Germany. The district has the biggest area of any district in Germany.
The current district Uckermark was made in 1993 by joining the old districts of AngermÃ¼nde, Prenzlau and Templin, as well as the previously district-free city of Schwedt.
