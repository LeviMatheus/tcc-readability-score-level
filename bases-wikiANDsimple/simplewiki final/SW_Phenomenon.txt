A phenomenon (Greek: ", pl. ") is an observable event or, quite literally, something that can be seen.
It comes from the noun ("phainomenon, df. appearance") and is also related to the verb ("phainein, df. to show"). Its plural is phenomena. Its antonym is "lathomenon", meaning "something lying beneath the surface".
General sense and use.
In general, apart from its original use as a term in philosophy, "phenomenon" stands for any observable event. Some events are easy to observe, others need scientific experiments that make observation possible.
Phenomenon can also mean a "surprising development" or "unusually successful person".
