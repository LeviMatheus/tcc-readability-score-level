The Sand Cat ("Felis margarita") is a small wild cat of the Felinae subfamily. It is distributed over African and Asian deserts.
The name "desert cat" is reserved for a subspecies of the true wildcat, but it would be appropriate for this species. It lives in those arid areas that are too hot and dry even for the desert cat: the Sahara, the Arabian Desert, and the deserts of Iran and Pakistan. It lives for about 13 years in captivity.
