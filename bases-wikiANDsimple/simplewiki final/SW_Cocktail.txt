A Cocktail is a kind of mixed drink. Usually, it is made with alcoholic drinks such as vodka, gin or rum. Since such spirits do not have much taste of their own (at around 40% alcohol), other ingredients are added. Common ingredients are fruits, fruit juice, sugar, crushed ice, and ice cubes. If the cocktail is served in a bar or nightclub, it is often garnished with a piece of fruit, for example: a Gin and Tonic could be garnished with lemon, a Pina Colada with pineapple and a cherry.
Cocktails that do not contain any alcohol also exist.
Because all the ingredients give their flavour to the finished drink, a cocktail is only as good as its worst ingredient.
