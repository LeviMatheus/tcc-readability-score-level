The term template, when used in the context of word processing software, refers to a sample "fill-in-the-blank" document that can be completed either by hand or through an automated iterative process, such as a with a wizard. Once the template is completed, the user can edit, save and manage the result as an ordinary word processing document. Word processing templates give the ability to bypass the original setup and configuration time necessary to create standardized documents such as a resume. They also give the automatic configuration of the User Interface of the Word processing software, with features such as autocompletion, toolbars, thesaurus, and spelling options.
