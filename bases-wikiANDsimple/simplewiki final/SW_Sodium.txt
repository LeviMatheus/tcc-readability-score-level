Sodium (symbol Na, from the Latin name "natrium") is the chemical element number 11 in the periodic table of elements. It follows that its nucleus includes 11 protons, and 11 electrons orbit around it (according to the simplified model known as "Niels Bohr atom"). Even if a relatively large number of isotopes can be artificially produced, all decay in a short time. As a consequence all sodium found in nature (mainly in sea water) has the composition 11Na23, meaning that the nucleus includes 12 neutrons. The atomic mass of sodium is 22.9898,rounded it would be 23
Sodium is a light, white metal. Sodium is so soft that it can be easily cut with a knife.
Sodium reacts violently with water, producing hydrogen gas and sodium hydroxide. It has one valence electron. sodium was discovered by Sir Humphrey davis, an english scientist, back in 1807. it reacts in water by bursting into flames.
