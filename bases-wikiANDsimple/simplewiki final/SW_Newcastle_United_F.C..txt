History.
Newcastle United was formed in 1892 after the two rival clubs Newcastle West End and Newcastle East End grouped together. They have played their matches at the ground St.James' Park ever since. This ground holds 52,000 people, and is one of the biggest in England. It is located just outside the centre of Newcastle.
Newcastle originally played in red and white stripes. They changed to the familiar black and white stripes in 1904 so that they would not be confused with Sunderland - Sunderland and Middlesbrough are Newcastle's local rivals.
The club has suffered from little success since the mid-fifties. The last trophy they won was the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006.
