The P-39 Airacobra was a fighter aircraft made by Bell Aircraft. It first flew in 1939, and was introduced in 1941. It was known for being very unstable and could lose control easily. It also was not good above 15,000 feet. But the Soviet Union used it during World War II in a good way. They did not use it to attack German tanks.
The P-39 was different from a lot of aircraft in World War II. It had "tricycle" landing gear (like a tricycle), doors that opened like a car (pilots would climb out of most fighters of the time). The "Q" version could go 375 miles per hour, had 4 13mm cannons, and one 37mm cannon.
