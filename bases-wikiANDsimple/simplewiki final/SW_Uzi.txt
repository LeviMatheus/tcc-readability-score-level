There are many different kinds of Uzis: Mini Uzi, which is a smaller version of the Uzi, Micro Uzi; which is only slightly larger than a standard pistol, Para Micro Uzi; which was made for counter terrorist units, and the Uzi Pistol; which is the semi-automatic (meaning it fires 1 bullet every time you pull the trigger). All of these kinds of Uzis are still in use by the special forces today. It is being replaced by the MP-5 slowly.
