Neutrons Make up an atom along with Protons And Electrons. The Neutron is found In the Nucleus of an atom, along with the Proton. Unlike the proton, which has a positive charge, or electron, which has a negative charge, the neutron has no charge.
Neutrons of the British scientist was found by James Chadwick. And before that, by Rutherford that his presence was mentioned. Rutherford has a number of atomic nuclei of them had the mass, the mass of the atom and protons that make up the mass of the atom does not know this was a match. And the mass of protons about half the mass of the atom that you got it. So the mass of protons in the nucleus and do not let your king has a similar mass particles such as protons and the number was thought to exist. Since then, the UK's Chadwick in 1932, learned of the existence of neutrons. The Beryllium has been made of a thin pane conflict α line. And he does not find them charge a bolt came out particles, the particles called neutrons was.
Neutrons that the mass 1.675 × 10-24g a little heavier than the proton. Neutrons and protons in the electronic mass of more than 1800 times heavy, and the mass of protons and neutrons that big because the difference between the mass of a proton's mass, the neutrons 1, the mass of electrons in the 1 / 1800 to think about. Because of the mass of electrons, atoms are small enough to ignore the mass of the neutrons and protons in the atomic mass of the sum will be.
The number of protons in the nucleus contains a neutron number of matches is a lot of cases.
