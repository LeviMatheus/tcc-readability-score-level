Second Life is a big online game. Unlike most games, Second
Life does not have any single thing that players must do. They are free to do anything they want. They are also free to make up new things and add them to Second Life. Players can make places, clothes, and other things. Because of this, some people think that Second Life is not a game at all. They say that it is a platform (in computing, "a platform" can mean something which is used as a base from which you make things).
All players are free to do anything they want in Second Life. Because of this, in fact there are some things that cannot be done in Second Life that can be in other online games, because other people will not let them be done when they have a free choice.

Because Second Life lets people make things, people can make things that are about real life things. Many universities and companies are using Second Life for education and training, including Harvard and Oxford universities.
