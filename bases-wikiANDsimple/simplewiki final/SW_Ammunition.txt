Ammunition, often called ammo, comes from the French word "la munition". At first it meant all items used for war. This was from the Latin word "munire" (to provide). It now is used only for gunpowder and artillery. The group word for all types of ammunition is munitions. This means anything that can be used in combat and includes bombs, missiles, warheads, and mines (landmines, naval mines, and claymore mines). These are made in munitions factories.
Ammunition is mainly used to send out force against a target. Ammunition can also include flares and incendaries - chemicals that start fires. Since the making of the cartridge, ammunition has come to mean the putting of a projectile - the item that is sent to hit the target, and its propellant - the chemical that creates the force, into a single package.
Ammmunition is a complex subject. It covers use of fire to a hit target, use of weapons by people, explosives and propellants, cartridges, high explosive projectiles (HE), warheads, special shells to attack armour and aircraft, carrier projectiles, fuses, mortar ammunition, small arms (revolver and pistol) ammunition, grenades, mines, flares, improved conventional munitions, and computer guided munition.
