Vodka is an alcoholic drink that is usually about 40% alcohol. It is clear, and is usually mixed with other liquids before people drink it.
Things that are made into Vodka.
Unlike cognac or whisky, vodka is not usually matured in barrels, but bottled immediately. Some Scandinavian vodkas called akvavit (Latin aqua vitae, "water of life") are matured in oak barrels before they are bottled. When the vodka is bottled, it is ready for drinking.
History.
Most people think the name Vodka comes from the Slavic word for water It is diminutive form, "little water". The earliest mention of Vodka in Poland is in 1405. The Russians are known to have first used the word in June 8, 1751. It is not known if it was the Russians or the Poles who made the first drinks that could be classified as vodka.
Different kinds of Vodka.
There are two basic kinds of Vodka: Clear vodka and flavoured vodka. Some types of vodka have plants or herbs added to the unflavored vodka to make it taste better.
How Vodka is consumed.
Vodka is either drunk pure, or cocktails are made with it. The simplest form of cocktail is to mix it with orange or lemon juice. Usually, vodka is drunk during a longer meal. Usually salty or sour things (not sweets) are served. In Russia and Poland, Vodka is drunk from glasses that can hold about 100 grams (0,1 litres) of vodka. Very often, it is consumed with a slice of lemon (much like Tequila). The glass is usually emptied in one draught, while holding the breath. Directly after wards something small is eaten. Before drinking, a toast is given.
There is a joke on how people drink vodka in different countries.
