Kidney failure (also called renal failure) is a term used to describe when a person's kidneys stop working properly. Renal failure can be divided into two categories: chronic renal failure, and acute renal failure.
It is possible to have acute renal failure on top of chronic renal failure. This is called acute-on-chronic renal failure.
