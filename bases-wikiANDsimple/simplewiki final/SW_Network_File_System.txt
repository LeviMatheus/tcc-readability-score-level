A Network file system is a file system that allows the sharing of computer files over a network. The first file servers were developed in the 1970s. In 1985, Sun Microsystems created the file system called "Network File System" (NFS) which became the first widely used network file system. Other notable network file systems are Andrew File System (AFS), NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), and Server Message Block (SMB) which is also known as Common Internet File System (CIFS).
