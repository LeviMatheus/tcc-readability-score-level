A vehicle is a form of transport to move persons from one place to another. It is not alive; a horse can bring a person from place to place, but it is not a vehicle. A vehicle carries things too.
Most vehicles have wheels, but not all do. Ships and airplanes are vehicles, but they do not use wheels to move.
Some vehicles may be petrol or diesel driven with a steering wheel. Usually vehicles have four wheels but some three or two wheeled vehicles do exist, such as motorcycles. Some vehicles are powered by humans like bicycles. Some vehicles are pulled by animals like chariots.
