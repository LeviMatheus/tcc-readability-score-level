Smallpox is a very bad disease. It is caused by a virus. There are two different kinds of viruses that you can have. They are called "Variola major" and "Variola minor". Some people also call smallpox Variola, named after the viruses' fancy name.
Only people can get this disease. "Variola major" kills between 20% and 40% of those who get it. "Variola minor" kills only about 1%. Many people who survive become blind because of the damage the virus does to the eyes.
During the first half of the 20th century, between 300 million and 500 millon people died of this disease. Even in 1967, about 15 million people caught the disease, and about 2 millon people died of it, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The first cure for smallpox used the results of cowpox infections. A vaccine was developed and used to cure smallpox. A vaccine is the real term for that "shot" we all have to get from time to time. In 1979, the WHO said the disease no longer existed, and no one would ever get sick from it again. However, live copies of Smallpox are kept in different maximum-security laboratories around the world.
Some believe that smallpox could be used as an agent for purposely infecting enemies in a war. Today, most people no longer receive a smallpox shot; but a few very, very old people still need it.
If you have smallpox, you'd know it: your entire body would be covered in bumps that are far worse than the chicken pox.
