The Polynesian Rat, or Pacific Rat ("Rattus exulans"), known to the Māori as kiore, is the third most widespread species of rat in the world behind the Brown Rat and Black rat. The Polynesian Rat originates in Southeast Asia but, like its cousins, has become well travelled - infiltrating most Polynesian islands, New Zealand, Fiji, and even Hawaii.
