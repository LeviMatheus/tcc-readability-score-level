"Spacewar!" is one of the first known video games. It was released in 1962. In this game, the player has to shoot the other spaceships while flying around a star. The ships shoot missiles (rockets) which were unaffected (nothing happened) by the gravity. Each ship had only a few missiles and only a little bit of fuel. The hyperspace could be used to avoid from being hit by an missile but the ship would come back at a random place. And the more the player used it, the bigger the chance that the spaceship would explode.
