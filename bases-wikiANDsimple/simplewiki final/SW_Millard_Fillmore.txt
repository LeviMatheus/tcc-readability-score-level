Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 - March 8, 1874) was the 13th President of the United States. He was President from 1850 to 1853. Fillmore was the last person from the Whig Party to be president.
Fillmore became president in 1850 when the 12th president (Zachary Taylor) died. The Whig party did not pick him to run for president in 1852. He ran for president in 1856 for the Know Nothing Party, but lost.
Before he was president.
Millard Fillmore grew up in a poor family. He worked hard to do well in school, and went to college. He got a job as a lawyer in 1823. In 1828 he was voted to be part of the New York congress, and made friends in the Whig Party. This helped him get chosen to run for vice president in 1848.
Being president.
When he was vice president, Millard Fillmore was in charge of the United States Senate while it was fighting over a decision about slavery involving Texas and New Mexico. As president, Fillmore signed the Compromise of 1850. This made some of the people in his Whig Party upset at him, and they stopped him from running for president in 1852.
He also started the first library at the White House. There is a joke that Fillmore put the first bathtub in the White House, but this is not true.
After being president.
After Fillmore, Franklin Pierce became the 14th president. Fillmore got a job in charge of the University of Buffalo. Fillmore joined the Know Nothing Party and tried to run for president again, but the Know Nothing Party was not very successful.
There is a statue of Millard Fillmore at City Hall in Buffalo, New York.
