This is a list of the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. Roman Mythology uses different names, calling Zeus by the name of Jupiter, and Aphrodite by the name of Venus, for example. The Roman names are often better known to English-speaking people than the Greek names.
It was thought that each god ruled a certain part of the environment and human life. The primordial gods mostly controlled the natural environment. The twelve Olympian gods, as well as controlling nature, ruled over many aspects of human life, including love, marriage, war etc. In the stories of Greek mythology, the gods often argued among themselves, and played favorites with human beings. They would make things go well for a human, (particularly a hero), that they liked, but could make things go very badly for another god's favorite. They sometimes had love affairs with human beings, and when children were born, they often had special powers. The most famous of all "demi-gods" was Heracles (or Hercules) who was the son of Zeus and a human woman.
