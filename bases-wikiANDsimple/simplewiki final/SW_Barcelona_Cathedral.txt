The Cathedral of Santa Eulalia (also called "La Seu") the Gothic cathedral seat of the Archbishop of Barcelona, Spain. The famous Sagrada Família currently being built is not a cathedral. The cathedral was constructed from the 13th to the 15th century. There was a Visigothic church there before. The Gothic-like façade is from the 19th century.
The cathedral is dedicated to Eulalia of Barcelona, co-patron saint of Barcelona. According to Catholic tradition, Eulalia was a young virgin who suffered martyrdom during Roman times in Barcelona. The body of Saint Eulalia is entombed in the cathedral's crypt.
One side chapel is dedicated to "Christ of Lepanto", and contains a cross from a ship that fought at the Battle of Lepanto (1571). The body of the cross is shifted to the right. Catalan legend says that the body swerved to avoid getting hit by a cannonball. This is believed to have been a sign from God that the Ottomans would be defeated.
The cathedral has a secluded Gothic cloister where thirteen white geese are kept (it is said that Eulalia was 13 when she was murdered).
