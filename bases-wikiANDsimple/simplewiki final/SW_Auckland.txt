Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand. The Auckland region has a population of about 1.4 million people. For a brief period in New Zealand's history it was the capital city; however that was moved to Wellington.
Auckland is situated on two magnificent harbours. It is known as the "City of Sails" and the nearby Hauraki Gulf is dotted with a variety of islands and provides safe anchorage and interesting sailing.
Auckland is built on a series of dormant volcanos. The youngest and largest of these is called Rangitoto, an island just a few kilometres from the City centre. It is lush with pohutakawas, native trees also known as the New Zealand Christmas tree because of their brilliant red flowers which bloom in December.
