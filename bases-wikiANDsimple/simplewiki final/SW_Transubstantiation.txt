Transubstantiation is the belief of Catholics and some other Christian churches that the bread and wine that is eaten and drank at Mass becomes (changes into) the body and blood of Jesus, who Christians believe is the son of God.
Beliefs about Transubstantiation.
Christians who believe in Transubstantiation think that the bread that they eat at Mass is the body of Jesus, but they know that the bread still tastes like bread, looks like bread and smells like bread. It is just like bread, but it is the body of Jesus. This started when Jesus ate a meal called "the Last Supper" and he said that the bread his friends were eating was his body. In the bible it says "Take this all of you and eat it, this is my body which will be given up for you," and, "Take this all of you and drink from it, this is the cup of my blood, the blood of the new and everlasting covenant, it will be shed for you and for all for that sins may be forgiven. Do this in memory of me." From that time until now, people have continued what Jesus did and it reminds them of the Last Supper, so the bread that is eaten at Mass becomes Jesus' body.
