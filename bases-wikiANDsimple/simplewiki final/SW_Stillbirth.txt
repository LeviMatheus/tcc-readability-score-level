A stillbirth happens when a fetus (unborn baby) dies while still inside the mother or dies during delivery (childbirth). It is said that the delivered baby is "stillborn". Stillbirth is different from a miscarriage because a stillbirth happens after the baby has been living inside its mother 20 to 24 weeks (depending on the country). It is called a miscarriage if the baby lived inside the mother for less time.
Occurrence.
The number of stillbirths in the United States is about 1 in 115 births, which is about 26,000 a year, or one every 20 minutes. In developing countries, where medical care is not as advanced or good, the number of stillbirths is higher.
In Australia, England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the rate is about 1 in 200 babies..
United Kingdom.
In the UK, any baby that leaves its mother's body after 24 weeks and doesn't show any signs of life is called a "stillbirth". The parent(s) must register the baby and a Stillbirth Certificate is given to the parent(s).
Australia.
In Australia, any stillborn fetus that weighs more than 400 grams and lived in the mother for more than 20 weeks must be registered.
United States.
The United States does not have a formal definition of "stillborn" babies. All pregnancies are legally called either: "live birth", "fetal death", or "induced termination of prgnancy" (abortion). The law does not have a difference between a stillbirth and a miscarriage. However, it is recommended to register infants who weighed over 350 grams or who lived over 19 weeks inside the mother before dying.
