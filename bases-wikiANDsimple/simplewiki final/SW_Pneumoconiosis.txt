Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is a lung disease caused by the breathing-in of very small particles of sand or quartz dust found in volcanoes.
The origins of this forty-five-letter word have, however, been considered as a hoax. It was first seen in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1936.
The real name of this disease is the fourteen-letter pneumoconiosis. This is the longest word in English (other than names of places).
There is another long word and it is 30 letters it is "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism," and is a certain kind of disorder.
