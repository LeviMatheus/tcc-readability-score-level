Louis Braille (born January 4, 1809, died January 6, 1852) was a French inventor who invented the "Braille" system, which helps blind people read. Braille is read by passing one's fingers over characters made up of an arrangement of one to six embossed points. It has been adapted to almost every known language.
Louis Braille was the child of a saddle-maker. He was the youngest of four children. He became blind at the age of three. He accidentally stuck an awl into one eye. There were no antibiotics and soon his injured eye was infected. It spread to his other eye and soon, he became blind in both eyes. He went to the Royal Institute of Blind Youth at the age of ten. Braille was a good student, especially when it came to science and music. Later he became a church organist. He was also a teacher at the Institute of Blind Youth. Louis Braille died at the age of 43 due to tuberculosis.
