113 Amalthea is a fairly common rocky Main belt asteroid orbiting in the closer areas of the belt. It was found by R. Luther on March 12, 1871. One of Jupiter's closer small moons is also called Amalthea. The name comes from Amalthea of Greek mythology.
Amalthea is thought to be a piece from the mantle of a Vesta-sized parent body that broke up around one billion years ago, with the other major remnant being 9 Metis.
