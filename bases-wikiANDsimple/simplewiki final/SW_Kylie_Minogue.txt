Kylie Ann Minogue (born May 28, 1968 in Melbourne, Australia) is a singer and actress. She became popular in the late 1980s, because of her role in the Australian television soap opera "Neighbours", before being a dance-pop singer.
Signed to a contract by British songwriters and producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman, she got hit records throughout the world. Her popularity began to decline by the early 1990s and she left Stock, Aitken & Waterman in 1992. For years she tried to become an independent performer and songwriter. Her projects were widely talked about, but her albums resulted in the lowest sales of her career.
In 2000, Minogue became popular again as a dance-pop singer and became well-known for her sexual music videos and expensive concerts. She has one of the longest and most successful careers in pop music, and she has become one of the most recognisable celebrities and sex symbols. In Australia, she holds the record for the highest concert ticket sales for a woman, and has had 9 singles at number 1 on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart.
On May 17 2005, Minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was on tour at the time, and the rest of it had to be cancelled. Minogue had surgery for it on May 21 2005 at a hospital in Malvern, and started chemotherapy soon afterwards. She finished her chemotherapy treatment in January 2006, but still needed six more weeks of radiotherapy to stop any new cancerous tumours from growing.
