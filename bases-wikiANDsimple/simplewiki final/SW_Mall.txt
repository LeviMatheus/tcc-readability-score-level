A mall is a large building that contains many stores (usually over 200) that are close to each other and sell products.
Overview.
People visit the stores in the mall to shop. Most malls have parking lots (places to park cars). Most malls have roofs so people can shop inside. Most malls have a food court, which is an area where people buy food. More modern malls have Movie theatres. Malls are mainly for buying clothing, but other items may be bought.
