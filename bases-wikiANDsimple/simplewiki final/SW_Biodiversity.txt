Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variation of different life forms within a given ecosystem or for the entire Earth. Biodiversity is often a measure of thehealth of biological systems to indicate if there could be a danger that species get extinct.
Variation helps species live in a population, therefore creating Biodiversity.
