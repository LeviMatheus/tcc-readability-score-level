East is one of the 4 main directions on a compass. East is normally to the right on most maps. Japan is east of China, Saudi Arabia is east of Egypt, and Sweden is east of Norway. The countries in the Eastern Mediterranean and around the Red Sea and the Gulf of Arabia are usually called the "Middle East". China, India, Japan, and other countries in that part of the world make up the "Far East." The sun and moon rise in the east.
