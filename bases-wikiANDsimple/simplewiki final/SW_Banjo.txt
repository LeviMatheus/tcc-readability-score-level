The banjo is a string instrument, that was first played by African slaves a few hundred years ago in the United States. The idea came from other African instruments.
The name "banjo" may have come from a Kimbundu word: "mbanza", but it could have also come from a Senegambian word for the bamboo stick used for the banjo's neck.
