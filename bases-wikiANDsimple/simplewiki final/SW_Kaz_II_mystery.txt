The "Kaz II" is a 12 metre catamaran that was found drifting 160 km (80 nautical miles) off the northern coast of Australia on April 18, 2007. What happened to the crew of the boat is still unknown. The circumstances in which they disappeared are mysterious and have been compared to that of the 1800s ship Mary Celeste.
