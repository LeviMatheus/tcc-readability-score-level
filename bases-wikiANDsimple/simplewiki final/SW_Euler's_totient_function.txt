In number theory, the totient formula_1 of a positive integer "n" is defined to be the number of positive integers less than "n" which are coprime to "n".
For example, formula_3 since the four numbers 1, 3, 5 and 7 are coprime to 8.
The function formula_4 so defined is the totient function.
The totient is usually called the Euler totient or Euler's totient, after the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, who studied it.
The totient function is also called Euler's phi function or simply the phi function, since the letter Phi (formula_4) is so commonly used for it. The cototient of "n" is defined as formula_6.
The totient function is important mainly because it gives the size of the multiplicative group of integers modulo "n". More precisely, formula_1 is the order of the group of units of the ring formula_8. This fact, together with Lagrange's theorem, provides a proof for Euler's theorem.
