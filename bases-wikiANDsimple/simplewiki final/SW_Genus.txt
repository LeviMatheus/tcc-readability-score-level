In taxonomy, when scientists talk about a genus (one genus, several genera'") of animals, they mean several closely related species of those animals. Several genera make up a family.
Genus is the "great" in the mnemonic, or a saying to help a person remember something, King Phillip Came Over For Great Spaghetti. When writing a scientific name of an organism, you need to write the name with the genus in fromt. For example, "Felis silvestris catus", Felis is the genus. The genus must always be capitalised.
