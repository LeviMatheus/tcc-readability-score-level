EastLink is a tollway (meaning people have to pay to drive on it) in Melbourne, Victoria. It was opened on June 28, 2008. It links the Frankston Freeway to the Eastern Freeway, and includes two tunnels, the Mullum Mullum tunnel and the Melba tunnel.
EastLink was intitally going to be a freeway, meaning it would not be tolled. However, the Premier of Victoria at the time, Steve Bracks, decided to toll the freeway. This led to people not being happy.
The interchange with the Monash Freeway, the largest in Victoria, is known as the Tom Wills interchange. This was announced on February 27, 2008. This particluar interchange was chosen because it was within a short distance from Waverely Park, and the home of the Hawthorn Football Club.
Tolls are paid by either a bill sent in the mail, going and buying a pass from a shop or having a account (and having a electronic Breeze tag or another tollways type of electronic tag in the car).
