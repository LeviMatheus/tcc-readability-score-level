Antidifferentiation (or indefinite integration) is a part of mathematics. It is the opposite of differentiation. It is integrating with no limits. The answer is an equation.
It is written as formula_1
Simple integration.
To integrate formula_6
formula_13
formula_15
Integrating a bracket ("chain rule").
If you want to integrate a bracket like formula_21, we need to do it a different way. It is called the chain rule. It is like simple integration. It only works if the formula_3 in the bracket has a power of 1 (it is linear) like formula_3 or formula_24 (not formula_25 or formula_26).
To do formula_27
Examples.
formula_35
formula_36
