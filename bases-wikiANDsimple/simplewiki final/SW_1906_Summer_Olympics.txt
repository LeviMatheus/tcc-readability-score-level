The 1906 Summer Olympics, also called the 1906 Intercalated Games, were held in Athens, Greece. These games are not awarded the title of "Olympiad" because they were held between the III and IV Olympiads. Medals were given to the participants during these games, but the medals are not officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee.
