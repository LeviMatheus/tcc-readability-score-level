In Egyptian mythology, Geb was the god of the earth. Geb was the husband and brother of the sky goddess Nut and the father of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys and Seth. When Seth and Horus (Osiris' son) fought to become the king of Egypt, Geb made Horus the ruler of the living. Geb's parents are Tefnut and Shu.
The ancient Egyptians believed that earthquakes were Geb's laughter.
The animal of Geb is a snake. Geb is sometimes equivalent of Greek titan Kronos. Geb's name means "weak one" or "lame one". Geb is also god of the vegetation.
