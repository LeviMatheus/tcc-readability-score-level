"Speaker for the Dead" (1986) is a science fiction book that is written by Orson Scott Card. It is a sequel to the novel "Ender's Game", and takes place around the year 5135, some 3,000 years after the events in "Ender's Game". Because of space travel, the main character Ender is only about 35 years old.
Like "Ender's Game", the book won the Hugo Award (1987) and Nebula Award (1986) for outstanding science fiction novel, making Card the first writer to win both of these awards two times in a row. "Speaker for the Dead" was updated in 1991. It was followed by "Xenocide" and "Children of the Mind".
