Parmenides (also Parmenides of Elea) (Greek:, early 5th century BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Elea and was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. His only known work is a poem, but only bits and pieces have survived. In it, he describes two views of reality. These thoughts strongly influenced Plato, and later, the whole of western philosophy.
