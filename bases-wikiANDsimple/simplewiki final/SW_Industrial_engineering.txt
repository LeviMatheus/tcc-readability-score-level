Industrial and systems engineering is one of the fastest growing areas of engineering. It looks at the "big picture" of what makes organizations work bestâ€”the right combination of human and natural resources, technology and equipment, and information and finance. Industrial and systems engineering is vital to solving today's critical and complex problems in manufacturing, distribution of goods and services, health care, utilities, transportation, entertainment, and the environment. Industrial and systems engineers design and refine processes and systems to improve quality, safety and productivity.
