Avet Terterian (1929 - 1994) was a leading Armenian composer, awarded by Konrad Adenauer prize.
He composed eight (completed) symphonies, an opera and several chamber works.
Several of his symphonies are recorded (the date 1973 in the Musicweb review of the Melodiya recording of symphony 3 is probably a typographical error, since the publisher's listing also gives 1975 for the first performance of that work.) Much of his music is available from.
Yekaterinburg's annual music festival is named after him.
