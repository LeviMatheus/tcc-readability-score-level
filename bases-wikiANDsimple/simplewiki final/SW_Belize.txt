Belize is a country in Central America. People in Belize speak English or Creole, instead of Spanish, which is what the people in the countries around it speak. This is because Belize was a former colony of Great Britain, while its neighbors were colonies of Spain. It was formerly called British Honduras.
Over two hundred and sixty thousand people live in Belize. Belmopan, which is located in the centre of the country, is its capital.
