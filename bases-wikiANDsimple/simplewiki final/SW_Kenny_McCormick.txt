Kenny McCormick is a fictional character in the animated television series "South Park". Kenny comes from a very poor family. He is the most cosmopolitan of the four boys. The others often ask him to explain sexual terms they do not understand. Kenny's voice is hard to understand because of his parka. This is done mainly because the things he says are usually vulgar. Even though his dialog is not understood by the viewer, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman can understand him clearly.
It was an on-going part during the earlier episodes of the series that Kenny dies in most of the episodes. His death is not permemant. He usually returned for the next episode but no characters ever talk about him having ever died.Kennys face is always somewhat hidden by his hoodie or other things that can cover his face.
