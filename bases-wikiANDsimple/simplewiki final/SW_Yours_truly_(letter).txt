Most of the time, the words "Yours truly" are used in English to end a letter politely. It is normally followed by the name of the letter's author.
Modern day.
In the UK, "Yours truly" has been replaced by "Yours sincerely" or "Yours faithfully".
Yours sincerely.
"Yours sincerely" is used when the person who is receiving the letter knows the author well and they can call each other by their first names.
Yours faithfully.
"Yours faithfully" is used when the person who is receiving the letter is not known by name (i.e. the recipient is addressed by a phrase such as "Dear Sir/Madam").
