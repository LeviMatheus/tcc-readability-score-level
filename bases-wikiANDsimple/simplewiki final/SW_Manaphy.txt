Manaphy is one of the 493 fictional species of Pokémon from the "Pokémon" franchise owned by Nintendo. Manaphy is a legendary Pokémon that first appeared in "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl". It also appeared in the "Pokémon" anime film, "Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea", which came out in 2006.
In video games.
It can only be caught in "Pokémon Diamond and Pearl" by finishing a mission in "Pokémon Ranger" which gives the player a Manaphy egg. The egg can then be imported to "Diamond" and "Pearl". When it hatches, the player is given a level 1 Manaphy. Manaphy can later become very strong and has high stats.
Manaphy is one of the few legendary Pokémon that can breed in the Day Care Center. However, it can only breed with Ditto, and the only eggs it can produce hatch into Phione. Phione can be considered a pre-evolved form of Manaphy, but it cannot evolve into Manaphy. The only ways to get multiple Manaphies are to trade with another player, or to use glitches in the games to clone Pokémon.
In anime.
Manaphy has never appeared in any episodes of the "Pokémon" anime, although it did appear in one film, "Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea" as one of the main characters.
