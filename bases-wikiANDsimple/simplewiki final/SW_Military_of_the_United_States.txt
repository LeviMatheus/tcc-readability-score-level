The President of the United States is the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
All branches except the Coast Guard are part of the Department of Defense, which is controlled by the Secretary of Defense.
About 1.4 million people are currently on active duty in the military with another 1,259,000 people on reserve (with 456,000 people in the Army and Air National Guard). There is currently no drafting. Women cannot serve in some combat positions, but they can serve in most non-combat Military Occupational Specialty. Because of war, some of these non-combat jobs actually see combat regularly.
