Margrethe II ("Margrethe Alexandrine 횧처rhildur Ingrid") (born 16 April 1940) is the Queen regnant of Denmark. Only very rarely is her name anglicized as Margaret II.
Early life.
Princess Margrethe was born at Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen, to Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Ingrid. She was baptised on 14 May 1940 at the Naval Church in Copenhagen. As King Christian X was also the King of Iceland at the time of her birth, the Princess was given an Icelandic name, "횧처rhildur" (spelled with the Icelandic thorn character, simplified as "th").
Margrethe was not born to be monarch, even though she was the eldest child of the Crown Prince, later King. At the time of her birth, only males could ascend the throne of Denmark.
The act of succession was changed in 1953.
Her father king Frederik IX died in 1972, and Queen Margrethe II became the first female Danish Sovereign.
