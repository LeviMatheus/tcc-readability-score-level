Michael Andrew Bridge Morpurgo OBE (born 5 October 1943) is a British writer. Michael Morpurgo grew up in London during a war there. He was a teacher, but the book "Poetry in the Making" by Ted Hughes, made him decide to write instead of teaching. He is the author of over one hundred books, mostly for children, many of which have given many prizes and awards.
Five of his books have been made into films. "My Friend Walter" (1988) and "Out of the Ashes" (2001) have both been made into television.
