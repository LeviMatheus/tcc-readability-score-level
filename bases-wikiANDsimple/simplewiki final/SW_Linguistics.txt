Linguistics is the science that studies language. Scientists who study language are called linguists.
Linguistics divides language in many levels to study it, like sounds (phonetics), structure of words (morphology), meaning of words (lexicology), and the structure of language itself (grammar). It also studies how people understand language (semantics) and how words combine (syntax).
Linguistics studies one language next to another to find similar properties. Doing that makes possible to find things shared by all the languages of the world.
