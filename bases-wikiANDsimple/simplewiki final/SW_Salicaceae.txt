"Salicaceae" is a family of flowering plants. Each plant has either staminate or pistillate catkins. The flowers have no petals or sepals. Each has a small scale-like bract below it. These developing catkins on willows form the well-known "pussy-willow" branches.
Except for two species of "Populas" (Cottonwood), all the members of "Salicaceae" in the Bay Area are of the genera "Salix" (Willows).
