An elector is someone who can vote in an election.
In the history of Germany an elector was a prince or archbishop who had the right to vote for the Emperor who ruled over the Holy Roman Empire. Sometimes they were called "Kurf√ºrsten" in German. They had a lot of power in their own district.
In the United States, electors are delegates who have the right to vote in the U.S. Electoral College for the President of the United States.
