Windsurfing is a water sport. It is done on a large board with a sail. The sail helps the board change directions. The sport is a combination of surfing and sailing. Windsurfers can travel on either flat or rough water, as long as there is wind. Windsurfing is done a lot in the summer and spring, as are almost all water sports. People who surf usually windsurf when there are no waves big enough for them to surf normally.
Windsurfing sails come in many different sizes. The larger the sails are, the more strength is needed to control them. The smaller sails are used for going faster. This is because they have less material to cut through the wind. Racing windsails are smaller. They can range in thickness depending on the materials. Another sport similar to surfing or windsurfing is kite surfing. All three of these sports have boards that range in size and price, but all need much practice to be done well. There are many sporting places around the world that people travel to just to go surfing. Some of the best places are in the west coast of the United States, Hawaii, Australia, and Indonesia.
