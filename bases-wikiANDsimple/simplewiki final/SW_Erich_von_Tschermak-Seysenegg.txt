Erich von Tschermak-Seysenegg (november 15 1871 – october 11 1962) was an Austrian agronomist.
Von Tschermak is one of three men - the others were Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns - who independently rediscovered Gregor Mendel's work on genetics. Von Tschermak published his findings in June, 1900.
By a quirk of history Correns was a student of Karl Wilhelm von Nägeli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas but who failed to understand how significant Mendel's work was. Von Tschermak was a grandson of a man who taught Mendel botany during his student days in Vienna.
