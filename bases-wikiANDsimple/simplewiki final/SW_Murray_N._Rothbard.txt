Murray Newton Rothbard (March 2, 1926 â€“ January 7, 1995) was an American economist of the Austrian School who helped define modern libertarianism and founded a form of free-market anarchism called by himself "anarcho-capitalism". Rothbard always thought about a spontaneous order and he didn't like the central planning in favour of an individualist anarchist conclusion.
