A catapult is a type of machine used as a weapon to shoot rocks or other things that would cause damage to something else. Catapults use weights and levers to send the rocks or other things into the air. They are simpler than other weapons more commonly used now and were more commonly used for war in the past, especially the Middle Ages. Nowadays catapults are used to study old weapons and by people that want to experience older war methods.
Sometimes, instead of rocks, pitch or hot tar would be thrown into the air to cause damage by setting the target on fire. Often catapults were set on higher ground or on castle towers to allow shooting more distance. They were also used to shoot rocks to break castle walls.
