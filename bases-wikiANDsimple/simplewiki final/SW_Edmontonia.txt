Edmontonia was a very protected dinosaur, of the nodosaur family from the Late Cretaceous Period. It is named after the Edmonton,in Canada. Edmontonia was very heavy and tank-like at roughly 7m (23 ft) long and 2m (6 ft) high. It had bony plates on its back and head, many sharp spikes along its back and tail and four large spikes jutting out from its shoulders on each side. These large spikes were probably used in contests of strength. To protect itself from predators, it probably would have crouched down on the ground to minimise the possibility of attack to its defenceless underbelly.
