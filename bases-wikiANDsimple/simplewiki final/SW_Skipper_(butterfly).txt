The Skippers are a group of insects in the order Lepidoptera, classified in the superfamily Hesperioidea, which includes only one family, the Hesperiidae.
Differences to butterflies.
Skippers differ in several important ways from the remaining butterflies, which are classified in the superfamily Papilionoidea and the neotropical superfamily Hedyloidea. Collectively, these three groups of butterflies share several characteristics especially in the egg, larval and pupal stage (Ackery et al. 1999). However, skippers have the antennae clubs hooked backward like a crochet. The other butterflies have club-like tips to their antennae and hedylids have feathered or pectinate antennae which give them an even more "moth"-like appearance than skippers. Skippers also have generally stockier bodies than the other two groups, with stronger wing muscles. Hesperioidea is very likely the sister group of Papilionoidea, and together with Hedyloidea constitute a natural group or clade.
Classification.
Note: Some authorities treat the Giant Skippers as a separate family, the Megathymidae, but more modern classifications place them within the subfamily Hesperiinae in the family Hesperiidae.
Many species of skippers look frustratingly alike. For example, some species in the genera "Erynnis", "Hesperia", and "Amblyscirtes" cannot currently be distinguished in the field by experts, the only reliable method of telling them apart involving dissection and examination of the genitalia.
