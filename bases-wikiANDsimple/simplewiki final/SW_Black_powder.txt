Black powder was the original gunpowder and practically the only known explosive until the middle of the 19th century. It has largely been replaced by more efficient explosives such as smokeless powders and TNT. It is still manufactured today but primarily for use in fireworks.
Description.
Black powder consists of the granular ingredients sulphur (S), charcoal (provides carbon to the reaction) and saltpetre (saltpetre, potassium nitrate, KNO3; provides oxygen to the reaction).
