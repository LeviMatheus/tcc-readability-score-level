Johnny Weir (born July 2, 1984 in Coatesville, Pennsylvania) is a figure skater from the United States. He won the United States national championships three times.
Weir had a late start in skating, starting at the age of 12. He had previously competed as an equestrian.
Weir and his family moved to Delaware so he could skate. Weir originally trained at the University of Delaware. Despite his late start, Weir was the World Junior Champion in 2001 at the age of sixteen. He and Evan Lysacek won the top two medals that year, becoming the first time since 1987 that the US had gone one-and-two at Junior Worlds.
In 2003, Weir was in second place after the short program at the national championships in Dallas. However, he literally hit the wall during the program and then had a bad fall on a jump. He withdrew in the middle of the program. As he left, he got a hug from Lysacek, who told he would see him back the next year.
Following that bad competition, Weir left the University of Delaware club and moved to The Pond ice arena. His coach Priscilla Hill came with him.
In 2004, Weir won the National championships. He repeated in 2005 and 2006.
For the 2005/2006 season, Weir had a short program to The Swan. This program has become iconic and has become part of American pop culture. It was mocked during the movie Blades of Glory and became iconic of the 2006 Olympics. Weir had the most success of his career with this short program. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Weir was second after the short program. After a long program in which he omitted the eighth jumping pass and did two combinations when three were allowed, he dropped to fifth place overall.
In 2007, Weir won the bronze medal at Nationals. After that season he switched coaches to Galina Zmievskaya, who previously coached Viktor Petrenko and Oksana Baiul to Olympic gold medals.
Weir is known for his smooth and elegant skating skills. Despite never studying ballet, he has very balletic movements. He is a very graceful and quiet skater with excellent basics. He is known as well for his flexiblity in spins. He is an inconsistent jumper. Although his triple axel is consistently one of the best in the world when it comes to smooth landings, he had landed only one quadruple jump in competition and it was not a clean quad. Weir is also known for only doing seven jumping passes instead of the allowed eight, which lost him an Olympic medal, a medal at the 2005 World Championships, and the silver medal at the 2007 Nationals. Weir has said that his focus for the future is on including the eighth jumping pass. Weir is often compared to Nobunari Oda, another graceful skater who has a problem counting jumps.
Weir lives and trains in New Jersey. He also works as a model. He has appeared in spreads in fashion magazines and walked the catwalk during New York Fasion Week.
