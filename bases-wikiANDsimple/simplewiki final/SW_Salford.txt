Salford is a city in England. It was made a free borough by Ranulf, Earl of Chester in about 1230. and was granted city status in 1926. Salford is unusual because it borders the city of Manchester at its center, rather than its outskirts. The two cities are divided by the River Irwell.
Salford shares the industrial history of its neighbour Manchester. It hosts several world class museums and art centres, chiefly: The Lowry and the Imperial War Museum, both on Salford Quays.
