Cream was a British rock band in the late 1960s. They played and recorded together from 1966 to 1969. The members of the group were Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker. They were called a power trio, since there were three musicians, who all played essential roles in the band.
Cream's hit records included the songs "Strange Brew", "Sunshine Of Your Love" and "White Room". Their last album, titled "Goodbye Cream", included a song called "Badge", co-written by Eric Clapton and George Harrison of The Beatles.
