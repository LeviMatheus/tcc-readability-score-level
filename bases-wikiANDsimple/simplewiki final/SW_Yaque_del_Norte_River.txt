The Yaque Del Norte River is the longest river in the Dominican Republic. The river rises in the center of the country to the south of Santiago city in Santiago province. The river runs roughly due north, through Santiago, before turning west-north-west through the Cibao Valley. It enters the Manzanillo Bay in the Atlantic just west of Monte Cristi. The river is 208 km long, is the drainage basin for the north-west of the country and is economically important as a source of irrigation for rice-farming and other agriculture.
