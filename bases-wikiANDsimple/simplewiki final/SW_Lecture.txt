A lecture is when someone talks to a group of people about something interesting. It is like a lesson. At college or university students go to lectures to learn things. The person who is teaching (talking to the group) is called the lecturer.
Sometimes we say that someone was "given a lecture". This means that he was told off for doing something wrong.
