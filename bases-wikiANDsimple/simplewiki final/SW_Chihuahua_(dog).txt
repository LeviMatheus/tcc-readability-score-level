Origins.
Chihuahua's origins go back to Pre-Columbian Mexico as the descendants of the Techichi, a long haired, mute dog. The Techichi was favored by the Toltec people. Toltecs made their capital in Tula, in the Mesa Central Region. They also built the city of Teotihuacan near present day Mexico City. Chihuahuas are believed to be bred by Techichi and Chinese Crested dogs (tiny and hairless) to form modern Chihuahuas. Another possible theory is that Techichis were bred with Spanish terriers, which were popular at the time and were known for their small build and black and tan coloration. Breeding with another species of dog, increased the Techichi's bark while decreasing it's size. Chihuahuas were named after the Chihuahua state in Mexico, which is the place where the breed became known for it's popularity in the United States. The name Chihuahua has nothing to do with the dog itself. Instead, the word Chihuahua comes from the Na'huatl word "xicuagua", which means, "sandy, dry place".
