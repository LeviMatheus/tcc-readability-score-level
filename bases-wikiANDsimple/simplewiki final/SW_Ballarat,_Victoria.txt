History.
Tribes of Australian Aborigines, the Wathaurang and the Borneghurk, used to rest here, and called it "Balla-arat" meaning "elbow-place."
The first people from Europe came to Ballarat in 1837 to be sheep farmers. They took over large areas of land, with some farms more than 400 square kilometres. By 1840 there were more than 20 farms with 1000's of sheep in the Ballarat area. The city area was a farm owned by William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson who arrived in 1838.
Gold was found at Ballarat in late August 1851, by James Regan and John Dunlop and within three weeks there were nearly 1000 people digging in the area looking for gold. In 2 days the Cavanagh brothers dug up 27.2 kilograms of gold from a hole less than 2 metres deep. This area is now called "Golden Point". Within a year there were 20,000 people living in Ballarat. With so many people coming to look for gold, the town soon got bigger. The Post Office opened on November 1, 1851.
Ballarat is famous as the site for an uprising, or rebellion. This is known as the Eureka Stockade or the Eureka Rebellion, which took place on 3 December 1854. About 30 miners were killed. This is an important moment in Australian history. The site now has a museum and display about the rebellion. The rebel miners flag can be seen at the Ballarat Fine Art Gallery.
