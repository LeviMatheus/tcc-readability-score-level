The Persian Empire (Persian: شاهنشاهی ایران - "Shahanshahi-e Iran") is the name for a few empires, that ruled over modern-day Iran.
The best-known of those empires is probably the Achaemenid Empire.
It was formed under Cyrus the Great who took over the empire of the Medes. He conquered the territories of the Babylonians, Assyrians, the Phoenicians, and the Lydians. It had land that went west from Iran to Turkey. It existed from about 550 BC to about 330 BC. The Greek city states fought against the Persian armies led by Darius and Xerxes.
The third Persian empire was the Sassanid Empire.
Most of the following states in Greater Iran before to March 1935 are collectively called the "Persian Empire" by Western historians.
