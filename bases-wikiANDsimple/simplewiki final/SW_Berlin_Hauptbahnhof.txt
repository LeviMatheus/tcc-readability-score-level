Berlin Hauptbahnhof is the central railway station of the German capital Berlin. It began full operation two days after a ceremonial opening on May 26, 2006.
It is on the site of the old Lehrter Bahnhof. Until it opened as a main line station, it was a stop on the Berlin S-Bahn suburban railway temporarily named Berlin Hauptbahnhof â€“ Lehrter Bahnhof from 2002.
The station is the largest in terms of traffic volume in Europe (for a through-station, as opposed to a head-station). The largest station Europe in terms of traffic volume is Paris Gare du Nord but, if it is also a through-station for most local ones, it is obviously a head station for long-range trains.
The longest route that runs through Berlin Hauptbanhof is the Sibirjak. It links Berlin to some cities in Russia. It passes through Poland, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. The longest route offered goes to Novosibirsk. This takes almost four days to travel.
