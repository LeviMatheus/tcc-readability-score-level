A wife is a married woman. "Married" means that the law says they are legally "joined".
In coutries and times it has been different how many wives can a man have legally. In old times there was no limitations in some countries. In christianity a man can have one wife. In Islam a man can have up to four wives.
There are some names for special kinds of wives. For example,
a queen is a wife of a king.
If a child is born between a man and his wife, this child is thought as a legitimate (lawful) child. In contrary a child between a man and a woman who is not his wife is called illegitimate child or a bastard. Though out of wedlock children have lost a social stigma in many western countries where common-law relationships are becoming much more common.
A man whose wife is deceased is called a widower.
