Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (November 15, 1891 â€“ October 14, 1944) was an officer of the German army in World War II. He commanded big battles in northern Africa that made him very well known. He was defeated at El Alamein.
The German people and many of Allies thought well of him, but the Nazis thought he was plotting against the government, so he was forced to commit suicide in 1944.
