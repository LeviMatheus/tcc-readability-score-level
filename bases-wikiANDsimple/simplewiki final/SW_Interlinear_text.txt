Interlinear text is text on several lines where additional lines give explanations of the main text. That can be a transliteration or a translation of each word of the main line (literal translation) or a free translation of the entire main text line.
Interlinear text is usually used to translate or explain the main text. It is used frequently in foreign language learning material and linguistic literature. Latin text books and Greek or Hebrew Bibles with interlinears are common examples.
