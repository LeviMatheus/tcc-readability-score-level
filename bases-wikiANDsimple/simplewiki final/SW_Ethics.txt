Ideas about ethics.
Some philosophers call ethics the "science of morality".
"Morality" is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad.
There are many different moralities, but they share some things.
For example most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong.
Some philosophers hope to find more things that moralities share.
They think that ethics should use the scientific method to study things that people think are good or bad.
Other philosophers think that ethics is separate from morality.
They do not think that ethics can be studied using the scientific method and they think it is closer to metaphysics.
Some of them think like platonists about what is good and bad.
Other philosophers believe that ethics is subjective.
This means that they think that what is right for me is whatever I say is right.
This means that ethics is just a person's own morality.
These philosophers do not think that ethics is the same for all people.
What is ethics used for?
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.
Along with Aesthetics ethics forms part of axiology the philosophy of what people like.
