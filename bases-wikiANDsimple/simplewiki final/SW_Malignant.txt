In medicine, malignant is a clinical term that is used to describe an illness that quickly kills the patient. Strictly speaking, a malignant tumour is a tumour that is able to invade nearby tissues and spread to tissues that are not nearby. Not all patients diagnosed with malignant tumours die because of the improved treatments available. The actual prognosis depends of the type of tumour, its differentiation, and how bad the disease is. The term malignant is typically applied to neoplasms that show aggressive behaviour characterised by local invasion or distant metastasis.
