The land hemisphere is the hemisphere on the Earth with the highest possible area of land. It is centered on (near the city of Nantes, France). The other half of the Earth is the water hemisphere.
The land hemisphere has seven eighths of the land on the Earth. Europe, Africa, North America, most of Asia and most of South America are in the land hemisphere. Europe is at the center of the land hemisphere. However, because the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is still bigger than its land area, the land hemisphere means the hemisphere where most land is, but not the hemisphere where the land area is bigger than the ocean area.
