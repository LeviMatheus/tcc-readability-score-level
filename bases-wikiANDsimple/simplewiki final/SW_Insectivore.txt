An insectivore is an animal or insect that eats mostly insects for food. An Anteater is an animal that eats ants. There are also some plants that eat insects. One plant that is an insectivore is called a Venus fly-trap.
To eat insects for food is not very easy because it takes many insects to make enough food for an insect-eating animal. Anteaters eat hundreds of ants every day.
Some omnivores like humans and bears also eat insects for food.
