"The Three Bears" or "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" is a children's story.
It is about a little girl named Goldilocks. She gets lost in the woods and finds a house where three bears live. The bears are not at home.
Curious, she enters the house and uses the bears' things, tasting their porridge (eating all of the baby's bowl), sitting on their chairs (breaking the baby's one), and then trying out their beds (falling asleep in the baby's one). Every member of the bear family has their own unique chair, porridge, and bed, which have unique characteristics. The mother and father's beds and chairs are "too hard" and "too soft" and their porridges are "too hot" and "too cold", with the baby bear's porridge, chair, and bed being "just right".
Goldilocks is still asleep in the baby's bed when the bears return home. They wake her up, and depending on the version of the story, either kill her or scare her away.
