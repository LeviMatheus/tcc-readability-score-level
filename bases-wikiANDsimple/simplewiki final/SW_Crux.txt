Crux (IPA: /ˈkrʊks/, Latin: cross), commonly known as the Southern Cross (in contrast to the Northern Cross), is one of the modern constellations. It can only be seen in the southern hemisphere. It points to the directions of north, south, east and west.
In the olden days sailors used to use Crux as a means of navigation.
