A hero (rom the Greek word "ἣρως") in Greek mythology was a half-god or otherwise powerful human. They were also worshipped in hero cults.
Later, hero (male) or heroine (female) meant people who are good, moral, and courageous; they have heroism. They help in saving people or a society from bad people, villains, or any natural disasters. A hero can also be someone who is helpful, polite, or helping people who need it.
Sometimes, the protagonist (or main character) of a story is called the "hero" of the work (a book/film/etc.).
