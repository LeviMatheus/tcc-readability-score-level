Macroeconomics studies the economic decisions of a large group of people; for example, a whole country's economy. Many governments use macroeconomics to decide how much tax to collect, and what interest rates should be.
Macroeconomics also looks at exchange rates. For example, if a country has a high exchange rate, not many people will want to buy its expensive products. So the demand will be lower, and so will the prices.
