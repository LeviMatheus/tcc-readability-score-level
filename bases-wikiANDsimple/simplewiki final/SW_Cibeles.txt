Cibeles is the name given to the marble fountain found in the Plaza de Cibeles (Cibele's Square) on the Paseo de la Castellana. It is on a very busy road crossing. The statue was made by Ventura Rodriguez. King Carlos III asked to have it made in 1716. It has changed several times. It was moved to the central position in 1895.
The lady is the Goddess of Fertility. She sits on a chariot pulled by lions. The lions' names are Hippomenes and Atalanta. They were people that the goddess turned into lions because they ruined her temple. The lions were made by Robert Michel.
There are other very important buildings around Cibeles: the Palacio de Communicaciones (Main Post Office), the Banco de España, Palacio de Buenavista (army headquarters) and the Palacio de Linares (Casa de América). When Real Madrid wins an important sports event, the players often go to the Plaza de Cibeles to celebrate.
