Trotskyism is the form of Communism that is based on the ideas of Leon Trotsky. Trotsky described himself as an "orthodox Marxist". This is a different way of seeing the ideas of Karl Marx than the way other communists like Mao Zedong and Josif Stalin saw them. The biggest difference is in Trotsky's idea that there needs to be an international "permanent revolution". A permanent revolution is the idea that communism needed to spread in countries that were not communist, especially where capitalism was not as advanced. This is different to the Stalinist idea of trying to preserve a single nation's revolution from within.
The largest Trotskyist organization today is the Reunified Fourth International.
