Satguru or Sadguru means "true guru". (Sanskrit सदगुरू sat=true), literally: true teacher. The title means that his students have faith that the guru can be trusted and will lead them to moksha, enlightenment or inner peace. It is based on a long line of Hindu understandings about the importance of the guru.
Ancient and traditional sources.
The Kularnava Tantra (XIV/65) states,
"It is very rare to find a Satguru who can give "Shaktipat" and rare to find a disciple worthy of receiving it. One gets such a Guru only as a result of past meritorious actions."
In the Upanishads, five signs of satguru (true guru) are mentioned.
In the presence of the satguru; Knowledge flourishes ("Gyana raksha"); Sorrow diminishes ("Dukha kshaya"); Joy wells up without any reason ("Sukha aavirbhava"); Abundance dawns ("Samriddhi"); All talents manifest ("Sarva samvardhan").
According to Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, a Hindu Satguru is always a "sannyasin", an unmarried renunciate.
