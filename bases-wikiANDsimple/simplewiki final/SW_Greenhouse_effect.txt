The greenhouse effect occurs when certain gasses in the atmosphere trap infrared radiation. This effect makes the planet warmer than it would be without a greenhouse effect.
The greenhouse effect is caused by greenhouse gasses; the most important greenhouse gasses in Earth's atmosphere are: water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane.
Recently, the greenhouse effect has gotten stronger. Scientists believe this is because humans have been using large amounts of fossil fuels, which release carbon dioxide when they are burned. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it has caused the planet to warm over the past 150 years.
The greenhouse effect was first discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824. Mars, Venus and other planets with atmospheres also have greenhouse effects.
