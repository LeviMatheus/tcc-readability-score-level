To possess is to have or to own. "I possess all my teeth," means I still have all I was born with. "The woman possesses five cars," means she owns five cars. A "possession" is something you own. "My only "possessions" are my cat and my brains."
In some beliefs, to be possessed is to be under the control of devils, demons, or evil spirits. These people may do evil or terrible things because of their "possession." Sometimes this "possession" was because the person had epilepsy. As the reasons for epilepsy were not known people decided it was caused by evil.
