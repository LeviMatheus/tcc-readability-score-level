Anglicanism is the term used for the doctrine, religious belief, faith, system, practice and principles of the Church of England and other Anglican churches. The term at its broadest "includes those who have accepted the work of the English Reformation as embodied in the Church of England or in the offshoot Churches which in other countries have adhered, at least substantially, to its doctrines, its organization, and its liturgy."
The term Anglican derives from a Medieval Latin phrase dating to at least 1246 - "ecclesia anglicana" -meaning 'the English Church'. The noun Anglican is used to describe the people, institutions and churches as well as the liturgical traditions and theological concepts developed by the state established Church of England and the Anglican Communion, a theologically broad and often divergent affiliation of thirty-eight provinces that are in communion with the Archbishop of Canterbury.
