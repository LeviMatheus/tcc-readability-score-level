"Hybrid Theory EP" is an EP by the American nu metal/alternative rock band Linkin Park that was recorded and released in 1999. At this time, Linkin Park were called "Hybrid Theory", making this EP a self-titled album, or an album named after the band.
It was Linkin Park's first record. Before it, in 1997, the band only made a demo tape called "Xero". The band changed its name later in 1999, after Chester Bennington replaced Mark Wakefield as the lead singer.
About the EP.
Only one thousand were made, and the EP was sent to different record labels, such as Warner Bros. Records. The rest of the copies of the EP were sent to the first members of Linkin Park's fan club.
On November 19, 2001, Linkin Park Underground, Linkin Park's fan club, was made. The first fan club package that was sent to members had a new edition of "Hybrid Theory EP", with a note from the band. The first 500 copies of the CD were signed by all 6 members of the band.
The only ways to get the EP are to buy it from eBay, or win a contest in the Linkin Park Underground when the EP is awarded as a contest prize. But the prizes awarded by the LPU are the original EP.
