Excommunication is a religious act used to take off or suspend membership in a religious community.
The word literally means "out of communion", or "no longer in communion". In some churches, excommunication includes spiritual condemnation of the member or group. Sometimes sanctions "follow" excommunication; these include banishment, shunning, and shaming, depending on the group's religion or religious community.
