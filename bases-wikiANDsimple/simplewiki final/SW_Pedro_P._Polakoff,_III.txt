Pedro P. Polakoff III is a freelance photographer based in Philadelphia, known for his role in the Mumia Abu-Jamal case. Polakoff took photographs of the crime scene at 13th and Locust St., where police officer Daniel Faulkner was killed. Polakoff arrived at the scene minutes before the Mobile Crime Unit (a division of the police that is involved in forensics and photography), and was the only press photographer on the scene. The photos are important to the case as they point to things that should not have been done and could have corrupted evidence (tampering). This includes a photograph of Officer James Forbes holding two guns, Mumia Abu-Jamal's and Faulkner's, in his bare hand. Another photograph, which depicted a hat on the roof of the Volkswagen that belonged to Billy Cook (Abu-Jamal's brother), showed that the hat had been moved, as in the official police photograph, the hat was on the ground.
