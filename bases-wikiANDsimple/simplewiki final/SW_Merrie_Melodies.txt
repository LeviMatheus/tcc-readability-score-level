"Merrie Melodies" is the name of a series of animated cartoons distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures between 1931 and 1969. The sister series to Warner's "Looney Tunes", "Merrie Melodies" were originally one-shot musical cartoon shorts before gradually featuring recurring characters.
By 1944, no distinctions existed between the two series.
Originally produced by Harman-Ising Pictures, "Merrie Melodies" were produced by Leon Schlesinger Productions from 1933 to 1944. Schlesinger sold his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944, and the newly renamed Warner Bros. Cartoons continued production until 1963.
