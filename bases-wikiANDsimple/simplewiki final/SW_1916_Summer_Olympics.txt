The anticipated 1916 Summer Olympics, which were to be officially known as the Games of the VI Olympiad, were to have been held in Berlin, Germany. When World War I started in 1914, organization of the Games continued because no one thought the war would continue for four years. The games were eventually cancelled. Germany won the bid for the Games over Alexandria and Budapest.
A winter sports week with speed skating, figure skating, ice hockey and nordic skiing was planned. The main stadium would have been the Deutsche Stadion (German Stadium), which was built in 1912 â€“ 13. Berlin returned to Olympic bidding in 1931 when it beat Barcelona, Spain for the right to host the 1936 Summer Olympics.
