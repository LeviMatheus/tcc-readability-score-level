Derek Taylor (1932 â€“ 1997) was a English journalist and author. He spent most of his career covering popular music and celebrity news. He had a long association with rock band The Beatles, serving at different times as their press agent.

In the mid-1960s, Taylor lived with his family in Los Angeles, California, and had his own public relations agency. His clients included The Byrds and The Beach Boys. He also gave Harry Nilsson's career a boost, when he sent copies of Nilsson's album "Pandemonium Shadow Show" to important members of the music industry, including the Beatles.
