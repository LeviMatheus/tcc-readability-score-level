The Curl-crested Manucode ("Manucodia comrii") is a large bird of paradise, about 43cm long, with glossy purple, black and green plumage, red iris and crinkled yellowish-green upper breast and neck feathers. It has curled head feathering and twisted central tail feathers. It is the largest species of Manucode, and also the largest species in its family in terms of body size, though its tail is shorter than the Black Sicklebill.
It is found in the Trobriand Islands and islands of the D'Entrecasteaux Archipelago. This species is also one of the largest and heaviest among birds of paradise. They eat fruits.
The British zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater named this species after Dr. Peter Comrie, who discovered the bird at Fergusson Island in 1874.
