European Football Championship 2008.
The Wankdorf was one of the venues for the Euro 2008. There were played 3 group games. For the Euro 2008 they had to change the artificial turf. They put natural turf. After the event the stadium had again his usual ground. The reason for the artificial turf is that the stadium can also be used for concerts. So artist like Bon Jovi, Robbie Williams, Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer and bands like Genesis were there.

All the seats are black or yellow, but there is only one red seat in sector A. It is called the hot seat. It's created for former player of Young Boys or prominent visitors. The first who sat on that seat was the most successful goalkeeper of Young Boys, Walter Eirich
