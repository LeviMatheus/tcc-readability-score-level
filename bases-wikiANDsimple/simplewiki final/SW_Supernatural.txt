The word supernatural is used for things that some people believe are real, but that are not part of nature. Because we cannot prove whether these things are real, people often disagree about these things.
Scientists say that we should talk about things without talking about the supernatural, because we cannot prove that supernatural things are real. Other people say that although we cannot prove supernatural things in a scientific way, they are real. Many ideas like religion, magic, miracles, spirits, ghosts, angels, devils, gods, and God are supernatural.
Fiction.
In comic books, the superhero is a person with supernatural abilities and tries to hide them. In books, a character (Usually Fantasy, or Science fiction) has some sort of supernatural powers.
For example: A witch who can cast magic.
