Music video.
The video for this song was directed by Jake Nava, who had risen to popularity after directing Beyoncé's first two videos, "Crazy In Love" and "Baby Boy." The video pays tribute to Hollywood's Golden Era, as Beyoncé and the cast of the video are dressed in old fashioned, glamorous clothing and hairstyles. As the title of the song suggest, Beyoncé plays the role of the naughty girl in several sexy sequences, as she can be seen dancing seductively with Usher emulating Cyd Charisse and Fred Astaire in "The Band Wagon".
