Woody Allen (born Allen Stewart KÃ¶nigsberg on December 1, 1935) is an American film director, writer, actor, jazz musician, comedian, and playwright, who has won the Academy Award three times, as well as many others in his very long career.
His many works and his cerebral film style, mixing satire and humor, have made him one of the most respected film directors in the modern era. Allen writes and directs his movies and has also acted in most of them. To inspire himself for his movies, Allen uses literature, philosophy, psychology, Judaism, European cinema and New York City, where he was born and has lived all life.
