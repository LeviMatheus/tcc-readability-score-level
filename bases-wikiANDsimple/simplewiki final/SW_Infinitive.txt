An infinitive is a special type of a verb. It has no person, no number, no mood and no tense.
After a modal verb you must use an infinitive. For example: "I must go", "he must go" ("he must goes" is not correct)
In German, the infinitives end with "-en", "-eln" or "-ern". There are 2 exceptions - "sein" (to be) and "tun" (to do).
In Esperanto, the infinitives end with "-i", for example "dormi" (to sleep)
