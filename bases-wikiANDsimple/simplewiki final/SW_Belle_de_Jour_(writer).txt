Belle de Jour is promoted as the "pen name" of a former London call girl. Under this name she maintains a successful blog, "Belle de Jour: diary of a London call girl" which by 2003 had been selected by "The Guardian" as its blog of the year and has had two books published in both the UK and US
The name recalls the 1928 novel "Belle de jour" by Joseph Kessel and the 1967 Belle de jour starring Catherine Deneuve, directed by Luis Bu√±uel.
In French "Belle de Jour" is an expression translating literally as "beauty of [the] day," as opposed to "femme de nuit" or "belle de nuit," women of the night (common references to prostitutes).
