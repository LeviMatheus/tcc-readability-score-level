The Israel-West-Bank barrier is a wall being built the State of Israel to separate the West Bank of the Jordan River from Israel. As of 2007, the wall is currently being built. Some who oppose the building of the wall call it the Apartheid Wall, likening the border with the apartheid system that ruled South Africa (see global apartheid). The problem with this is that so far, the borders between Israel and the Palestinian Territories have not been agreed upon. Israel has built the barrier without consensus and against international law. The fence therefore only takes into account what Israel sees as these borders. This will make talks about the borders more difficult.
Very often, the fence or wall has been compared to the Berlin Wall, which divided Berlin in the time where there were two states of Germany, East Germany and West Germany.
