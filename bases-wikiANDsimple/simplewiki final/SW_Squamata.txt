Squamata (meaning "scaled reptiles") is the order of reptiles, including lizards and snakes. This members of the order are distinguished by their skins, which bear horny scales or shield. They also possess movable quadrate bones, making it possible to move the upper jaw relative to the braincase. This is also the only reptile group in which can be found both viviparous and ovoviviparous species, as well as the usual oviparous reptiles.
The Squamata do not include the tuataras from New Zealand reptiles resembling lizards.
