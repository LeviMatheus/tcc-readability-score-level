Visible light is the light that can be seen by the human eye. It is a small part of the spectrum of light and radiation given off by stars like the sun.
The human eye sees three different kinds of light: red, green, and blue. The brain combines them. Computer screens use only these three colors in different brightness levels.
Rainbows show the entire spectrum of visible light. The separate colors, moving in from the outer edges, are usually listed as red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Other colors can be seen only with special cameras: outside of red is infrared, and inside of violet is ultraviolet.
