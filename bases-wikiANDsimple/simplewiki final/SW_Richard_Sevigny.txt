Richard Sevigny (November 4, 1957 in Montreal, Quebec) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender who played for the Montreal Canadiens and Quebec Nordiques in the National Hockey League. In the 1979 Stanley Cup Finals Michel Larocque was scheduled to start game two. Laroque was injured during the pre-game warm up and Sevigny was started instead. The Canadiens would win that year and Sevigny's name was engraved on the Stanley Cup before ever playing an NHL game. In the off season Ken Dryden retired, and Richard Sevigny earned a spot on the roster for the 1979–80 NHL season. Richard won the 1981 Vezina Trophy along with Denis Herron and Michel Larocque with Montreal. After being released by the Canadiens in 1984, Sevigny spent the next three seasons between the Quebec Nordiques and their American Hockey League affiliate in Fredericton, New Brunswick before finishing his career in France. He was, before 1990–91, player-coach of the Diables Rouges de Briançon.
According to hockey legends, Sevigny was quoted as saying that Guy Lafleur would have Wayne Gretzky in his back pocket during the 1981 playoffs, a quote that motivated the Oilers team to victory over the fabled Habs.
Sevigny has involved himself in old-timers charity hockey games and has coached the semi-pro Verdun Dragons.
