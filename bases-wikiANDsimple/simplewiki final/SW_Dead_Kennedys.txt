The Dead Kennedys were a hardcore punk band from San Francisco. The band was led by Jello Biafra. The band played songs with strong political messages. During the 1980s, the band had many fans (people who liked their music) in the punk rock music scene.
The Dead Kennedys formed in June 1978. In 1980, one of their songs called "California Ãœber Alles" became popular in the punk music scene. In 1980, they recorded and released an song called "Holiday in Cambodia". That same year, the band released their first album, "Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables". In the early 1980s, the band toured all over the United States, Europe and Australia.
In January of 1986, the band broke up. After the band broke up, they were charged with the crime of obscenity. A person who saw the band's album "Frankenchrist" complained to the Attorney General for the State of California and to Los Angeles prosecutors. The album included a picture that depicted nine penises. In August of 1987, the criminal trial ended with a hung jury (the jury could not make a decision). The album was banned from many record stores in the United States.
