Taiga (IPA pronunciation:, from Mongolian) is characterized by coniferous forests. Taiga covers most of inland Alaska, Canada, Sweden, Finland, inland Norway, northern Kazakhstan and Russia (especially Siberia), as well as parts of the extreme northern continental United States. The taiga is the world's largest region with forests. In Canada, boreal forest is the term used to refer to the southern part of these forests, while "taiga" is used to describe the northern areas south of the Arctic tree line.
