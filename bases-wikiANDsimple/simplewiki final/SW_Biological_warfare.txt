Biological warfare (or germ warfare) is when pathogens are used as a weapon. This is called a biological weapon. Pathogens are organisms that can cause disease. If non-living things (like toxins) are used, this is considered to be chemical warfare.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War, biological weapons were used by the Japanese army against China. The Japanese army usually launched contaminated fleas or food from planes.
Today, pathogens for diseases like anthrax or smallpox could be used as agents for biological weapons.
The production, and stockpiling of such weapons was forbidden in the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972
