A glossary is a list of words and what they mean. They are usually found at the end of a book or report that uses difficult or special words. Websites about complicated subjects sometimes have glossaries also.
For example, in a book about philosophy that has the word "epistemology", there might be a glossary at the end of the book with the definition of this word.
