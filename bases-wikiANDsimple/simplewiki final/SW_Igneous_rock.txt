Igneous rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) cools down to form crystals or minerals. Examples are granite and basalt. The word "igneous" is derived from the Latin "ignis", meaning "fire", another way to learn this is Igneous "Ignite". Igneous rocks would be found near volcanoes.
Magma is made up of atoms and molecules of melted minerals. When magma cools the atoms and molecules rearrange to form mineral grains. Rock forms when minerals grains grow together
Igneous volcanic glass are pumice, obsidian, and scoria and much more. These rocks cool very fast and leave minerals behind and form these rocks. it's just solidified magma that has minerals or none in it floating with a lot of elements like silicon and aluminum. These rocks make up 95% of the Earths crust.
Intrusive igneous rocks form when earth's magma cools beneath the surface until hardened. Extrusive igneous rocks form when earth's magma is forced to the surface where it cools until hardened. Most igneous rocks are porous.
