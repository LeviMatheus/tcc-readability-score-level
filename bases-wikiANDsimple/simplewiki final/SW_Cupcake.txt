A cupcake (or fairy cake) is a small cake made to serve one person, usually made in a small paper cup container. As with larger cakes, icing and other decorations, such as sprinkles, are often put on them.
Similar to American-style muffins, cupcakes are often served during a celebration, such as children's classroom birthday parties. They are a convenient alternative to cake because they do not require plates, utensils, or dividing into pieces because they are small. Cupcakes were first invented in the early 1800's.
A simple cupcake uses the same ingredients as most other standard cakes - using butter, sugar, eggs, and flour.
