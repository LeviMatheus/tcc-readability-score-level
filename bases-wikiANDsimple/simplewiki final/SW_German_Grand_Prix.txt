The German Grand Prix ("Großer Preis von Deutschland") is an automobile race held every year. The Grand Prix motorcycle racing event is also called the German GP but this article concentrates on the automobile GP.
As Germany was banned from taking part in international events after World War II, the German GP only became part of the Formula One World Championship in 1951. It has been organized by AvD (Automobile Club of Germany) since 1926. The well-known ADAC hosts many other races, one of which has been the second F1 race in Germany at the Nürburgring, held there since 1995.
