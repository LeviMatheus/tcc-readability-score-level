108 Hecuba is a fairly big and bright main belt asteroid.
Hecuba orbits within the Hygiea family of asteroids but is not otherwise related to other family members because it is made of silicate. Hygieas are dark C-type asteroids.
It was found by R. Luther on April 2, 1869 and named after Hecuba, wife of King Priam in the legends of the Trojan War.
