An Amphitheatre (or "Amphitheater") is a type of structure. It can be either man-made or natural. It is an flat area, sourrounded by an area that ascends gradually. In the ascending area, people can be seated. Today, such structures are used for presentations, but also spectator sports. In Ancient Rome these structures were used to entertain the population. Gladiator combats, animal hunts, and executions were staged there.
