The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is a spin-off organisation from the United Nations. It was created as an autonomous (self-governing) organization on July 29, 1957. The organisation wants to monitor and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy. It also wants to prevent the use of this energy to build nuclear weapons.
The organization and its Director General, Mohamed ElBaradei, were both awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on 7 October 2005. This was done for their role when they tried to prevent the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition of troops.
The IAEA has its headquarters in Vienna, Austria. Additional facilities are located in Seibersdorf (near Vienna), Monaco, Toronto, and Tokyo.
