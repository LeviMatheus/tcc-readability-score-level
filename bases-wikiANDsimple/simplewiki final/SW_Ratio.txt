A ratio between two quantities "A" and "B" is their fraction "A/B". A ratio is a mathematical way of expressing the proportion of "A" to "B". For example, if I bought 20 apples and have only 9 left, what is the proportion (or ratio) of 9 to 20? The answer is 9/20 or 0.45/1. The ratio may also be written as 0.45. Ratios can be changed into percentages, fractions and decimals.
