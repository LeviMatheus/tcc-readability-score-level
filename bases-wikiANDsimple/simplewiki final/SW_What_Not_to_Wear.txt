"What Not to Wear" is a makeover reality show that is aired on the BBC. The reality show is now presented by Mica Paris and Lisa Butcher, but before them, it was presented by the fashion experts Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine.
On the show "What Not to Wear", every episode there is a makeover of a man or woman who is very unfashionable. The person who is having the makeover is given Â£2000/$5000 to go shopping and buy new fashionable clothes with the two hosts who give them advice. The makeover helps the person to have a better appearance and be more fashionable.
