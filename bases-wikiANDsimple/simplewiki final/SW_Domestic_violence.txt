Domestic violence is a word used by many people. People use it to say that in a relationship or marriage, one of the partners uses physical or psychological violence to try to solve problems. Men very often resort to physical violence, women very often use psychological violence.
In many countries, there are no laws to directly solve this problem. However, very often laws exist to protect the victim of such violent acts. There are also organisations that can help in such situations.
The problem though is that very often, such cases do not get reported to the police. Eastimates say that only a third of the cases (or even less) get reported to the authorities.
