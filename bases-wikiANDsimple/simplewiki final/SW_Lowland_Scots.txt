Lowland Scots, sometimes called simply "Scots" or sometimes "Lallans", is spoken in some parts of Scotland, mainly in the south and east, and Ulster in the north of Ireland. Some people consider Scots to be a language and some consider it to be a form of English. It should not be confused with the Scottish Gaelic language, which is a Celtic language.
Scots differs from standard English in vocabulary and grammar, and it is not the same as English with a Scottish accent. Activists for Scots have pressured the government of the United Kingdom to recognise it as a regional language of the United Kingdom.
The most famous writer of literature in Lowland Scots is Robert Burns.
