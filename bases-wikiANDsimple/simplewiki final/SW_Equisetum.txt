"Equisetum" (also horsetails or scouring rushes), is a genus of vascular plants that reproduce by spores and not by seeds.
The genus includes 15 species.
The name horsetail, often used for the entire group, arose because the branched species somewhat resemble a horse's tail, the name "Equisetum" comes from the Latin "equus", "horse", and "seta", "bristle".
One can find horsetails on all continents except from Australasia and Antarctica. They are perennial plants, either herbaceous, they back in winter (most temperate species) or they are evergreen (some tropical species, and the temperate species "Equisetum hyemale, E. scirpoides, E. variegatum" and "E. ramosissimum"). They mostly grow 0.2-1.5 m tall, though "E. telmateia" can exceptionally reach 2.5 m, and the tropical American species "E. giganteum" 5 m, and "E. myriochaetum" 8 m.
In these plants the leaves are greatly reduced, in whorls of small, segments fused into nodal sheaths. The stems are green and photosynthetic, also distinctive in being hollow, jointed, and ridged (with (3-) 6-40 ridges). There may or may not be whorls of branches at the nodes; when present, these branches are identical to the main stem except smaller.
The superficially similar flowering plant, Mare's tail ("Hippuris vulgaris"), unrelated to the genus "Equisetum", is occasionally misidentified and misnamed as a horsetail.
