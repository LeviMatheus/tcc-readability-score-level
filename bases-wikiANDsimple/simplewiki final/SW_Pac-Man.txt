"Pac-Man" is an arcade video game that was made by Namco. It was released in 1980, and became popular with boys and girls.
In Pac-Man, the player makes a Pac-Man,a yellow disc move around a maze. The goal is to eat every yellow pellet (circles) while not getting caught by the ghosts/monsters. For extra points, fruits that appear can also be eaten. When Pac-Man eats a white pellet, the ghosts turn blue and can be eaten. Even though the game has 256 stages, the last level can't be finished due to a problem with the creation of the game.
The game is called Puck Man in Japan. The game was named Pac-Man in the United States. There were many sequels and remakes based on the game. Hanna-Barbera made a animated tv show airing on ABC in the early 1980's. The game was also part of Namco Museum games.
