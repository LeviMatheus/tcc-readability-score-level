The Mozilla Public License (MPL) is a free and open source software license. Version 1.0 was created by Mitchell Baker when she was working as a lawyer at Netscape Communications Corporation and version 1.1 when she was working at the Mozilla Foundation. The MPL is characterized as a mixture of the modified BSD license and GNU General Public License.
The MPL is the license for the Mozilla Application Suite, Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird and other Mozilla software. The MPL was adapted by others as a license for their software; for example Sun Microsystems used the Common Development and Distribution License for OpenSolaris, the open source version of the Solaris 10 operating system, also by Adobe, as the license for its Flex product line.
The MPL license is considered as a weak copyleft specially as the source code copied or changed under the MPL must stay under the MPL.
The MPL license was approved as an Open Source software license by the Open Source Initiative also as a Free Software license by the Free Software Foundation.
