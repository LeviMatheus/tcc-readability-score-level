Theobroma is a genus. There are about 20 species in it. They are small trees, native to the forests of Central and South America. The name translates to "food of the gods".
Their family is given as Sterculiaceae or sometimes as Malvaceae.
Some of these trees have edible seeds. Best known are perhaps the Cacao tree, the source of cocoa and chocolate. Other well-known trees are Cupua√ßu, and Mocambo.
"Theobroma" species are used as food plants by the larvae of some moths of the genus "Endoclita" including "E. chalybeatus", "E. damor", "E. hosei" and "E. sericeus". The larva of another moth, "Hypercompe muzina", feeds exclusively on "Theobroma cacao".
