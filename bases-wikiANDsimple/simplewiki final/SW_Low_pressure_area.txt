A low pressure area, or low for short, is a meteorological word that is used to describe a region where the atmospheric pressure is lowest with relation to the surrounding area. Tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, subtropical cyclones, and subpolar cyclones are called "low-pressure cells" in some English-speaking countries.
