Phobos (or Mars I) is one of Mars' moons. The other is Deimos.
Phobos is the larger of the two moons, and is only 27 kilometers in diameter. This is about as far as a car can travel on the highway in 15 minutes. It is covered with craters, as Earth's moon is.
It is named after the god Phobos in Greek mythology. It's name means "fear".
Phobos is trapped into tidal drag, and its lowering orbit roughly 1.8 meters per century. In about 50 million years, Phobos is likely to collide into Martian atmosphere, or get torn apart and form some ring systems around Mars.
The other moon, Deimos, is the smaller of the two.
Spacecraft.
The Russians have sent at least two space craft to this moon, Phobos 1 and Phobos 2. Both failed or lost contact with Earth, but Phobos 2 managed to take some pictures of the moon.
Features.
There is one large crater on Phobos called Stickney. It is formula_1 the size of the moon itself.
