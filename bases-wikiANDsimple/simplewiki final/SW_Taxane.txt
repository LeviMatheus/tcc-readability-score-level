The taxanes are chemical substances produced by the plants of the genus "Taxus" (yews). They were first made from natural sources, but some have been produced artificially. Taxanes include paclitaxel and docetaxel. Paclitaxel was originally derived from the Pacific yew tree.
Taxanes have been used to make various chemotherapy drugs. Taxanes work mainly by disrupting of the microtubule function. They do this by stabilizing GDP-bound tubulin in the microtubule. Microtubules are essential to cell division, and taxanes therefore stop this - a "frozen mitosis". Thus, taxanes are essentially mitotic inhibitors. In contrast to the taxanes, the vinca alkaloids destroy mitotic spindles. Both, taxanes and vinca alkaloids are therefore named spindle poisons or mitosis poisons, but they act in different ways. Taxanes are also thought to be radiosensitizing.
