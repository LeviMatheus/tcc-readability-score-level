Naturism or nudism (from Latin "nudus" - "naked") is a term used for many movements in society. These movements usually want to propagate that being naked is a good feeling, even in a group of people. Usually, nakedness is seen without any relation to sex. Rather these movements want to propagate common activities in the nude, like bathing naked. Often, they also want to do things naked where this is not strictly necessary, like naked bicycle tours.
