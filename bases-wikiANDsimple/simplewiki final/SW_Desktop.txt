A desktop on a PC (personal computer) is an area the size of the screen, which is used primarily for short cuts to files and folders on the hard drive. Icons (small pictures) are used to represent files/folders, double clicking these icons will open/start the relevant file/folder. The desktop is the area where the start menu resides. A desktop computer also means a computer that sits on a desk, instead of a portable laptop.
