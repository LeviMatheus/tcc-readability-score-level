Klaus Voormann (born April 29, 1942) is a German-born artist and musician, who was a friend of The Beatles. He met them when they played in Hamburg, Germany, where he was going to Art school.
Voormann designed the cover of their "Revolver" album, and later did cover art for "The Beatles Anthology" and some of George Harrison's solo records. He also played bass guitar with Manfred Mann, and on records by John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, and their friend Harry Nilsson.
He also became a record producer, and produced the band Trio, whose biggest hit was "Da Da Da", which was used later in a Volkswagen television commercial.
