In Egyptian mythology, Ma'at, pronounced as *Muʔʕat (Muh-aht), is goddess of law, morality, and justice. Ma'at was seen as being charged with controlling the stars, seasons, and the actions of both people and gods. Her first role in Egyptian mythology was the weighing of words that took place in the underworld, Duat.
Ma'at as a principle.
Ma'at as a principle was at least partially codified into a set of laws, and expressed a ubiquitous concept of right from wrong characterized by concepts of truth and a respect for and adherence to a divine order believed to be set forth at the time of the world's creation.
