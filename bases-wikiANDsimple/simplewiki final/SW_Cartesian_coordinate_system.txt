In mathematics, the Cartesian coordinate system is used to determine each point uniquely in a plane through two numbers, usually called the "x-coordinate" and the "y-coordinate" of the point. To define the coordinates, two perpendicular directed lines (the "x-axis" or abscissa and the "y-axis" or ordinate), are specified, as well as the unit length, which is marked off on the two axes (see Figure 1). Cartesian coordinate systems are also used in space (where three coordinates are used) and in higher dimensions.
Using the Cartesian coordinate system geometric shapes (such as curves) can be described by algebraic equations. Such equations are satisfied by the coordinates of the points lying on the shape. For example, the circle of radius 2 may be described by the equation x² + y² = 4 (see Figure 2).
Cartesian means relating to the French mathematician and philosopher René Descartes (Latin: "Cartesius"), who, among other things, worked to merge algebra and Euclidean geometry. This work was influential in the development of analytic geometry, calculus, and cartography.
The idea of this system was developed in 1637 in two writings by Descartes. In part two of his Discourse on Method Descartes introduces the new idea of specifying the position of a point or object on a surface, using two intersecting axes as measuring guides. In "La Géométrie", he further explores the above-mentioned concepts.
See coordinates (mathematics) for other commonly used coordinate systems such as "polar coordinates" and coordinate systems for usage of the term in advanced mathematics.
