An indulgence, in Roman Catholic theology, means that temporal punishment for sins which have already been forgiven is taken from the sinner.
The indulgence is granted by the church after the sinner has confessed and received absolution.
Indulgences replaced the severe penances of the early church.
That they were sold was the reason why Martin Luther protested against it. This was the starting point for the Protestant Reformation (1517).
