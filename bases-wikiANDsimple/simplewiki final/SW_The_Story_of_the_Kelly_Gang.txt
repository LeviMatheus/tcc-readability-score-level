"The Story of the Kelly Gang" is the world's first feature length movie. This 70 minute movie was made in 1906, 9 years before D.W. Griffith's "The Birth of a Nation" made in 1915. The movie tells the story of the famous Australian bushranger, Ned Kelly (1855-1880). It was written and directed by Charles Tait. The film's reel length is about 4,000 feet (1,200 metres). It was released in Australia on December 26, 1906 and in the UK in January 1908. The film cost about $2,250 to make. It was filmed in Melbourne and nearby suburbs of St Kilda (indoor scenes), Eltham, Greensborough, Heidelberg, Mitcham and Rosanna.
There is only about 10 minutes of film left. In November 2006 the National Film and Sound Archive made a new digital copy of the movie. This has 11 minutes of extra film which was discovered in the United Kingdom. The movie now is 17 minutes long. It has the main scene of the Kelly's fight with the police at Glenrowan (called the Kelly's Last Stand). A copy of the program book has also been found. It has stories from newspaper reports of the capture of the gang, and the story of the movie, in 6 'scenes'. This told the audiences what was happening in the movie. The book and the little bit of film that is left can help people imagine what the whole movie may have been like.
In 2007 "The Story of the Kelly Gang" was added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Register for being the world's first full-length feature movie.
