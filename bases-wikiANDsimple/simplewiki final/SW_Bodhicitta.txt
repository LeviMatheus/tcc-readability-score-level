In Buddhist thought, bodhicitta is the motivation of a bodhisattva. The word "bodhicitta" combines the words for enlightenment "(Bodhi)" and mind "(Citta)". It is sometime translated as "mind of enlightenment".
Bodhicitta is taught to be the intent to become enlightened, not for oneself, but for the benefit of "all" beings.
