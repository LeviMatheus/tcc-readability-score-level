The British Rail Class 165 "Network Turbo" diesel multiple units (DMUs) were built by BREL at York Works from 1990â€“1992.
These units are suburban trains, with an express version appearing later in the form of the Class 166 "Network Express Turbo" units. The Class 165 belongs to the Turbo and the Networker families of trains.
