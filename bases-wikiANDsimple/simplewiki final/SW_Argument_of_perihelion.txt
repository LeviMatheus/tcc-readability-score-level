The Argument of perihelion, also known as argument of periapsis or argument of perifocus (Ï‰) is the orbital element describing the angle of an orbiting body's periapsis (the point of closest approach to the central body), relative to its ascending node (the point where the body crosses the plane of reference from South to North). The angle is measured in the orbital plane and in the direction of motion.
