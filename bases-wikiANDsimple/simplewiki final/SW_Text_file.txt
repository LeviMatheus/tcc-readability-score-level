A text file is a computer file with an extension of.doc.txt, and many others, depending on the software and hardware you choose. They can be opened and edited with Microsoft Word, Wordpad, Notepad, and other text editors. Text files usually contain plain text and not binary data. Whether it be a story, recipe, or even directions to Grandma's house, you can put it in a text file.
Once the author completes the text file, he can then choose to change the properties of it to become read-only, meaning later viewers/downloaders cannot change the original document. This also comes with the option of password protection.
