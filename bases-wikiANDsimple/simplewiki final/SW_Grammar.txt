Grammar refers to the rules about how to speak and write well in a language.
For example, Spanish grammar is different from English grammar. It has different rules. In English, a person may say "I like fast cars", but in Spanish, it is "me gustan los coches r√°pidos." The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean "to me they please the cars fast" Even though this is not good English grammar, it is correct in Spanish. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order.
Grammar is slowly changing. Sentences English speakers find normal today might have seemed strange to people 100 years ago. Some people use grammar that is different from others' when speaking. They might say, "I didn't do nothing" rather than "I didn't do anything." They usually do this because that is what is normal in their family or the area where they live.
Grammar studies noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, conjunction. Grammar studies sentence structure: syntax.
