Lapis lazuli is a metamorphic rock. It is famous for its beautiful blue colour. Its name means "stone of blue", and comes from the word "lazward", from Ancient Persia (now known as Iran). Lapis Lazuli has been used for many things. Its has been made into beads and used in jewellery since Prehistoric times. It can be carved into statuettes (little sculptures). The major use was as a "pigment" (colour) in artists' paint. During Medieval and Renaissance times, Lapis lazuli was ground up into powder, and mixed into paint as the colour for painting the sky and the robe of the Virgin Mary. It can be seen in the fresco paintings of Giotto and the tempera paintings of Fra Angelico.
