The Inca were a civilization (country) and an empire (kingdom) in western South America.
The word Inca can also mean the king of the Inca people.
The Inca are called a "pre-Columbian" empire.
This means that their country was here before Christopher Columbus. They ruled parts of South America around what is now Peru for a little over 100 years, until the Spanish invasion in the 16th century.
The Inca empire or Tawantinsuyo, that in quechua means: "four regions", only lasted for about 100 years as the arrival of the conquering Spaniards in 1532 marked the end of their 'reign'. Their main language was Quechua, but as the Incas were basically made up of many different groups there were probably many different languages also.
Their capital was in the city of Cusco, or Qosqo, in what is now southern Peru.
