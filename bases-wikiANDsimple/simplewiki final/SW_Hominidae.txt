The hominids are members of the biological family Hominidae (the great apes), which includes humans, chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. "Great ape" is a common name rather than a taxonomic label and there are differences in usage. Subtly, it may seem to exclude human beings ("humans and the great apes") or to include them ("humans and non-human great apes"). "Homo sapiens" is not at any especial remove from other members of the biological family, and humans are therefore described here as great apes.
This constitued, the Hominidae includes 4 genera and 5 species. Its nonhuman members are restricted to equatorial Africa, Sumatra and Borneo. Hominid fossils date the Miocene and are known from Asia.
Hominids range in weight from 48 kg to 270 kg. Males are larger than femals. Hominids are the primates, with robust bodies and well-developed forearms. Their pollex and hallux are opposa except in humans, who have lost opposability of the big toe. All digits have flattened nails. No hominid has a tail, and none has ischial callosties. Numerous skeletal differences between hominids and other primates are related to their upright or semi-upright stance.
The classification also includes the ancestors of the currently living species.
