Pichu is the pre-evolved form of Pikachu in the "Pok√©mon" series. It is a small yellow electric mouse, but doesn't have as much power as a Pikachu. Being an electric Pokemon it is good against flying Pokemon such as Spearow and Fearow, but it is not good against rock type Pokemon such as Geodude and Onix.
