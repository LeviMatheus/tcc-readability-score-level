Game Boy was Nintendo's first game console in the Game Boy range. It was Nintendo's first portable console to use game cartridges, so it could play more than one game, and you could take it anywhere. Since 1989 the range has grown to include not only the original, but also many other consoles such as Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP and Game Boy Micro. All of these but the Game Boy Micro can play games made for the Game Boy.
The Game Boy had a green screen that could show four shades of grey or dark green. Like the NES, it had four buttons and a cross-shaped directional control. The console had a single speaker, but could be used with stereo headphones. As many as four Game Boys could be connected together with special wires for games with more than one player.
The idea for the Game Boy came from Gumpei Yokoi, who also made Metroid and the Virtual Boy.
Nintendo made Game & Watch games before the Game Boy and the Game Boy Advance and later the Nintendo DS after the Game Boy.
