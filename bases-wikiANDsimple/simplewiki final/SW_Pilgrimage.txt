A pilgrimage is when people travel to a place of worship that is usually far away. They may have to go to a different city or country. Usually a pilgrimage is done for spiritual or religious reasons. Muslims have to do a pilgrimage to Mecca. This is called Hajj. Other modern-day pilgrimages include the Way of Saint James, and the pilgrimage to Mount Kailash.
