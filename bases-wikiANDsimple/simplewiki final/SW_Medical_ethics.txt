Medical ethics is the set of ethical rules that doctors follow. These ideas tell doctors how they should treat patients.
The earliest set of ethical ideas in medicine was the "Hippocratic oath". (An oath is a special promise.) It was supposed to be written by Hippocrates but probably was not written by him.
