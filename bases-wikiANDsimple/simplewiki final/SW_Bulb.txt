A bulb is the part of some plants, mostly under the dirt, that stores food while the plant is resting from growing (a "storage organ").
Some well-known bulbs people grow to use as food are onions and garlic. Some bulbs grown for the decorative flowers are the lily, tulip, and some irises.
Some plant storage organs that are similar to bulbs, but have different names are, tubers, corms (swollen stems), tuberous roots, and pseudobulbs.
