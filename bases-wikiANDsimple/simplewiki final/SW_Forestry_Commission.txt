The Forestry Commission is a UK Government agency that was set up in 1919.
The commission is responsible for many forests and woodlands in Great Britain. Its job is to protect and expand Britain's forests and woodlands and increase their value to society and the environment.
Some of its forests are pine trees which the commission manages and carefully cuts down trees for wood and paper making. The money from this helps the commission to maintain it other forests which are not farmed but which are used for recreation, by people wanting to visit the countryside, and also to fund some scientific research into the ways to grow trees and to keep them healthy.
The Forestry Commission looks after a lot of the forests in the list of Forests in the United Kingdom
