The Sea of Japan (also called East Sea) is a sea in the western Pacific Ocean. It is between Korea to the west, Russia to the north and Japan to the east and south. There is a conflict in naming the sea. South Korea claim that it is East Sea, and North Korea claim that it is East Korea Sea.
Arguments about the name.
International Hydrographic Organization(IHO) decided to call this sea area "Sea of Japan" in 1929.
Since 1992, South Korea requests the world to use the names "East Sea" or "Sea of Korea" instead of "Sea of Japan".
South Korea argues that this sea area has been called "East Sea" since early times. It is also a common belief that the name "East Sea" was eliminated from the maps of the world in the early 20th century while South Korea was under the rule of Japan.
On the contrary, Japan insists that the name "Sea of Japan" has been used more widely than "East Sea" in Europe and America since the 18th century.
