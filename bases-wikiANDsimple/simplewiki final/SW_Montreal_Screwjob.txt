The Montreal Screwjob is the real-life screwjob of then WWF superstar Brett Hart. The screwjob occurred in a match for the WWF Championship at "Survivor Series" in 1997 in Montreal, Quebec. The screwjob happened when Hart's opponent, Shawn Michaels, applied Hart's own finishing move, the Sharp Shooter and then WWF Referee Earl Hebner called for the bell under Vince McMahon's order even though Hart had not submitted (or tapped-out). As a result, Michaels became the WWF Champion. McMahon was the one who started the plans for the screwjob when Hart announced he was leaving the WWF for the companies then biggest competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and refused to lose the title in front of his fellow Canadians to Michaels. The original, scripted plan was for Hart to win at Survivor Series and surrender the title the next night on "Raw". McMahon felt he didn't need another "Alundra Blayze incident" so he instituted the screwjob.
