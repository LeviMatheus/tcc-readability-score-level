IUPAC is am acronym for the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry. It governs everything to do with chemicals, elements and new discoveries. Every chemical known has a common name and a IUPAC name. This is also true for the Periodic Table of the Elements. Every element's name has been approved by IUPAC. (This does not apply to those elements still given temporary names. These are the most recently discovered elements Uub; Ununbium to Uuo; Ununoctium.)
