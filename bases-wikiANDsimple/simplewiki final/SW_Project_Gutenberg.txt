Project Gutenberg (PG) was founded in 1971. It was founded by Michael S. Hart. The purpose of the Project is to collect in and make available cultural work (like books) using computers. These are generally free and may be used on most of the computers. The project gets its name from Johannes Gutenberg. Johannes Gutenberg lived in the 15th century in Germany. He made the first European printing press.
As the PG continued to grow, in 2000, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, Inc. was created. It is a non-profit organization with main office in Mississippi, United States.
