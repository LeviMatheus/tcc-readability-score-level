The Afrikaans Language Monument (Afrikaans: "Afrikaanse Taalmonument") is the only monument in the world dedicated to a language. It is located on a hill overlooking the Teachers' Training College in Paarl, Western Cape Province, South Africa. Completed in 1975, it was built to celebrate the 100 years birthday of Afrikaans being declared as a different language from Dutch.
Inscriptions.
On a large inscription at the entrance, two quotes from important Afrikaans poets are written.
Dit Is Ons Erns.
The phrase "DIT IS ONS ERNS" ("we are earnest [about this]", or "this is our earnestness") is inscribed on the pathway leading up to the monument.
