A trolleybus (also known as trolley bus, trolley coach, trackless trolley, trackless tram or simply trolley) is a bus, which get its power for the electric engine from a pair of powerlines, which is above the street. Trolleybuses get the power though 2 poles called "trolley poles".
A trolleybus does not have a normal engine which uses oil. So trolleybuses are much clearner and quiter than "normal" buses.
Trolleybues do not use tracks, so they are more flexible than trams.
