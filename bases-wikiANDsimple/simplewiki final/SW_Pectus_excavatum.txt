Pectus excavatum is a medical problem. The sternum (middle of the chest) is pushed into the chest. This makes the chest look sunken in. It is also called a "chest bowl" and a "dent".
Causes.
Doctors do not know why some people have the dent. They think it might be caused by a bad gene from the parent. It is also linked to syndromes (illnesses) that effect other parts of the body.
Numbers.
Pectus excavatum happens in about 1 in every 150 children.
Nuss Procedure.
The Nuss Prodcedure was created by Doctor Nuss from Norfolk in Virginia. A metal bar is put into the chest; the bar holds the chest up.
Suction Cup.
A vacuum bell, also called a suction cup, can be used to fix pectus excavatum. The cup is placed on the chest and all the air is removed, this pulls up the chest.
Ravitch.
The Ravitch technique is from the 1950s. It involves cutting out part of the chest, placing a bar in the chest, and having the bone grow back. Most doctors do not use the Ravitch because it causes much blood loss.
