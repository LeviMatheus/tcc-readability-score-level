Skoll or Saturn XLVII (provisional designation S/2006 S 8) is non-spherical moon of Saturn. Its discovery was announced by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt and Jan Kleyna on June 26, 2006, from observations taken between January 5 and April 30, 2006.
Skoll is about 6 kilometres in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04), and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 17,600,000 km in 869 days, following a highly eccentric and inclined orbit.
It was named in April 2007 after Sk√∂ll, a giant wolf from Norse mythology, son of Fenrisulfr and twin brother of Hati.
