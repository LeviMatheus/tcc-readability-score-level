Eubie Blake (February 7, 1887 - February 12, 1983) was an American pianist and composer. There is some problems about his birth date. He had said that he was born in 1883 during the latter part of his life. However, recently released documents - the 1900 United States census, his World War 1 draftcard, his Social Security registration and his passport registration - all say that he was born in 1887. People saying they were born earlier than they actuall were ("back dating") was common with musicians from that time. Jelly Roll Morton is another well known example of this. Blake also said that he composed his "Charleston Rag" in 1899. If this was true, he would have been 12 years old at the time. There is no evidence he was composing at that age or at that time. People who study Ragtime believe this may be another case of "backdating". Blake was born in Baltimore, Maryland.
