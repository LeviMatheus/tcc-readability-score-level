A weed is a plant that someone thinks is bad, because it is growing in the wrong place. Trees are not often called weeds, only smaller plants.
If someone is farming a plant and it then moves outside the farm, the plant may then be called a weed.
Some plants are very hard to stop once they start growing. These are called invasive weeds.
Weed is also a name for any wild plant, one that people do not use for anything.
