The Danish Centre of Urban History (in Danish, "Dansk Center for Byhistorie") is a research and communication center for the history of Danish cities. The centre was founded in 2001 by The Institute of History and Area Studies at Aarhus University and The Old Town, National Open Air Museum of Urban History and Culture. The Centre has two book series called "Danish Urban Studies" and "Writings on Danish Urban History". These series have books and articles about Danish urban history from medieval ages until today. The centre provides Danish urban history to a wider audience on the internet through a website called The Digital City Gate. This site gives access to databases and presentations of Danish urban history. It mainly focuses on the period from 1600 to 1900.
