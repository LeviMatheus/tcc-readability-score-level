First aid is basic knowledge about injuries (body damage). It is used at accidents to help stop more serious harm from happening to an injured person until he receives medical treatment (help by doctors, nurses or ambulance paramedics). A person does not need a lot of equipment to give first aid. Because of this, it can be done just about anywhere.
Training.
You need very good training to give first aid. Training is given by a very experienced (lots of knowledge) medical person, for example a doctor or a nurse. The level of training needed to be a first aid giver changes from country to country - for example, in the UK you can go on a 1-day course to become a first aid giver for anything, and a 4-day course for emergencies in a place of work.
