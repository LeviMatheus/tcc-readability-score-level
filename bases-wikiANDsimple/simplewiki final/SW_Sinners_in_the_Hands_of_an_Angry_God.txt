Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God is famous sermon that was preached by Jonathan Edwards in 1741. He was an important Calvinist Congregational minister. The sermon is often used in American high schools and college English classes as an example of the Puritan writings.
Edwards taught the sermon many times. The first time was in Northampton, Massachusetts, but it did not get much attention. But on the the second time in Enfield, Connecticut, it made many people weeping, swooning, cry out, and have convulsions from people in his audience.
Deuteronomy 32:35 says, "Their foot shall slide in due time." That verse was the main focus of the beginning of the sermon. As was normal in 18th century New England, the sermon was printed and many copies were made. It has proven to be the main reason of his theology and preaching that was taught by many people in the first Great Awakening.
