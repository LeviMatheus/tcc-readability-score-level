Egon Schiele (12 June 1890 â€“ 31 October 1918) (, approximately SHEE-luh) was an Austrian painter. He has been seen as an expressionist, but also as part of the art nouveau movement. Together with Gustav Klimt and Oskar Kokoschka he was among the most important artists who contributed to Wiener Moderne. The most important collection of Schiele's work is housed in the Leopold Museum, Vienna.
Shiele died of influenza, aged only 28. He fell prey to the pandemic known as Spanish flu, which kliled between 20 and 100 million people.
