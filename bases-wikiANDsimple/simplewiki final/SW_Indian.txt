The word Indian means from or about the country of the modern Republic of India or Bharat. It refers to a person from India. Many different languages are used in India, so there is no one language called "Indian". Some languages of India are Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu, Sanskrit, Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu.
The word Indian is also sometimes used for the people who were in North America, Central America, South America, and the islands of the Caribbean Sea when the Europeans first came there. The Europeans made a mistake and thought they were going to India, so they called the people "Indians".
Other names for these people are American Indians, First Nations, and Native Americans.
