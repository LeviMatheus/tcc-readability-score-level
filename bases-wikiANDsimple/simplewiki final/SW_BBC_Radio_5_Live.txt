BBC Radio 5 Live (formerly BBC Radio Five Live) is the BBC's radio station that gives live BBC News, phone-ins, and sports news. It is the main radio station for sport in the United Kingdom, covering nearly all big sports events in the UK or with British competitors in.
It is transmitted via analogue radio on 693 and 909 kHz AM in the medium wave band. These frequencies belonged to BBC Radio 2 from November 23, 1978 to August 26, 1990. Before that they were used in some regions of the UK by the BBC Home Service and BBC Radio 4. The radio is also available on digital radio in the United Kingdom via DAB, digital satellite, IPTV, Freeview, and is also streamed online. However, because of rights restrictions, coverage of some events (especially live sporting events) is not available online. Also, some of the content available online is only for UK users.
Other websites.
Note that Radio 5 Live operates International and UK feeds. International feeds aren't allowed to cover certain sports events because of local radio rights to those events.
