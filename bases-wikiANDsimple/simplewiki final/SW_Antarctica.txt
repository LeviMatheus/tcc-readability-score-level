Antarctica is a large continent located at the far south of the world. It is larger than Europe. The weather there is extremely cold. About 98% of Antarctica is covered with ice. Very few people live there, except in the small towns of McMurdo and Palmer on the coast. There is a science station at the South Pole where experiments are carried out. These experiments are to do with the weather and outer space exploration. People who want to go to Antarctica usually fly there. However, it is also possible to book tourist cruises to visit the continent. These depart from Ushuaia, which is in southern Argentina.
Antarctica is the only continent with no countries in it. By international treaty, none of the land in Antarctica belongs to any country.
There are very few plants in Antarctica; the only large air-breathing animals are penguins, seals, and whales.
Antarctica is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, but more recently, the seas right around it have together been called the Southern Ocean. The next nearest continent is South America.
In Antarctica, it is always dark during the winter, but in the summer the sun shines 24 hours a day.
There is one volcano in Antarctica. It is named Mount Erebus. Mount Ereubus is very high.
