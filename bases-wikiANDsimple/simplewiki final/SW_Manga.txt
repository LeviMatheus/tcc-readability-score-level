A manga is a Japanese comic book, drawn by a "mangaka" (Japanese for cartoonist: an artist of comics)
Manga is read from right to left, sometimes, though, manga is read from left-to-right fasion for some of the lesser known series. Any manga series from Shonen Jump is usually right-to-left, while most manga from Action Manga is left-to-right.
The word manga can be both singular and plural, and mean both the medium of comics or a single comic. It is a form of art that is used to draw comics and do develop Anime, the motion picture version of the original manga art. It is usually a quite abstract art, with use of speed lines often in the backgrounds, and different colours used to show different moods of the people in the picture. Colour and symbolism is often very important, for example purples and greens are often the colours of the bad guys/girls.
