A Gargoyle is a grotesque statue. It is used to get water away from a building, when it rains. Very often, figures have been made. These figures "spew out" the collected water. Most gargoyles were made a long time ago.
A long time ago people believed that they scared away evil spirits.
There are not very many gargoyles made today. Now, most houses can use gutters to move water. There are not a lot of gargoyles in America, as most of the are in Europe.
