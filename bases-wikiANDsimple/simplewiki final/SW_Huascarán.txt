Huascarán is the highest mountain in Peru, and the fourth-highest mountain in South America. The top of it is 22,205 feet (6,768 meters) high. It is located in the Ancash Region of Peru. Huascarán has turned into a tourist attraction for mountain climbers.
The mountain is all that is left of an ancient volcano. The volcano is now extinct, and has been getting smaller and smaller. As recently as 1970, the Ancash Earthquake caused a big part of the mountain to crumble and fall off. That part of the mountain was all rock and ice, and it killed almost 17,000 people in small towns around the mountain.
