Cosmetics (also called makeup, make up, or make-up) are products used to make the human body look different. Often cosmetics are used to make someone more attractive to one person, or to a culture or sub-culture. In Western culture, women are the main users of cosmetics. Their use by men is less frequent. All cosmetics are temporary. They need to be renewed after a certain time. Cosmetics include lipstick, powders (e.g blush, eyeshadow), and lotions as well as other things.
Cosmetics are also widely used in the world of acting.
