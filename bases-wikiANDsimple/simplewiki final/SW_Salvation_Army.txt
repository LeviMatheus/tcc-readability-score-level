The Salvation Army is a Christian organization. It was founded by William and Catherine Booth in the East End of London, England in 1865. It operates in over 100 countries, today and its members solely devote themselves to helping those in need, like the homeless, the sick, the poor, and others, and teaching Christian morals. It operates things like homeless shelters, thrift stores, orphanages, help centers, fund-raisers, and a brass band, all which relies on donations of money from people. It was called the Christian Mission to start with, but in 1878, it was renamed The Salvation Army.
