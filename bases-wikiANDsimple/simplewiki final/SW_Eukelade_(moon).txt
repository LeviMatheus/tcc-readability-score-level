Eukelade or, is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2003, and got the designation.
Eukelade is about 4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 23,484,000 km in 735.200 days, at an inclination of 164° to the ecliptic (165° to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.2829.
It was named in March 2005 after Eukelade, described by some Greek writers as one of the Muses, and thus a daughter of Zeus (Jupiter).
Eukelade belongs to the Carme group, made up of non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance ranging between 23,000,000 and 24,000,000 km and at an inclination of about 165°.
