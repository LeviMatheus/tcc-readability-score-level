Indigo is a dye made from the Indigo plant, used to dye cloth. It is also the sixth color of the rainbow, a shade lying between blue and violet. The color shown at right, "electric indigo", is the closest approximation possible on a computer of the spectrum indigo color of the indigo color band in the rainbow.
Indigo is neither an additive primary color nor a subtractive primary one. Isaac Newton named and defined it when he divided up the optical spectrum (which is a continuum of frequencies). He specifically named seven colors primarily to match the seven notes of a Western musical scale, because he believed sound and light were physically similar. He also named them to link colors with the (known) planets, days of the week, and other lists that had seven items.
The association of India with indigo is reflected in the Greek word for the dye, which was indikon. The Romans used the term "indicum", which passed into Italian dialect and eventually into English as the word indigo.
Indigo dye is used to dye denim cloth, which is used to make what are called blue jeans (they should really be called "indigo jeans").
