Lake Superior is a lake in Canada and the United States.
The Ojibwe Native Americans call it Gitchigume. Lake Superior is in between Ontario and Minnesota to the north and Wisconsin and Michigan in the south, and is the largest of North America's Great Lakes. It is the world's second largest lake, and the world's largest freshwater lake (by area).
