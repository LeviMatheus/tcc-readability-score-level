Monounsaturated fats are found in food items, more particularly natural foods like nuts and avocados. They are the main component in olive oil (oleic acid).
In general, these fats are considered to be healthier as compared to the others. They have the same amount of energy, but they reduce blood cholesterol levels. This reduces the risk to the heart.
