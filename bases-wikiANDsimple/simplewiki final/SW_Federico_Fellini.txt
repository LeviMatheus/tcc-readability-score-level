Federico Fellini (born in Rimini, January 20, 1920, died in Rome, October 31, 1993) was a famous Italian movie-maker and director. Fellini's movies combine memory, dream, and fantasy.
The first movie Fellini directed was "Lo Sceicco Bianco" (1951), with Alberto Sordi, written by Michelangelo Antonioni and Ennio Flaiano. In making this movie Fellini met Nino Rota, the musician that would follow him for the successful rest of his career.
Fellini's wife, actress Giulietta Masina (married in 1943) was often in his movies. Other actors Fellini often worked with include Marcello Mastroianni, Alberto Sordi, and Anita Ekberg.
Apart from making movies he also wrote scripts for radio shows, for movies (mainly for Rossellini) and wrote comic gags for well known actors like Aldo Fabrizi.
Fellini also produced several drawings (mostly pencil on paper), often humoristic portraits.
His first success was in drawing advertising pictures for movies.

The shop was named (in English) "The Funny Face Shop", and contained works from Fellini and De Seta, Verdini, Camerini, Scarpelli, Majorana, Guasta, Giobbe, Attalo, Migneco (all writers, directors or otherwise intellectuals working for Italian cinema).
