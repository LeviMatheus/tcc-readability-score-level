Richard 'Ricky' Spragia (born May 26, 1956) is a former Scottish footballer who currently manages Sunderland.
He was appointed in late December 2008 after the previous manager Roy Keane walked out after a run of bad results which had left Sunderland towards the foot of the table. In his first four games as caretaker manager he managed two wins and a draw and this was enough to get him the unanimous vote of the board and was appointed with a permanent contract on 27 December 2008.
