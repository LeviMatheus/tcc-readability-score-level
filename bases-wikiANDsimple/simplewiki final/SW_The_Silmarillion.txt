"The Silmarillion" is a book written by J. R. R. Tolkien. It was first published posthumously in 1977, edited by his son Christopher Tolkien. "The Silmarillion" is set in Tolkien's world Middle-earth, and is about its early history before "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings".
The name "Silmarillion" can mean the published book (as in "The Silmarillion"), but it can also mean all the stories from the First Age of Middle-earth (the "Quenta Silmarillion").
