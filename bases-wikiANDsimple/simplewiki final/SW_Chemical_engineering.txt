Chemical Engineering is a type of engineering that was started in the early 20th century. Chemical engineering uses physics (the science of moving objects and forces), chemistry (the science of substances), and mathematics. There are many different types of jobs for people with degrees in chemical engineering.
Some new topics in chemical engineering include environmental sanitation at factories (making certain nature is not hurt by the factories), types of energy other than those from gas or oil) and biological engineering.
