"All-Star Cheer Squad" is an upcoming rhythm video game in development by Gorilla Systems Corp with help from THQ. It is one of several Wii games to use the Wii Balance Board. It is about cheerleading.
The game will be THQâ€™s "first original property created specifically for girls".
Overview.
The game will follow a year in the life of a cheerleader as they learn new cheers, participate in practices and create their own routines to make the squad and eventually become captain.
On the Wii, the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, along with the Balance Board can be used to perform cheer and dance moves. Cheerleading choreographer Tony G of "Bring It On" fame will be acting as chief consultant to the game.
