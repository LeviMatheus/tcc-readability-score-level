The Western Isles are sometimesw calles "Outer Hebrides", (officially known by the Gaelic name, "Na h-Eileanan Siar") comprise an island chain off the west coast of Scotland.
"na h-Eileanan an Iar" in Scottish Gaelic is also the name of the parliamentary constituency.
They form part of the Hebrides, separated from the Scottish mainland and from the Inner Hebrides by the stormy waters of the Minch, the Little Minch and the Sea of the Hebrides. Formerly the dominant language of the Islands, Scottish Gaelic remains widely spoken even though it has now been largely supplanted by English in some parts.

Historical footnote: Many websites of the Outer Hebrides derive content from the Eolas Virtual Hebrides, website. This was once the largest rural website in the world. Eolas went bankrupt in 2000 and the Eolas TV company became. The web design team became and the content has largely found a home on GlobalGuide.Org.
