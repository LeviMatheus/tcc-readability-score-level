With help from by the Army of Poland, the Polish people tried to stop Russia controlling the biggest city in Poland. It started on April 17, 1794, which was soon after Tadeusz Kościuszko's victory at an important battle.
Although the Russian army had lots more poeple and better weapons, and killed lots of Polish people, Russian soldiers started to lose a lot of land and suffered from lots of deaths.
The Polish people had been preparing to fight in the uprising since the spring of 1793. They managed to become very poular: they formed an army with lots of volunteers, who were led by Jan Kiliński, who was a good shoemaker. Apart from this army, the most famous group to take part in the giving the Polish people freedom contained Poles who had been forced to join the Russian army in the past. A person who watched fighting was Jan Piotr Norblin, who was born in France and drew pictures of the uprising.
