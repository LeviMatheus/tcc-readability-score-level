A Sepsis is a very dangerous disease. It occurs when an infection goes wrong. The pathogen was at some point able to get into the blood or tissues. The term sepsis is frequently used to refer to septicemia (blood poisoning). Septicemia is only one type of sepsis. Bacteremia specifically refers to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream (viremia and fungemia are the terms used for viruses and fungi).
Symptoms.
Common symptoms of sepsis are inflammations all over the body. This is often combined with high fever. Today, people believe, these symptoms are caused by the immune system trying to fight the disease. Because of the strong reactions, organs can be damaged in the process.
Cause of death.
In the United States, sepsis is the leading cause of death for ICU patients which do not have heart problems. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows it is the tenth most common cause of death overall. Older people, those with a weak immune system and those with a stong illness suffer from sepis more often. It is also more dangerous to them. It occurs in 1%-2% of all hospitalizations and accounts for as much as 25% of intensive care unit (ICU) bed utilization. It is a major cause of death in intensive care units worldwide, with mortality rates that range from 20% for sepsis to 40% for "severe sepsis" to over 60% for "septic shock".
More severe forms.
Severe sepsis and septic shock are more severe forms of sepis. With severe sepsis, one or more organs fail to work. Septic shock is when sepis is combined with very low blood pressure
Treatment.
Today, the bacterial forms of sepsis can be treated with antibiotics. In addition, the bad fluids (blood) have to be replaced. It might also necessary to functionally replace the organs that failed.
About half the people affected die from the condition. Rapid access to treatment will increase the chances of survival, in most cases.
