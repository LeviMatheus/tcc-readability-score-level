The Piccadilly Line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is a deep-level line running from the north-east to the west of London. It runs from Cockfosters station to Heathrow Airport station or Uxbridge station.
Trains.
Like most London Underground lines, the Piccadilly Line is run by one type of train only. The Piccadilly Line is run by the 1973 tube stock, in the London Underground colours of blue, white and red. Seventy-six trains out of all together 88 are needed to run the line's peak service, and one unit was badly damaged by the terrorist attack of 7 July 2005. While the trains were recently renovated, it is going to be replaced within the next ten years.
The line was run by 1959 stock, 1956 stock, 1938 stock, standard tube stock and 1906 gate stock, before they were replaced by th 1973 stock.
The line has 2 depots, one at Northfields and one between Oakwood and Cockfosters. There are sidings at South Harrow, Arnos Grove, Rayners Lane, Down Street, Wood Green, Hyde Park Corner, Acton Town and Uxbridge.
Signalling.
The signals of the line are controlled from the control centre at Earl's Court, which is also used by the District Line. There are plans to set up new signals because the existing signals are too old. This work is planned for 2014.
Services.
"tph " means trains per hour, for example 3tph means that there is a train every 20 minutes).
Half of the Uxbridge trains turn back at Rayners Lane - a 10-minute service runs between Acton and Rayners Lane, with a 20-minute service to Uxbridge (this part is also used by the Metropolitan line).
Other services operate at times, especially at the start and towards the end of the traffic day.
