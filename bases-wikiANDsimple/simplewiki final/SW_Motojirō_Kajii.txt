was a Japanese author of the Sh≈çwa period. He wrote several famous poetic short stories such as "The Lemon", "Winter Days"," and "Under the Cherry Trees".
He died at young age and wrote few works, but his stories have become influential in Japanese culture. For example, many high school students imitate the protagonist of his short story "Lemon", leaving a lemon in a department store. And his first line is usually said by Japanese people about the cherry-blossoms-watching custom of hanami.
