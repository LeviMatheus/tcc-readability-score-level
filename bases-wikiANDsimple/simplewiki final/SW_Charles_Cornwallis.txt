Lord Charles Cornwallis (1738 December 31 - 1805 October 5) was a British general and colonial governor. He is best known for leading the British forces in the American Revolution.
Cornwallis moved to the 13 colonies in North America in 1776 to try to control the rebelling colonies. He fought at the Battle of Princeton. George Washington led the Americans in that battle. Later, Cornwallis led British forces through North Carolina and South Carolina, where he fought against American forces under Nathanael Greene. In October of 1781, Cornwallis's forces surrendered to George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown, ending the American Revolution.
