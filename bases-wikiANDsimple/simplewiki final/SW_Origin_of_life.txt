There are many theories on Origin of life because we can't define what life is still and because we haven't made any kind of life in laboratory.
We don't know whether metabolism or genetics comes earlier. The main hypothesis which supports genetics first is RNA world hypothesis, and the one which supports metabolism first is Protein world hypothesis.
RNA world hypothesis.
In this hypothesis, RNA is said to work both as enzyme and as container of gene. After that, DNA takes after its rule as container of gene.
There are some evidences which supports this idea.
There are also some reasons because of which some deny this idea.
Protein world hypothesis.
This idea insists that protein worked as enzyme first, and after that DNA and RNA began to work as container of gene.
This idea also has some evidences which supports this.
In recent years, a new variation of this idea, GADV hypothesis, was presented.
