"Stand Up For Love" was the first single from Destiny's Child's greatest hits album, "1's". Released in 2005, the single became Destiny's Child's first single to fail to chart in the United States. The song was the final Destiny's Child single, although another new song from the album, "Check on It" (a solo Beyonc√© Knowles song) was released.
