Jesus with erection is a picture made and students at the University of Oregon. It caused many debates in the United States in 2006.
The picture shows a naked Jesus on the Cross with an erection. The students have made eleven more pictures of Jesus. One of the picture is called "Resurrection"; on the picture is Jesus who is kissing a man; both are naked and both have erections.
Context.
The same year, Danish journalists have published pictures of Mohammed, the most important prophet of Islam. Muslims in the whole world have criticized the pictures of Mohammed, because they are against that anybody make pictures of Mohammed. In the western world (Europe and North America especially), people criticized that the Muslim protests were very violent; they said that Muslims have to understand that in western countries, there is freedom of expression.
The students of Oregon University explained that they made the pictures of Jesus because they want to show how religious people feel when others make (ugly) pictures of their prophet. The students said that the pictures should cause dialogue and a better understanding between Muslims and Christians.
Reactions.
Many people were against the picture made by the students and said that the government should not finance any more the student newspaper. The president of the Catholic League, William Donohue, said that the president of the Oregon University, Dave Frohnmayer, is partially responsible for the pictures.
The Catholic leader said that the "Jesus with erection" was one of the worst attacks on Christianity he had ever seen. Other conservatives said that the University's President David B. Frohnmayer should not work in the University. On the other side, the Oregon Daily Emerald and the Oregon Commentator, two University founded newspapers, publicly defended the students' right to free speech and Frohnmayer's decision to uphold the controversial student newspaper, citing the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States.
