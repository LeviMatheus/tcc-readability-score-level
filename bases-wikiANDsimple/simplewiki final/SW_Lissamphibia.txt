The subclass Lissamphibia includes all recent amphibians.
Extant amphibians fall into one of three orders - the "Anura" (frogs, including toads), the Caudata or Urodela (salamanders, including newts), and the "Gymnophiona" or Apoda (the limbless caecilians). Although the ancestry of each group is controversial, all share certain common characteristics, which indicates they evolved from a common ancestor and so form a clade.
