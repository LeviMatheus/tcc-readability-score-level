Wind shear is a difference in wind speed and/or direction over a fairly short distance in the atmosphere. Wind shear can be divided into two different types; horiztontal and vertical wind shear.
Sailing.
In sailing, wind shear affects sailboats by presenting a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. Sailmakers may introduce sail twist in the design of the sail, where the head of the sail is set at a different angle of attack from the foot of the sail in order to change the lift distribution with height.
Effects on thunderstorms and severe weather.
Severe thunderstorms, which can spawn tornadoes and hailstorms, require wind shear to organize the storm in such a way as to maintain the thunderstorm for a longer period of time by separating the storm's inflow from its rain-cooled outflow.
