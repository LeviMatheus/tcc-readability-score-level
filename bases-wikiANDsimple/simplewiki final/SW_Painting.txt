Painting is using colours to make art. It is also the word for a painted work of art. Many kinds of paints are used to create art. They include watercolors, acrylics and oils. Other artists like working with pencil or chalk.
Famous paintings are often kept in art galleries, like the National Gallery in London and the Louvre (Paris) where one of the most famous paintings in the world hangs, The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo DaVinci. People do not have to go to a famous gallery to view art. There are private art galleries in many cities around the world.
There is a basic difference between drawing and painting. In drawing, single layer constitues entire image. In painting a layer over other is painted to get the final image. As a result, most of the times the image will not be clear until it gets to final stage.
There are 3 basic stages in painting.
In divide stage, the canvas is divided into a few major areas (depending on the image you paint) and background for those areas are plotted.
In layer stage, a layer over other layer is plotted to get the desired shape in each area. By end of this stage, all objects in the image will be clearly identifible.
The touchup stage needs extra effort. This stage is to provide extra look to the image like precise bordering, merging layers and other visual effects.
