Whaling is the practice of hunting whales on the ocean. Whaling happened the most in the 1800s. Whales were hunted for their meat and for their blubber. When a whale was spotted, a hunt would begin.
Whalers would jump into a small boat and follow the whale. Once they were close to it, they would throw a harpoon that was attached to a very long rope into the whale. The end of this harpoon was not at all like a spear. It had a switch blade on the end that would stay in the whale's skin. Once the harpoon was in the whale, the whale would start swimming as fast as it could. The whale might swim day and night with no stop for several days. Eventually, the whale would stop. The whalers would then kill the whale with one last harpoon. Now, some whalers use a harpoon like before, but the harpoon has a grenade inside. This a very cruel way of killing whales as it hurts them a lot. The whale would then have blood coming out of its blowhole. This meant the whale would die shortly. When the animal died, the whalers would haul the whale onto the ship, skin it, then boil the blubber for the oil.
Now, many countries have agreed not to hunt whales, because otherwise all the whales might die. They signed a treaty a piece agreeing on this Norway and Japan still hunt whales.Russia is also practising whaling but not in such a huge way like for example Japan.
