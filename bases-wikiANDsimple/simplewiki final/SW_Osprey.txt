About it.
The osprey weighs 1.4–2 kg (3.0–4.4 lb) and 52–60 cm (20–24 in) long with a 150–180 cm (5–6 ft) wing (tip to tip). The back of the bird are brown and the belly are white. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, go from the sides of the neck. The eyes are golden to brown, and the "nictitating membrane" (the second eye lip) is pale blue. The "bill" (the mouth of a bird) is black and the feet are white with black talons (nails of a bird). The osprey has a short tail and long, narrow wings with four long, finger-like feathers, and a shorter fifth feather, give the bird a very sharp look.
Both sex are likely similar, but the adult male has thiner body and narrower wings. The breast band of the male is also lighter than that of the female, sometimes there even hasn't one, and the "underwing coverts" (the lover side of the wing) of the male are more pale.
In flight, the osprey bend its wings like an arch, giving it a gull-like look.
