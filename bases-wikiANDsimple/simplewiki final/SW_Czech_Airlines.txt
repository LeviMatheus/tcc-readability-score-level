Czech Airlines was formed as Czechoslovak State Airlines on 6 October 1923. This was when the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic were one country.
The company started flying "domestically" (only inside Czechoslovakia) in 1924. In 1930 They made their first foreign flight.
CSA stopped flying between 1938 and 1945 when the country was occupied by Germany.
When Czechoslovakia split into two countries all of the Czechoslovak State Airlines stayed in the Czech Republic and became Czech Airlines. That is why Czech Airline's logo says CSA: Czech Airlines
