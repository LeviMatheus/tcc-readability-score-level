13 Egeria is a big Main belt asteroid.
It was found by A. de Gasparis on November 2, 1850, and was named by Urbain J. J. Le Verrier, whose computations led to the discovery of Neptune. Egeria was a goddess (other sources say a nymph) of Aricia, in Italy, and the wife of Numa Pompilius, second king of Rome.
Egeria occulted a star on January 8, 1992. The former's disc was found to be quite round (217Ã—196 km).
