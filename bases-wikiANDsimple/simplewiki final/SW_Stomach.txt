The stomach is part of the digestive system. The stomach is a big sack between the esophagus and the small intestines. The stomach keeps food after we eat it. Food we eat is mixed in the stomach. Then the stomach gives the food to the small intestine where most of the nutrition from the food is taken up. One reason the stomach is a big sack is to hold all the food we eat at a meal. Then it can slowly give the food to the small intestine.
The stomach has a lot of acid in it. The cells of the stomach make acid. This protects us from bacteria in the food we eat. It kills the bacteria. But the acid in the stomach can cause problems. It can make peptic ulcer disease worse. It can also cause gastroesophageal reflux (or heartburn.) This is pain in the chest when acid from the stomach "refluxes" (goes back into) the esophagus.
When food goes back up your esophagus and then out of your mouth, this is called vomiting. Vomiting can be a symptom of disease.
The stomachs of other animals work differently than human stomachs. Some animals are very different. Cows, for example, have a stomach with multiple compartments.
Other words for "stomach" which are just used in speaking are "belly" and "tummy".
the stomach is very important, it is the 2nd stage (entering mouth is first) in the digestive process
