The order Lepidoptera is the second biggest order in the class Insecta. It includes the butterflies, moths and skippers. Members of the order are referred to as lepidopterans. A person who collects or studies this order is referred to as a Lepidopterist. This order has more than 180,000 species in 128 families and 47 superfamilies. Only the order Coleoptera (the beetles) has more species. The name is derived from Ancient Greek λεπίδος (scale) and πτερόν (wing).
Characteristics of Lepidoptera.
Lepidopterans undergo complete metamorphosis. They have a four-stage life cycle of egg - larva / caterpillar - pupa -imago/adult.
The larvae have a toughened (sclerotized) head capsule, chewing mouthparts, and a soft body, that may have hair-like or other projections, 3 pairs of true legs, and additional prolegs (up to 5 pairs). They can be confused with the larvae of sawflies. Lepidopteran larvae can be differentiated by the presence of crochets on the prolegs which are absent in the Symphyta (sawflies). Most caterpillars are herbivores, but a few are carnivores (some eat ants or other caterpillars) and detritivores.
Adults have two pairs of membranous wings covered, usually completely, by minute scales. In some species, wings are reduced or absent (often in the female but not the male). Antennae are prominent. In moths, males frequently have more feathery antennae than females, for detecting the female pheromones at a distance.
Adult mouth parts, called a proboscis, are adapted for sucking nectar. Some species have reduced mouthparts (some species do not feed as adults), and others have them modified to pierce and suck blood or fruit juices (some Noctuids).
