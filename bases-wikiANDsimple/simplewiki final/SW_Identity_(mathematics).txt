An equality in mathematical sense is only true under more particular conditions. For this, the symbol â‰¡ is sometimes used. (However, this can lead to misunderstandings since the same symbol can also be used for a congruence relation.)
Identity relation.
A common example of the first meaning is the trigonometric identity
which is true for all real values of formula_5 (since the real numbers formula_6 are the domain of sin and cos), as opposed to
which is true only for values of formula_5 in a subset of the domain.
Identity element.
The concepts of "additive identity" and "multiplicative identity" are central to the Peano axioms.
The number 0 is the "additive identity" for integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For the real numbers, for all formula_9
Similarly, The number 1 is the "multiplicative identity" for integers, real numbers, and complex numbers. For the real numbers, for all formula_9
Identity function.
A common example of an identity function is the identity permutation, which sends each element of the set formula_17 to itself.
Comparison.
These meanings are not mutually exclusive; for instance, the identity permutation is the identity element in the set of permutations of formula_17 under composition.
