Fernando António Nogueira Pessoa (Lisbon, 13 June 1888 - Lisbon, 30 November 1935) more known as Fernando Pessoa, was a Portuguese poet and writer.
Pessoa is considered one of the greatest Portuguese poets of always, to the height of Luís Vaz de Camões; his works reflect the infuence of the classic tradition and the French symbolism, his poetry comes from the saudosism. It is famous for to have written under 73 different names; each of these persons has its own presumed biography, physical qualities, relationship to the others, poetic voice, and perspective, and in part it reflects Pessoa's conviction that there does not exist one integrated personality. His work has been influenced also by the English language, learned in South Africa, where Pessoa passed great part of his youth.
He has died for problems of hepatitis at 47 year of his life, in the same city where he had been born; his last phrase was in English: "I know not what tomorrow will bring...".
Among Pessoa's collection that include poems in English, there are "Sonnets" (1918), "English Poems" (1922), and "Mensagem" (1934).
