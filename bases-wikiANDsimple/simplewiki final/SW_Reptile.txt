Reptiles are a group of vertebrate animals. They form the class "Reptilia". All reptile species are cold blooded, and have scaly skin, lay eggs, and crawl on their belly. Some have legs, but snakes do not. Dinosaurs were also reptiles, but they are extinct now. The name "reptile" stems from Latin language and means "one who creeps", a creeper.
