Historische Zeitschrift, founded in 1859 by Heinrich von Sybel is considered to be the first and for a time the foremost historical journal. The creation of this journal inspired Gabriel Monod to found the French "Revue historique" in 1876. In 1886 the "English Historical Review" was founded and in 1895 the "American Historical Review" was founded.
