Toplessness (or being topless) is usually applied to women, who do not wear any clothing above the waist. That way their breasts are visible. Because the female breast is often seen associated with sexuality, many countries make a difference between men and women is such a state. This is because the male torso does not have such a connotation.
In many non-Western cultures, it is usual that women are topless.
