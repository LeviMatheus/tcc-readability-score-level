The Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon Lorentz formulated it. Lorentz's law defines force that acts on moving charged particles in an electricmagnetic field. Force consists of magnetic force and electric force.
If the charge is positive, the direction of the electric force equal to direction of electric field.
The direction of the magnetic force is given by the right hand rule.
If charged particle move with velocity v in an electic field E and a magnetic field B
Using this law, J.J. Thomson measured mass-to-charge ratio.
