"Some Like It Hot" is a 1959 comedy movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Jack Lemmon, and directed by Billy Wilder. It is seen by some as a remake of a German movie from 1951, called "Fanfaren der Liebe". (Michael Logan wrote the story for this version as well as the 1959 movie.)
"Some Like It Hot" has been remade for the stage twice (in 1972 and 2002).
The movie was ranked at Number One on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Laughs list and fourteen on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.
