Phi (uppercase/lowercase Φ φ), is the letter of the Greek alphabet, used to represent the "ph" sound in Ancient. This sound became the same as "f" around 300 BC, and in Modern Greek the letter denotes the "f" sound. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 500. Letters that came from it include the Roman F and Cyrillic Ф. In English, φ is pronounced like "f" but translitterated (re-written) as "ph" in words which originate in Ancient Greek. In those words which originate in Modern Greek, such as feta cheese, φ is translitterated as "f".
