Charles Milles Manson was the leader of a cult of people who murdered other people. This was in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
He was born on November 12, 1934. He is an American.
His cult was known as "The Family". The members were young men and women. He made them believe his end of the world vision. Even now, he controls some of the ex-members.
He planned and ordered the Family to commit several brutal murders. Most known is the murder by his followers on August 8, 1969 of movie actress Sharon Tate. She was expecting a baby, already seven/eight months. The same night they also murdered Steven Parent, a friend of the groundskeeper at the house; Jay Sebring, a hair stylist; Abigail Folger, an heiress and social worker; and Wojciech Frykowski; a Polish writer and actor.
The next night, Manson and some of his followers murdered Leno La Bianca, a grocery store owner and his wife Rosemary. Manson and his followers were arrested, for stealing cars, but soon they found out they were the ones who committed the murders.
Manson is now in jail for life in California. He and four Family members were sentenced to death, but the death penalty was abolished in California shortly after that. Because of his violent and crazy behavior, the chance is small that he will ever be free from prison.
