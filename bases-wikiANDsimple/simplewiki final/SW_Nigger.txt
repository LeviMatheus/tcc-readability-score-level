Nigger is a racist word to describe people of African descent. Using the word can cause hatred.
The word came from a slang pronunciation of "negro", which is the word for the color black in both Spanish and Latin. It can be found in the works of such writers of the past as Joseph Conrad, Mark Twain, and Charles Dickens, but it is now thought to be an offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English.
The word, or a variation of it, such a "nigga" or "nizzle", is sometimes also used by people of African origin themselves as a friendly term amongst their own communities. But it is usually still seen as extremely offensive if used by anyone else.
