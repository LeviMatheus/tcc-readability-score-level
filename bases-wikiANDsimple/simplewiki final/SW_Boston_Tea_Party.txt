The Boston Tea Party was a violent protest by American colonists against King George III's rule in America. It happened on December 16, 1773.
The British government had been putting taxes on almost everything that Americans wanted to buy, including tea. The Americans had no one to speak for them in the British government. They were mad that they were being taxed by the government but had no part in how the government was run. They did not think it was right to pay taxes when they did not have a representative in the government ("No taxation without representation!"). Also merchants selling their goods would lose their profit because of the taxes.
To show how angry they were, a group of people named the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Native Americans and went onto ships in the Boston harbor. They took boxes of tea and dumped them into the water. This made the British government very angry. The British government made even harder laws for the people of the Massachusetts colony. One of these laws was The Intolerable Acts which said that Boston harbor was closed until the colonists paid back all the tea they lost. The Boston Tea Party was one of the main things that started the American Revolutionary War.
