An ethnic group is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some way. They may all have the same ancestors, speak the same language, or have the same religion.
Sometimes almost all of the people in one country are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.
