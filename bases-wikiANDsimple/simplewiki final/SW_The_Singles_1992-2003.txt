"The Singles 1992-2003" is a greatest hits album by the American alternative rock band No Doubt. It was released on November 25, 2003 (the same day as "Boom Box", a box set album by No Doubt.) The album contained all of the singles the band had released at the time, except for "Squeal" and "Doghouse" (two singles from their album "The Beacon Street Collection" that never became popular.) However, it also included two songs that were not singles: "Trapped in a Box" from their first album "No Doubt", and a cover version of the song "It's My Life" by Talk Talk.
