The A-Level (short for Advanced Level) is a General Certificate of Education set of exams taken in the United Kingdom. They are usually taken during the end of secondary school. In the UK, they are usually taken two years after the students have completed GCSE or IGCSE exams. A-Levels are usually split into six parts, each with its own exam. Most people study three A-Levels, and one AS-Level. An AS-Level is the first half of an A-Level. An AS-Level can be studied on its own, but to get an A-Level the second half must also be learnt.
The examination results of the A-Levels determines if a student is good enough to go to a university or college. Most universities require students who want to attend the university to pass three A-Levels.
