Robert Indiana (born as Robert Clark in New Castle, Indiana on September 13, 1928) is an American artist. He is known for being a part of the pop art movement.
Indiana moved to New York City in 1954 and joined the pop art movement. Indiana's work often has bold, simple, iconic images, especially numbers and short words like "EAT", "HUG", and "LOVE". His sculpture in the lobby of Taipei 101, called "1-0" (2002, aluminum), uses multicolored numbers.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Indiana made a series of "Peace Paintings", which were shown in New York in 2004.
LOVE.
Indiana's best known image is the word "love" in upper-case letters, arranged in a square with a tilted letter "O". This image was first created for a Christmas card for the Museum of Modern Art in 1964. It was put on an eight-cent US Postal Service postage stamp in 1973, the first of their regular series of "love stamps."
An Indiana sculpture showing the Hebrew word for love "(ahava)" is displayed at The Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Israel.
