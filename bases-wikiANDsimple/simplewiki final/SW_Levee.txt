A levee, lev√©e (from the feminine past participle of the French verb "lever", "to raise"), floodbank or stopbank is a natural or artificial slope or wall, usually earthen and often parallels the course of a river. Linguists agree that the term "levee" came into English use in New Orleans circa 1672. It is known in Europe as a dike.
