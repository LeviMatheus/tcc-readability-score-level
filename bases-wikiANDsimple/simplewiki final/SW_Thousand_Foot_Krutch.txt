Thousand Foot Krutch are a hard rock band who formed in 1997.
They have released a number of albums, the latest being The Flame in All of Us
While TFK had rap influences, obvious with trevors vocals in earlier TFK albums, the two most recent ones have moved away from that, and used a more rock based sound.
While "The Last Song" from the band's latest album, has been thought by some to be an outro from the band, TFK still continues touring, and Trevor has said that they were very tired and it's only a sarcastic "Here it all is: love it or hate it".
Touring.
The band is known for a lot of touring. They usually do 200 concerts in a year.
Spring 2008 (march to may) is when TFK went on the comatose Tour (see Concert) and performed in over 30 cities. They have toured with bands such as skillet.
About the band.
The name thousand foot krutch came from the belief that God is a crutch you can lean on, even if your problems pile thousand feet high. What they mean is, you can ask God for help even if you have very serious or many problems in your life.
They have gone through certain line-up changes. For example, steve austine has not always been a part of this, and christian harvey was their original drummer.
