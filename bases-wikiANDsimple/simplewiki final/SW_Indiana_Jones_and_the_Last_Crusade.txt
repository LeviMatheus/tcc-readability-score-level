Plot.
The movie begins with a young Indiana Jones many years ago. He finds a rare artifact that he thinks belongs to a museum, but some men take it from him. Many years later, Jones is on a boat and yells, "This piece belongs into a museum!" the same thing he said before. This time he manages to get the piece and run away before the other men can take it back.
At Marshall College, where he works, someone tells him that the Nazis are after the Holy Grail.
He and Elsa go into the library, where they find a secret passage underground. They find a tablet, which is an important part of the puzzle. While they are there, some men who want to protect the Grail set the water on fire to try to kill them.
