High-definition television (HDTV) is a new television broadcasting system which uses a higher resolution than a normal television. With HDTV we can watch television in higher quality than old television, giving a more vivid and clear screen.
Most HDTV systems use digital signals. And HDTV has a 16:9 aspect ratio. This is different than SDTV (standard-definition television) which uses analog signals and a 4:3 aspect ratio.
HDTV picture resolution is at least twice that of SDTV, so it can present a more vivid screen than analog television or DVD. HDTV can control resolution efficiently.
