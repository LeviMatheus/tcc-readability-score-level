Fantasy is a genre of fiction (make believe) that shows some form of magic, or supernatural force.
Often fantasy also means that the story takes place in another world different from our own (e.g. Middle-earth). Although the word fantasy is most often applied to low-tech worlds, it also can depict highly technized worlds, overlapping with science fiction (e.g. Star Wars). Or it is used for historical fiction, if it is magical in some way.
