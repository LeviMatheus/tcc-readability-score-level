"I Am..." - is the third solo studio album by American R&B singer Beyonc√© Knowles
Background.
Knowles worked on the album for close to one year, longer than she had spent on her previous solo albums and records with former group Destiny's Child. She revealed that she has co-written and co-produced over 70 songs.
In a statement released on Knowles official website, she stated: "I am in a different place right now and I wanted people to see the many sides of me. The music is upbeat for the dance, fun side and it is reflective, passionate and serious for the personal side. I have taken risks here. I am not afraid and my music will explain it all. There is no label or tag on my sound. It's me and I am so excited to share it with the world on November 18."
