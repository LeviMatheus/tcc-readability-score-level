The Antilopine Kangaroo ("Macropus antilopinus"), also called the Antilopine Wallaroo or the Antilopine Wallaby'", is an animal, a large macropod found only in the tropical areas of northern Australia. They can be found in Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland, the "Top End" of the Northern Territory, and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. They are found in groups feeding on the open grass lands.. Antilopine kangaroos are often found in groups of all male, or all female.
The male is a red colour and females are grey. The males can get as big as 70 kg, but the females are usually around 30 kg. It is slightly smaller than the Red Kangaroo ("Macropus rufus") and the Eastern Grey Kangaroo ("Macropus giganteus"). Babies are born in the summer (February-March), and leave the mother's pouch in Novemember, at the start of the wet season.
Climate change could mean that this kangaroo could become extinct in the future.
