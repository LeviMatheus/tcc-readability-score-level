The 1900 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad, were held in 1900 in Paris, France. No opening or closing ceremonies were held but competitions began on May 14 and ended on October 28. The Games were held as part of the 1900 World's Fair. Over a thousand athletes competed in 19 different sports. Women took part in the games for the first time and Charlotte Cooper became the first female Olympic champion. Many American athletes opposed competing on a Sunday because they travelled as representatives of their colleges and were expected to withdraw rather than compete on the "sabbath".
Most of the winners in 1900 were given cups or trophies instead of medals. Professionals competed in fencing and Albert Robert Ayat, who won the epee for amateurs and masters, was awarded a prize of 3000 francs.
