Shorts are a sort of trousers or pants worn by both men and women that reach only to the upper part of the legs or more, but don't cover the entire length of the leg. They are worn either as outer garment or as underwear. They are called "shorts" because they are a shortened version of "trousers" (as they are called in British English, or "pants" in American English) which cover the entire leg.
