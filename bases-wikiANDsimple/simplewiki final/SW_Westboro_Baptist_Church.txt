Westboro Baptist Church is a church in Topeka, Kansas. The leader of the church is a man named Fred Waldron Phelps, Sr. The church is centred around the belief that homosexuality -- that is when a man loves a man or a woman loves a woman -- is something that is very bad. It looks like they believe that it is the cause for every tragedy on Earth, including the deaths of soldiers killed in war. They certainly think that a lot of tragedies result from love between a man and a man or love between a woman and a woman, and the tolerance of it.
Most Christian churches, even ones that feel that this kind of love is wrong, do not agree with the way this church practices. They feel it is not the same as what they think are the true Christian teachings: While Westboro Baptist Church thinks that God hates homosexuals and anyone who tolerates them, Christian churches think that God loves everybody.
