Gallimimus (rooster mimic) was a fast-running dinosaur with a very long, thin, flattened, toothless, horny beak, a small head, and a relatively large brain, are lived in the late Cretaceos period, about 75-70 million years ago.
Description.
The bottom front part of its beak was shaped like a shovel. It had large eyes positioned on opposite sites of its head, ruling out binocular vision (depth perception). It had a long neck, long tail, and long legs. Gallimimus was about 13-20 ft (4-6 m) long, was 6.3 ft (1.9 m) tall at the hips, and may have weighed about 970 pounds (440 kg).
In popular culture.
The dinosaur appeared on-screen, in the motion picture Jurassic Park.
