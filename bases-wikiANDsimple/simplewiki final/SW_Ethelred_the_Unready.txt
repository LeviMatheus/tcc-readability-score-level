Ethelred II (c. 968 â€“ April 23, 1016), was also known as Ethelred the Unready. He was King of England twice. The first time was from 978 to 1013, and the second time was 1014 to 1016). He was the son of Edgar, and Aelfthryth. For most of his reign he had to fight off Viking invaders.
The word "unready" in his name means "badly advised". When he asked for ideas about how to do things he was told the wrong thing. Because he was only ten, he did not know what was the best way of doing things.
