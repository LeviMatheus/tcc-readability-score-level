Minimal Instruction Set Computer (MISC) is a processor architecture with a very small number of basic instruction operations and corresponding opcodes. As a result of this is a smaller instruction set, a smaller and faster instruction set decode unit, and faster operation of individual instructions. The disadvantage is that smaller instruction set always have more sequential dependencies, reducing instruction-level parallelism.
