Linguine are a form of Italian pasta. Sometimes they are also called Linguini (this is an English-language form, and is not Italian). They are flat, like fettuccine and trenette, but narrow like spaghetti. The name means "little tongues" in Italian. Linguine "alle vongole" (with clams) is a popular use of this sort of pasta.
