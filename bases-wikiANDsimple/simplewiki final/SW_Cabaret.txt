Cabaret is a form of entertainment featuring comedy, song, dance, and theatre, caberets are mainly performed in a restaurant or nightclub with a stage for performances and the audience sitting at tables (often dining or drinking) watching the performance. The venue itself can also be called a "cabaret."
The term is a French word for the taprooms or cafés where this form of entertainment was born, as a more artistic type of café-chantant. It is derived from Middle Dutch "cabret", through Old North French "camberette", from Late Latin "camera". It essentially means "small room."
Cabaret also refers to a Mediterranean-style brothel — a bar with tables and women who talk to, arouse and entertain the clients. Traditionally these establishments can also feature some form of stage entertainment: often singers & dancers — the bawdiness of which varies with the quality of the establishment. It is the classier, more sophisticated cabaret that eventually engendered the type of establishment and art form that is the subject of the remainder of this article.
