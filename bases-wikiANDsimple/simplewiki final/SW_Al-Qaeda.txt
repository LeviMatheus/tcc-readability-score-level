al-Qaeda (Arabic language: القاعدة, al-Qā‘idah; for "the foundation" or "the base"; it can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, el-Qaida, or al Qaeda) is a worldwide militant Islamic terrorist organization. People think it is led by Osama bin Laden. The organisation wants to make new governments using its ideas about Islam. Members of al Qaeda believe their ideas of radical (extreme) Islamicism do not go together with democracy. They want to fight Western and liberal governments, most of all the United States.
People say, members of the organisation have performed many acts of terrorism. These acts were usually directed against the United States, and other liberal countries. The most well-known attacks include the September 11, 2001 attacks, the bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the attack on the US Navy ship USS Cole in 2000.
