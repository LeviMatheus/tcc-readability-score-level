Dromiceiomimus was a bipedal dinosaur from the late Cretaceous period, about 80 to 65 million years ago. It was an ornithomimid (bird-like dinosaur) around 4m (12 feet) long. They ate eggs from other dinosaurs and insects. They were noted for their large eyes and may have been nocturnal. It could also run exremely fast, speculated at 64 kph or 40 mph. It resided in North America.
Discovery.
It was first described in the 1920s as Struthiomimus, but was renamed to Dromiceiomimus in 1972 when the Genus was divided into 3 separate genera. Dromiceiomimus means “emu mimic” (the emu is a modern flightless bird similar to an ostrich).
