Anarcho-capitalism is an anarchist philosophy that is against the idea of political government, and for economic government through free market capitalism with supply and demand.
Anarcho-capitalists think that people can protect themselves without any government. Instead of putting a stop to intrusion with more laws, people could protect their own things, or agree to pay other people such as arbitrators, insurrers, and private defenders to protect them through the marketplace. Anarcho-capitalists say that the government is a thief, because it takes taxes away from people against their will, and keeps them from making agreements between themselves.
