The Church of England is a protestant church in England, with its head being the English monarch (who is Elizabeth II). It is a mother church of the Anglican Communion.
History.
The Church of England was created by King Henry VIII in 1534. Henry VIII was married to Catherine of Aragon, but asked the Pope to annul the marriage (say that there was a mistake and that Henry and Catherine were never really married). He had wanted to annul the marriage because he wanted a male heir to his throne and Catherine could not produce one. When the annulment was refused, Henry VIII used his position as King to breakaway from the Roman Catholic Church, and establish the Church of England, sometimes called the Anglican ("English") Church.
