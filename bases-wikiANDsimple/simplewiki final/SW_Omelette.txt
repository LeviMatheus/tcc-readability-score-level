An omelette or "omelet" is a type of food that is mainly eggs, with various fillings. In the United States "omelets" are usually eaten at breakfast. However omelettes can be eaten as a light lunch or late evening meal.
Making an Omelette.
An omelette is prepared from beaten eggs cooked with butter or oil in a frying pan. The thin, flat omelette is usually folded around a filling such as cheese, vegetables, meat, or some combination of these ingredients. Omelettes are eaten in many parts of the world. In some traditions, omelettes are fried to cook the bottom and then flipped over so that the eggs cook all the way through. However, in other traditions, the omelette is baked to cook it evenly or the top is cooked under a broiler. When making an omelette, it is best to use several eggs. Put a little water in with the eggs when you mix them up because the water helps the eggs to produce steam as they cook. The steam makes them lighter and fluffier. Using oil in the bottom of a nonstick omelette pan helps prevent the omelette from sticking. Follow these tips, add your favourite filling, and you will make a tasty omelette quickly and easily.
