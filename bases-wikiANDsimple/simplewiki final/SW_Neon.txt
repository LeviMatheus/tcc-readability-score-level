Neon is a gas. It is chemical element 10 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Ne.
The word "neon" comes from the Greek word meaning "new". It was discovered by William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers in 1898.
Neon does not react with other elements, so it is found by itself. There is not much neon in the air, and it is clear, so we do not see it.
Neon gas is used in lamps. When electricity goes through the neon, it lights up in many different colors. That is why it's used in neon signs.
