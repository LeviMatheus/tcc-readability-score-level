The province of Bozen wanted more autonomy, because the main German-speaking community of Italy lives there.
In the province of Trient, the people speak Italian. It has 339 official towns.
The majority of people in Alto Adige/Südtirol speaks german. However more italian speakers live in the capital of Bolzano.
A tiny minority group called the Ladins lives in the Dolomites region: they speak an old Rheto-Romanic language.
Words and ways of talking in this area are spread in the valleys around the Dolomites mountain group: Gardena, Badia Mareo Valley (Alto Adige/Südtirol)and Fassa Valley (Trentino). Ladin is also spoken in the town of Cortina d'Ampezzo and areas around there.
The Ladin language of the Fassa Valley Ladin is more like Italian: the Ladins of this valley speak a language with a lot of Italian or Trentino style sentences.
