Gold is a soft, heavy, dark yellowish piece of shiny metal that has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world, for jewelry, as money, and now in tooth fillings and electronic equipment such as computers. It was especially admired as jewelry in early times because of its great luster and beauty. In Exodus it was used as part of the clothes the priests wore. The color of this metal is also called "gold".
Chemical properties.
In chemistry, gold is chemical element 79, a transition metal in Group 11. It has an atomic weight of 199.96 a.m.u. Its symbol is Au, from the Latin word for gold, "aurum".
Gold is very soft, which means it can be hammered into thin sheets; and ductile, which means it can be pulled into wire. When it is used in money or in jewelry, it is often mixed with silver or some other metal to make it harder.
Most metals are gray in color. Gold's yellow color comes from the way that electrons behave in it.
There have been many discoveries of gold in Australia. The most important discovery of gold there was probably discovered by Sir Edward Hargraves. He started the first Australian gold rush.
