The Motherwell Football & Athletic Club Ltd.
is a Scottish football club based in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire. Motherwell currently play in the Scottish Premier League; their home stadium is Fir Park. Mark McGhee was appointed as the club's manager on June 18, 2007, with former club captain Scott Leitch, as his assistant manager.
Fir Park.
Due to safety concerns, the capacity at Fir Park is limited to 13,742, all-seated. This is because of the Taylor Report. The average attendance for the 2006-07 season was 5,885. The club's record attendance for a home match is 35,632, against Rangers in a Scottish Cup quarter-final replay on March 12, 1952.
The record transfer fee paid by the club was that to Everton for John Spencer in 1999 (GPB 500,000) and the highest received was that for Phil O'Donnell for his move to Celtic in 1994 (GBP 1,750,000). O'Donnell later rejoined Motherwell but died after collapsing on the pitch in a game against Dundee United on December 29, 2007.

Sponsorship.
Motherwell are currently sponsored by Anglian Home Improvements. The deal was announced on May 11, 2006 and is due to expire at the end of the 2007-08 season. They replaced Zoom Airlines, who're owned by club director John Boyle, and who still advertise on both the Davie Cooper Stand and the South Stand. The previous sponsor, from 2002-04, was a local company called The Untouchables. Previously the club had a long-term association with Motorola, but this ended after 11 years in 2002 as the sponsor started to reduce its manufacturing operations in Scotland. This had in turn followed another long-term association with local car dealer Ian Skelly, who had sponsored the club since 1984.
The club have had a number of different kit manufacturers since the 1970s. Bukta are the 2007-08 season kit providers, taking over from Xara, who had previously filled this role from 1998. Major manufacturers Adidas, Admiral, Hummel, Patrick, Pony and Umbro, have all been kit providers for Motherwell.
For the 2008-09 season, the club's shirt sponsor will be JAXX, a German gambling company.
