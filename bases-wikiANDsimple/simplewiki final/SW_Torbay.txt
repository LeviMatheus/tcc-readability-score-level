Torbay is a Unitary authority in England. 120,000 people live there. It is on the south coast aqnd has over 20 beaches. Tourism is very important to the local economy.
Torbay is not a town. Rather, it contains three towns (Torquay, Paignton and Brixham) and a few villages, the largest of which is Galmpton.
Torbay was first created as a county borough in 1967, uniting the urban districts of its three towns. In 1974 it became a borough of Devon, its surrounding county. Then in 1993 It was given unitary authority status, having the powers of both a borough and a county. In 2007 a referendum led to the adoption of a directly elected Mayor.
