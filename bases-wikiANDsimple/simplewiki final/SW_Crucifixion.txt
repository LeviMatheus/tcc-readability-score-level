Crucifixion is a method of execution, the deliberate killing of someone, usually because they have committed some crime. The most famous person to have been crucified was Jesus Christ, the Son of God in the Christian religion. He was nailed to a cross-shaped piece of wood - this is known as crucifixion. The cross later became a symbol of Christianity, and is often a part of a church steeple. Other crucifixions include Saint Andrew, the patron saint of Scotland, who was crucified on two diagonal pieces of wood, since he did not wish to die in the same manner as Jesus.
