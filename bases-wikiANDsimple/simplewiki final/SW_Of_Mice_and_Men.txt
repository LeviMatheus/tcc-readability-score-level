"Of Mice and Men" is a book writen by John Steinbeck in 1937. This is a story about two farm workers, George Milton and Lennie Small, during the Great Depression. One of its main themes is that "the best-laid plans of mice and men often go astray". This comes from Robert Burns' poem "To a Mouse". The original line was "The best-laid schemes o' mice and men aft gang agley". This means that even if something is planned well, it can still go wrong. It takes place in the 1920s, in California. In the 1920s, racial segregation was common and many people were poor.
