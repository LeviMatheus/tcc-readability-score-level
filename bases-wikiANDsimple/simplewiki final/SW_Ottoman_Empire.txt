The Ottoman Empire was an empire that lasted from 1299 to 1922. It was centered around the Middle East and western portions of lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The empire was created by Ottoman Turks and became a long-lasting empire. When it was most powerful (around 1400 to 1600), the Ottoman Empire controlled trade and politics in Europe, Asia, and Africa. The empire's capital was Istanbul. In later yesrs, the Ottoman Empire began to weaken and was known as "the sick man of Europe".
In early times of the empire, shahzadahs, who were the sons of the Sultan, used to be sent to Sanjaks to have experience to govern for future because they were candidates of Sultanate and Khaliphate but after Ahmed this system changed. In the new system the Sultan would keep all his male relatives locked in a small apartment called a "kafes" where they would never see the outside world. This was to keep them from taking power from him. But many times, a new Sultan would simply have his male relatives killed. This may seem as a bad thing but it is a good solution aganist the fights to be Sultan and rebel movements. The women in his harem would try to get more power, and the Sultan's mother became the most powerful political force in the Empire. This is because each mother in the harem would try to make her own son the next Sultan, since they knew he would probably be killed if he was not. The Sultans quickly lost their ability to govern far-away territories well, and all the people living in the Empire were soon governing themselves under their own laws. In the end, the Ottoman Empire grew so tired and decadent that it was easy for it to collapse.
