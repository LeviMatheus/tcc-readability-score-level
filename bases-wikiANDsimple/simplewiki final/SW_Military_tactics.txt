Military tactics (Greek: "TaktikÄ“", the art of organizing an army) are the techniques for using weapons or military units to fight an enemy in battle.
Tactics has changed over time following changes in philosophy and technology.
Specialized tactics exist for many situations, ranging from securing a room or individual building, to large-scale operations such as establishing air superiority over a region. Today, military tactics are employed at all levels of command, from individual and group up to entire armed forces.
Common military tactics include frontal assaults, attempts to flank the enemy, keeping troops in reserve and the use of ambushes.
