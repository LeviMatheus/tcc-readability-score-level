Ammonium sulfide, also know as the "stink bomb" is made up of a solution of ammonium sulfide in water, sealed inside a glass ampoule (a small bottle-like container used to store a liquid securely). When the ampoule is broken, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gases are released from the solution. These chemicals have a very strong and unpleasant smell.
Ammounium sulfide is a highly toxic chemical. It is also explosive and highly flammable. It is an additive in cigarettes.
