Olive-backed Forest Robin ("Stiphrornis pyrrholaeumus") (Turdinae) is a bird discovered recently in Gabon. Hall et Moreau recognized as monotypic species merged in Forest Robin, type species "S.erythrothorax", and the recent studies confirm this arrangement, i.e. the genetic distance between the two taxa does not deserve species status.
