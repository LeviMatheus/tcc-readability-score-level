The Hilton Hotels brand was re-united internationally after more than 40 years in February 2006, when United States-based Hilton Hotels Corporation purchased the lodging arm of United Kingdom-based Hilton Group PLC, which had acquired Hilton's international operations in 1987 (the companies had been severed originally in 1966).
Hilton Hotels became America's first coast-to-coast hotel chain in 1943. The company places marketing emphasis on business travel, but owns and operates a number of resorts and leisure-oriented hotels as well.
As of April 2007, the chain has 229 Hilton branded hotels across the world and has partnerships with many airlines and car rental companies.
