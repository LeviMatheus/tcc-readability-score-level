"Rayman Raving Rabbids" is a party video game made by Ubisoft for the Wii, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS game consoles. It's a spin-off of the "Rayman" series where Rayman has to thwart the Rabbids, the bad guys of the game, playing mini-games to do this. The Game Boy Advance and DS versions are platform games like older "Rayman" titles with less mini-games.
