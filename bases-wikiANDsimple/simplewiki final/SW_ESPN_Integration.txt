ESPN Integration is an agreement between ESPN and Electronic Arts to put various ESPN features in their games. The first game to feature ESPN Integration was "MVP 06 NCAA Baseball". The features that have so far appeared include a streaming ticker at the bottom of the screen with real up to date sports scores, just as it appears on the ESPN channel. This ticker does not just crawl during menus and load screens but also in actual gameplay. Another feature is the ability to listen to sports updates from ESPN Radio, and a third feature is being able to read the top 40 sports stories from ESPN.com.
