"Public-key cryptography", also known as asymmetric cryptography, is a form of cryptography in which the key used to encrypt a message differs from the key used to decrypt it. In public key cryptography, each user has a pair of cryptographic keysâ€”a public key and a private key. The private key is kept secret, while the public key may be widely distributed and used by other users. Incoming messages would have been encrypted with the "recipient's public key" and can only be decrypted with his corresponding private key. The keys are related mathematically, but the user private key cannot be derived from the widely used public key.
On the other hand, "secret key cryptography", also known as symmetric cryptography, uses a single secret cryptographic key for both encryption and decryption. To use symmetric cryptography for communication, both the sender and receiver need to know the key earlier, or the key would have to be sent along with the message.
