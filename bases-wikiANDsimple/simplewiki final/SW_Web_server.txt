A web server is a computer with a boot device or other disk containing a web site. The term may also refer to an application that helps a computer to perform web server functions.
If one site runs more than one server they must use different
port numbers. Alternatively, several hostnames may be
mapped to the same computer in which case they are known as
Apache and NCSA HTTPd are two popular web servers.
There are many others including some for practically every
platform. Servers differ mostly in the "server-side"
features they offer such as server-side includes, and in
their authentication and access control mechanisms. All
decent servers support CGI and most have some binary API
Server Languages.
To work with the server, they must be a web-based language instead of being a language which is used to make normal computer programs.
