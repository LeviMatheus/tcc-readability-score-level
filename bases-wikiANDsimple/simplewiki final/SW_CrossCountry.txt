CrossCountry is a train operating company, the brand name of XC Trains Limited owned by Arriva, that has operated Great Britainâ€™s Cross Country rail franchise since 11 November 2007. The franchise was formed through the amalgamation of most of the former Cross Country franchise previously held by Virgin Trains (which consisted of inter-city services that do not terminate in London) with some of the longer-distance routes (including some former Central Citylink services) operated by the former Central Trains.
