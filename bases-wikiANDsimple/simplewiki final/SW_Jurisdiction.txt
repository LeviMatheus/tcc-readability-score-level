In law, jurisdiction (from the Latin "jus, juris" meaning "law" and "dicere" meaning "to speak": means: telling the law) is the authority given to a judge to take decisions in matters concerning the law.
It also includes the authority a of formally constituted legal body or a political leader to deal with legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility.
Jurisdiction relies on Public International Law, Conflict of Laws, Constitutional Law and the powers of the executive and legislative branches of government to give resources to best serve the needs of its society.
