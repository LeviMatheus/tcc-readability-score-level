A penlight is a small flashlight in the shape of a pen. A penlight is usually uses a small light known as an "LED" (Light Emitting Diode) but it can also use a small lightbulb made just for small flashlights.
The LED lights up when power is run through it. Making the penlight light up is as simple as pressing a button, or screwing the end on tighter so it makes contact with the batteries.
Most of the time, penlights use two or three AAA or AAAA batteries. AAAA are a newer, thinner type of battery, most commonly found in small electronics.
Penlights can be made out of plastic or metal, and can be any color. They most often have a little clip, to hold it on your shirt or something.
