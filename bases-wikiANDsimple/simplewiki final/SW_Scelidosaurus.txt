"Scelidosaurus" (meaning "limb lizard") was a genus of quadrupedal, lightly plated, herbivorous dinosaur about 4 metres long. It lived during the Early Jurassic period, during the Sinemurian to Hettangian stages around 194 to 208 million years ago. Its fossils have been found in both England and in Arizona, in the United States.
