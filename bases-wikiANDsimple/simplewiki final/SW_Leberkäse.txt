(sometimes called "Leberkäs" or "Leberka(a)s", in Switzerland usually called "Fleischkäse") is a meat specialty. It originally was from the South of Germany. It can also be found in Austria and Switzerland. It is similar to meat loaf. It is made of corned beef, sometimes pork, bacon and onions. The ingredients are ground till they are very fine. They are then packed together into loaves. These are baked in an oven, till they get a brown crust.
Who made the first Leberkäse.
The cook of the Bavarian duke Karl Theodor is said to have invented Leberkäse in 1776. Many people believe this to be false though. The word "Leberkäse" literally translates to "liver-cheese". There is neither cheese nor liver in the dish, though. Some linguists say, that the word may be related to the German word "lab", which means to clot, or the word "Laib" (loaf). Perhaps it also contains the Slavic root "quas" (feast).
What can be in Leberkäse.
According to German food laws, only products called "Bavarian Leberkäse" are allowed not to have liver in them; otherwise, there must be a minimum liver content of 4%. Some local variants must contain even more liver; for example, the liver content of "Stuttgarter Leberkäse" must be at least 5%.
