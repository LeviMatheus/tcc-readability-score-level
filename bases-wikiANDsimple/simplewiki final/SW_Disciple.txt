A disciple is a student or a follower of some teacher, for example, it is often used to mean a disciple of Jesus Christ, whom Christians believe to be the son of God. Disciples of Jesus often live their life in a very simple way. Disciples are sometimes confused with apostles, who were people chosen by Jesus himself.
