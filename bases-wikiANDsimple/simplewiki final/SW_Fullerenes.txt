Fullerenes are soccer ball shaped forms of carbon, usually containing 60 carbon atoms. As in graphite, each molecule is bonded to three others. However, the molecule contains both five-membered as well as six-membered rings.
The melting point for the molecules is over 1000 degrees. If you heat them at about 300 degrees a vapor will form from the solid. They are named after a man called Buckminster Fuller, who was famous for his geodesic domes that look like a half of a soccer ball.
