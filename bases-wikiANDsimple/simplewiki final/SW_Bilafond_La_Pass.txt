Bilafond La (meaning "Pass of the Butterflies"), also known as the Saltoro Pass, is a mountain pass situated on Saltoro Ridge, which sits immediately west of the vast Siachen Glacier. Currently held by Pakistan, the pass lies near the Line of Control dividing Indian- and Pakistani-administered territory.
