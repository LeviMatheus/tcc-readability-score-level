Lemurs are primates related to the first monkeys and apes. The word "lemur" comes from the Latin word "lemures", which means "spirits of the night". This name refers to many of the nocturnal lemur species and their large eyes.
Lemur may be any member of the four lemuriform families, but it is also the genus of one of the lemuriform species. Other mammals called lemurs are the two flying lemurs, but they are not lemurs.
Lemurs live on the island of Madagascar and some smaller islands next to it, for example the Comoros. They weigh from 30g to the 10kg. Larger species have all become extinct since human groups moved to Madagascar. Usually, the smaller lemurs are active at night (nocturnal), and the larger ones are active during the day (diurnal).
The small lemurs are omnivores, they eat fruits, flowers and leaves (and sometimes nectar), and insects, spiders, and small vertebrates. Some species are herbivores, but they can also eat insects.
Today, there are approximately 32-35 living lemur species. All lemurs are endangered species, because people destroy their habitat and hunt them.
