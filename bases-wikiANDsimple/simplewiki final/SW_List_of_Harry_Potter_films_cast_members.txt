__NOTOC__
The following is a list of cast members who voiced or played characters appearing in the "Harry Potter" film series. The list is sorted by film and character, because some characters may have been portrayed by multiple actors.
The list also includes cast members who will definitely appear in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix", which will be released in July 2007. A light grey box under the "Order of the Phoenix" heading means that the character does not appear in the book, so his or her appearance in the film would not follow the original story. A dark grey box means the character does appear in the book but has not yet been cast, or, if as some boxes say, will not be cast. "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" will release in 2008, which was delayed to 2009. "Deathly Hallows" will release part 1 in 2010, and part 2 in 2011.
