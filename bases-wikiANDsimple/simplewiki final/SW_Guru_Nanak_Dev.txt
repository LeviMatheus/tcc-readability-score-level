Guru Nanak Dev (October 20 1469 in Nankana Sahib, Punjab, Pakistan â€“ September 7 1539 in Kartarpur, Punjab, India) was the founder of Sikhism, and the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. There are ten Gurus who are important to Sikhs. The last Guru said that there would be no more Gurus after him and Sikhs would be taught by the Sikh holy book, which is called Guru Granth Sahib. The word Guru means religious teacher.
Beside followers of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev is considered holy by Punjabi Hindus and Sahajdhari Sindhis across the Indian subcontinent. His main teaching to the world was written down to be "devotion of thought and having good actions as the first of our jobs".
