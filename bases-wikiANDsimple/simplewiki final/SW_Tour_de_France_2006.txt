The 2006 Tour de France was the "93rd Tour de France". It took place from July 1 to July 23, 2006. The winner was Ã“scar Pereiro. Floyd Landis was the first person to finish the race, but was disqualified on September 20, 2007 for taking the drug testosteron during the 17th stage of the race.
The Tour began in Strasbourg, on the French-German border. It ended Sunday July 23 in Paris. The distance of the race was 3657 km (2272 mi). The race was the third fastest in average speed. Along the way, the cyclists passed through six different countries including France, The Netherlands (a stop at Valkenburg in Stage 3), Belgium (at Huy, Stages 3 and 4), Luxembourg (at Esch-sur-Alzette, Stages 2 and 3), Germany (though not stopping there, Stage 1) and Spain (Pla-de-Beret, Stage 11). For the first time since the 1999 race, there was no team time trial.
One day before the start of the Tour, there was a doping-scandal. 13 racers were removed from the tour, because it was believed that they were working together with Fuentes. Two of the 13 riders were the expected to do well in the race. They were Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso.
