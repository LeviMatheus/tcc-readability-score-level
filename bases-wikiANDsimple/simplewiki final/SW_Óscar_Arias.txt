Oscar Arias, born on 13 September 1940 in the city of Heredia, is the current President of Costa Rica. He was also president from 1986-1990. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end civil wars which were happening in several Central American countries.
Arias started on his political career in the 1970's.
In January of 2005 Arias was selected as the candidate for the National Liberation party, and he is reelected for president of Costa Rica from 2006-2010. There was a lot of polemic and criticism for his support towards the TLC process in Costa Rica, but because of his political background and determination, most Costa Ricans still trust and respect Arias and his decisions for the well-being of the country.
He is also a recipient of the Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism and a trustee of the Economists for Peace and Security.
