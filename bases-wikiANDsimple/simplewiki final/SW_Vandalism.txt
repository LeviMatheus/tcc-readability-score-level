"For the Wikipedia term, please see Vandalism."
Vandalism is destroying or damaging the property of another. A person that does this is called a "vandal". This includes graffiti and website damage. This is usually illegal. Often, vandals do this because they think it is funny or because they want attention or to feel big, or bad.
The name "vandal" is from the Vandals, a group of people who ruined Ancient Rome in the year 455 CE.
Vandalism is almost always a crime; different types of vandalism include: graffiti, smashing the windows of cars and houses, and rioting.
