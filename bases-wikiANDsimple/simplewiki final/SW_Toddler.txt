A toddler is a child between the ages of one to three years old. During this time, the child learns how to use their hands, stand and walk, and also how to communicate with others.
Most children are toilet trained ("potty training") while they are toddlers.
Even when toddlers can walk, they are often transported in a stroller (buggy, pushchair, push-chair), when they are tired, or for long distances.
