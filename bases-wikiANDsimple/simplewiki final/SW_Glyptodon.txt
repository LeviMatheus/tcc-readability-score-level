Glyptodon was one of the biggest ancient armadillos. Fossils of this car-sized mammal have been found in Argentina, South America. Glyptodon lived in the Ice Ages, during the Pleistocene (between 2 million and 15,000 years ago). Glyptodon (meaning "carved tooth") was named by paleontologist R. Owen in 1839. These herbivores (plant-eaters) may have been preyed upon by saber-toothed cats.
