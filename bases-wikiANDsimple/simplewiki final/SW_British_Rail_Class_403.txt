The Southern Railway (SR) gave the designation 5BEL to the 5-car all-Pullman electric multiple units built to work the prestigious Brighton Belle trains between London Victoria and Brighton. These units survived long enough in British Rail ownership to be allocated TOPS Class 403. Between 1933 and 1935 the units were designated 5PUL (the 'PUL' code was then used for the 6PUL units).
