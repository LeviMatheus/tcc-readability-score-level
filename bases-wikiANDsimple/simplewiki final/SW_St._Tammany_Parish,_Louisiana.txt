St. Tammany Parish (French: "Paroisse de Saint-Tammany") is a parish located in the U.S. state of Louisiana, in the New Orleans metropolitan area. The parish seat is Covington, and as of 2000, the population was 191,268. In 2004, the population was estimated to have grown to 212,000, and after the landfall of Hurricane Katrina the following year, the population was estimated by St. Tammany Planners to be about 264,000. Most new residents are thought to have come from St. Bernard Parish. If correct, these figures make St. Tammany Parish the fastest-growing parish in the state, overtaking Livingston and Ascension parishes.
