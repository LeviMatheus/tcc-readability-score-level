The Erfurt massacre was a series of shootings that happened at the Gutenberg Gymnasium in Erfurt, Germany, on April 26, 2002.
A boy that had been expelled from the school, Robert Steinh√§user, was the person who did all the shooting. In anger, he came into the Gymnasium, and shot dead 13 teachers, two students, and a police officer. After a teacher caught him and put Robert in an empty room, Robert shot and killed himself.
In total, 17 people were killed that day.
