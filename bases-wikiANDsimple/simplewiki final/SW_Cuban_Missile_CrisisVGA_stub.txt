The Cuban Missile Crisis was a period of tension between the Soviet Union and the United States, using Cuba as a battleground. It happened when the Soviet Union began building missile sites in Cuba in 1962.
Cuba took over some American businesses which were making things there. America refused to buy anything from Cuba after that. America was worried that the USSR would attack America through Cuba, since Cuba is near enough to the United States that the missiles could reach any important American city.
America blocked ships from going into Cuba. The Soviets and Cubans agreed to remove the missiles if America did not invade Cuba. America later removed some missiles from the country of Turkey, near the Soviet Union. But whether anyone "won" isn't really known, and the USSR lost China's support over it.
