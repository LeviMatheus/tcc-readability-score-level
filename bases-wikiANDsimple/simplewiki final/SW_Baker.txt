A baker is somebody who makes mainly bread. Some bakers also make cakes and desserts, but a traditional baker only makes bread. The place where a baker works is called a bakehouse or a bakery.
The first bread was made by the Egyptians in 8000 BC and in the Middle ages most landlords had a bakery. They had a public oven and housewives brought the dough to the baker to cook.
Bread is now much sweeter than it was in the Middle Ages because a lot of corn syrup or honey is used.
