A seizure is when the nerves of somebody act strangely. Nerves transmit information. They do this by electrical impulses and by some chemical substances called transmitters.
"Status epilepticus" is a seizure that lasts much longer than normal, sometimes more than 30 minutes. The person faints while the seizure is happening. These are treatable by the use of a medicine called "Diazepam" which is given from a tube into the bowels of the person, through the anus. Whether treated or not, the person must get to a hospital as soon as possible, as their brain could be permanently damaged otherwise.
Certain types of seizures point to a disorder called epilepsy, where the nerves do not work as they should. They carry the wrong messages to the brain so that the person moves uncontrollably or sees, hears, smells, feels, or tastes things that aren't there. Medicine can be taken to prevent this from happening.
