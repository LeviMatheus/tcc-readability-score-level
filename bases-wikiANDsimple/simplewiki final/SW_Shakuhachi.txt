The is a Japanese flute which is played vertically (up-down) like a recorder, instead of transversely (from side to side) like the Western transverse flute. Its name means "1.8 foot", its size. It is traditionally made of bamboo, but others made in wood and plastic exist today. It was used by the monks of Zen Buddhism in the practice of "suizen" (blowing meditation).
