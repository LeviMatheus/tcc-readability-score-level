Turbostar is the name given to a series of diesel multiple units (DMU) built by Bombardier Transportation (previously ADtranz) at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby, England. The Turbostar was the first new train type to be introduced after the privatisation of British Rail, and is the most common type of diesel multiple unit (its electrical variant, the Electrostar, is the most common electric multiple unit). The first units were ordered by Chiltern Railways in 1996 and were designated Class 168 (also known as "Clubman"). Since then the family has grown with the addition of the Class 170, Class 171, and (in development) the Class 172.
