Taj Mahal is a beautiful tomb built in the 17th century by Moghul ruler Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is in the city of Agra, Uttar Pradesh, Republic of India. It is one of the seven wonders of the world. Many people think it is one of the most beautiful buildings ever built. It is slowly being destroyed by acid rain.
It is an example of Mughal architecture - a mixture of building design ideas from Islamic Indian, Persian (old Iran), and Muslim art customs.
Many people go to India to visit the Taj Mahal and it is one of India's biggest tourist attractions.
Shah Jahan was going to build an identical black tomb for himself, but he died before he even began to build, which is very sad because the two tombs together could have looked so great to see two marble structures.
