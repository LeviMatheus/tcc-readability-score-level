Cigarettes and Valentines was going to be an album by Green Day. It was recorded in the summer of 2003, but after making 20 tracks, the master tapes were stolen from the studio. The band was upset so decided not to try to re-create the stolen album, but instead started on a new album that they vowed would be even better than before. The new album was American Idiot.
The "Cigarettes and Valentines" album was rumoured to have been secretly released as "Money Money 2020" by The Network. The Network is a band that contains all the Green Day members under different names. Billie Joe (a member of Green Day) has gone on record admitting that The Network is Green Day's side project. However he also said that "Money Money 2020" is not "Cigarettes and Valentines".
