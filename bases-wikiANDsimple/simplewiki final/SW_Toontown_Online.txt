"Toontown Online" (also known as Toontown) is a online video game created by The Walt Disney Company. The game is an MMORPG, where a lot of people play at one time.
Players live life as a toon in Toontown. Players can make a duck, bear, rabbit, dog, cat, horse, pig, or monkey.
What the game's purpose is (object).
Players try to live life as a toon, playing games and making new friends. But it's not all paradise. Evil robots called COGS have taken over, and "gags" (cartoon fun) are used to defeat them. There isn't a purpose that players have to go by. A player can choose to be the top racer or to have the most "laffpoints". Many people like it because of this.
