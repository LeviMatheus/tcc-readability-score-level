Metadata (also Meta data") is data about data, that is information about other information. This is often useful. Libraries usually group books by subject. In this context, the metadata about the book can be what subject it is classified under. Digital cameras allow to take pictures. In that context, the data is the picture taken, the metadata is information about the picture taken, like what focal length was used, other details about the exposure. Very often, a date and time when the picture was taken is also included.
