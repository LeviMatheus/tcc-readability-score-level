Thomas Paine (January 29, 1737 – June 8, 1809) was an English pamphleteer, revolutionary, radical, inventor, and intellectual. He lived and worked in Britain until he was 37, when he emigrated to the British American colonies during American Revolution. His main contribution was the powerful, widely-read pamphlet "Common Sense" (1776), advocating colonial America's independence from the Kingdom of Great Britain, and of "The American Crisis" (1776–1783), a pro-revolutionary pamphlet series.
