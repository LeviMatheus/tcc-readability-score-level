The Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) is the hypothetical common language that was spoken before the Indo-European languages developed.
Discovery and reconstruction.
There are several competing hypotheses about when and where PIE was spoken.
The idea that there was such a language was supported by the fact, that in 1927 Jerzy Kury≈Çowicz discovered some of the phonemes, one supposed to be Proto-Indo-European in Anatolian.
Method.
There is no direct evidence of PIE, because it was never written. All PIE sounds and words are reconstructed from later Indo-European languages using the comparative method and the method of internal reconstruction. The asterisk is used to mark reconstructed PIE words, such as *' 'water', *' 'dog', or *' 'three (masculine)'. Many of the words in the modern Indo-European languages seem to have derived from such "protowords" via regular sound changes (e.g., Grimm's law).
Phonology.
Other long vowels may have appeared already in the proto-language by compensatory lengthening:.
