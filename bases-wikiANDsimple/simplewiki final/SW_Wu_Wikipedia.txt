The Wu Wikipedia is the Wu edition of Wikipedia, run by the Wikimedia Foundation. It started on 6 October 2006.
As a small community, from early on, Wu wikipedians have decided to follow the policies and rules of the English Wikipedia, wherever they are applicable. This idea has provided stability and allows wikipedians to concentrate on the content. As of December 15, 2008, the Wu Wikipedia has more than 75,000 edits, 2,700 articles, and more than 2,426 registered users, 4 of whom are administrators.
Wu is one of the five regional Chinese languages to have its own Wikipedia. The other four are: Cantonese Wikipedia (Main Page), Minnan Wikipedia (Main Page), Mindong Wikipedia (Main Page), and Hakka Wikipedia (Main Page). It is also the third largest Wikipedia edition of Chinese languages (including Classical Chinese Wikipedia).
