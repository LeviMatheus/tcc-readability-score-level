"A Midsummer Night's Dream" is a comedy, written by William Shakespeare. It is one of his most played pieces. It was written before 1598 when Frances Meres’ told about it in his Wit’s Treasury. Meres wrote, “so Shakespeare among the English is the most excellent in both kinds for the stage; for comedy, witness his Gentlemen of Verona, his Errors, his Love’s Labour’s Lost, his Love’s Labour’s Won, his Midsummer Night’s Dream, and his Merchant of Venice.” It is about four young lovers from Athens. It mostly plays in a forest. It has become known especially because the characters interact with faeries. Besides the theatre play, which is very popular, there are also several versions of fims about the subject. Benjamin Britten wrote an opera about it. The plays' characters include Lysander, Hermia, Demitrius, Helena, and others.
