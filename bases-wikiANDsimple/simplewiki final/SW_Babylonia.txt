Babylonia was a state in Mesopotamia a long time ago. It was named for the capital city, Babylon. Mesopotamia included Sumer, Akkad, and Assyria. It is important because it was one of the first places where humans lived together in a civilization. The people of Babylonia, or "Babylonians", had a written language that they used to learn things about the world around them. They wrote down the things they learned and this helped the young Babylonians learn more than the older Babylonians knew.
One of the most famous Babylonians was Hammurabi. He fought wars and made Babylonia bigger and created one of the earliest set of laws in the world.
The Babylonians were the ones who invented the first calendar, the 60-minute hour, and the advance multiplication table.
