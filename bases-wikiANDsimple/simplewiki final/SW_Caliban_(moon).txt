Caliban is the second biggest retrograde non-spherical moon of Uranus.
Caliban was found on 1997-09-06 by Brett J. Gladman, Philip D. Nicholson, Joseph A. Burns, and John J. Kavelaars using the 200-inch Hale telescope together with Sycorax and given the designation S/1997 U 1.
Designated Uranus XVI it was named after the monster character in William Shakespeare's play "The Tempest"..
The orbital parameters suggest that it may belong, together with Stephano to the same dynamic cluster, suggesting common origin.
The diameter is estimated at 72 km (assuming albedo of 0.04), making it the second biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus, half the size of Sycorax, the biggest non-spherical moon of Uranus.
The light curve suggests Caliban's rotation period is 2.7 hours.
