"Survival of the fittest" is a phrase first used by Herbert Spencer in his book "Principles of Biology", published in 1864. In the book, Spencer tried to apply the ideas behind evolution to certain fields of economics.
Charles Darwin, one of the discoverers of evolution, did not not talk about "survival of the fittest"; he spoke about natural selection. He used the term "survival of the fittest" only as a metaphor to describe natural selection. Today, biologists do not use the term any more, they use "natural selection".
An interpretation of the phrase to mean "only the fittest organisms will prevail" (a view common in social Darwinism) is not consistent with the actual theory of evolution. Any organism which is capable of reproducing itself on an ongoing basis will survive as a species, not just the "fittest" ones. A more accurate characterization of evolution would be "survival of the fit enough", although this is sometimes regarded as a tautology.
