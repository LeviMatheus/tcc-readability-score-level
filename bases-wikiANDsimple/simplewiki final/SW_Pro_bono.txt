Pro bono is a Latin phrase meaning "for [the] good", that is used to mean that a legal professional (lawyer) who would otherwise be paid money for his work,
contributes his labor without being paid, for the benefit of society,
typically on behalf of a person or organization who cannot pay for some reason, such as poverty.
