Nordic countries are a group of countries in the northern Europe. These countries are Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway. Scandinavia is not the same thing as Nordic countries even though some people say they are. Scandinavia is a peninsula while Nordic countries are countries. Sweden and Norway (and a small part of Finland) are located at Scandinavian peninsula. Scandinavia and Finland together belong to bigger peninsula that is Fennoscandia.
Nordic countries have similar state, law and culture. In history Nordic countries have gone many times together. Nordic countries are welfare states with a very high taxes. Nordic countries have some political co-operation, like Nordic council, but not very much. Co-operation with a larger group European Union makes Nordic co-operation even smaller. Finland is the only country that uses the euro.
There is a long and cold winter in Nordic countries, but only a small part of northern Norway and about a half of Iceland is arctic.
