Yusuf Islam was born in July 21, 1948, who is an English singer. He sang many of his early songs when he called himself "Cat Stevens". His real name is Stephen Demetre Georgiou. He became a Muslim in 1977. After 2 years, he took the name of Yusuf İslam. He has sold over 60 million albums around the world since the late 1960s as Cat Stevens or Yusuf İslam.
As a waiter in his father's cafe he began writing songs "to escape the mundanity of it all". Chart success was followed by adulation, touring, drug use, confusion, tuberculosis and, in the early 1970s, Islam's changed outlook and an album called Tea For The Tillerman.
Stevens nearly drowned in an accident in Malibu in 1975. Stevens described the event in a VH1 interview some years later: "I suddenly held myself and I said, 'Oh God! If you save me, I'll work for you.'" He had looked into Buddhism; Zen and I Ching, numerology, tarot cards and astrology", but when his brother David gave him a copy of the Qu'ran, Stevens began to convert to Islam.
He took the name of Yusuf Islam as a Muslim. He left the music industry for a long time, and even asked music companies not to sell his albums but of course this request was rejected.
He lives with his family in London, at the moment.
