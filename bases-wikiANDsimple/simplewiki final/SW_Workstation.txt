A workstation is a computer used for scientific or technical calculations, or purposes. These computers are usually expensive, high-end computers. They are different form the ordinary computers used for text-processing. Very often they have operating systems that allow several users to work at the computer at the same time. Very often, workstations are connected to a computer network. Computer terminals may be used to access them. Currently, almost all workstations use an unix or unix-like operating system.
