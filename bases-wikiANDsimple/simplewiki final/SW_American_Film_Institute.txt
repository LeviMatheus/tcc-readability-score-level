The American Film Institute (AFI) is an independent, organization that is designed not to make money created by the National Endowment for the Arts, which was started in 1967 when President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act.
George Stevens, Jr. was the first CEO. Since 1980, Jean Picker Firstenberg has been CEO.
Older figures in AFI's Conservatory train newer people.
The institute also wants to keep old film, which could soon be destroyed.
Even though its name only mentions film, AFI also works on television and video.
In 1973, the AFI began handing out Life Achievement Awards.
In 1998, when American cinema had existed for 100 years, AFI began its 100 Years Series, which helped people become interested in the history of movies.
Recently, it built and started the AFI Silver theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland near Washington, D.C.
