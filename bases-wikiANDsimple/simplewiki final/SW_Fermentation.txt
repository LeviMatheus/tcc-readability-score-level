Fermentation is the process in which cells convert glucose (or sugar) into either alcohol or vinegar along with some other products. Fermentation is an anaerobic reaction.
Equations.
Glycolysis usually takes place early on in the reaction, however, the later stages do not react using gylcolysis.
Types of fermentation.
When yeast ferments, it breaks down the glucose (C6H12O6) into ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and carbon dioxide (CO2).
