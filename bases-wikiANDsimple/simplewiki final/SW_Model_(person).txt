A model is a person who has the job of posing, or displaying works of art or fashion (clothes), usually for promotion of the product. They are often used for advertising in television and printed media, for example newspapers and magazines.
Types of models.
There are many different types of models. Some models only use certain parts of their bodies. For example, a "hand model" is a person who only uses their hands. A hand model would be used to display certain items, for example rings and watches. These types of model are usually only used for advertisements.
Fashion models are used to sell clothing or cosmetics. People who make clothing will often use fashion models to wear the clothing they make at fashion shows. The models will walk up and down a raised section of floor called the catwalk or "runway" to show the clothing to other people.
Fine art models are hired by photographers, painters and other artists to pose for their art.
