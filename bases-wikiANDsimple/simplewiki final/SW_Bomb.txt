A bomb is an explosive device that makes and lets out its energy very quickly and has a big shock wave. They have been used for centuries.
Most bombs do not contain more energy than ordinary fuel, except in the case of a nuclear weapon.
A bomb is usually some kind of container filled with explosive material that is designed to destroy things when it is set off. The word bomb comes from the Greek word "βόμβος" (bombos), an onomatopoeic term with almost the same meaning as "boom" in English.
Bombs are often used by the military to destroy enemy targets, by terrorists in suicide attacks, and by civilians in mining.
