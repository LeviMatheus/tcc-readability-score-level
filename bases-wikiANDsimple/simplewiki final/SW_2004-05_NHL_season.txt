The 2004–05 NHL season would have been the 88th regular season of the National Hockey League (NHL). The season was canceled on February 16, 2005 because of an unfinished lockout that began on September 16, 2004. The loss of the 2004–05 season made the NHL the first North American professional sports league to cancel an entire season because of a labour issue. It was also the first time since 1919 that the Stanley Cup was not awarded. In 1919, the championship was canceled due to the ongoing Spanish flu pandemic.
