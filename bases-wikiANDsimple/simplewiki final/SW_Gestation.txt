Gestation is the carrying of an embryo or fetus inside a female viviparous animal, until its birth.
In mammals, there is the possibility that one female can have multiple gestations at the same time. Such births are usually called twins. The time the female spends till the birth of the young is usually called gestation period. Humans have a gestation period of around 37 weeks or about 9 months and 1 week.
