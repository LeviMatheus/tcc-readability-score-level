A punt is a flat boat with a broad front, designed for use in small rivers or other shallow water.
Punting means boating in a punt. The punter pushes a pole against the river bed and this gives the punt a way to move.
Punts were originally built as cargo boats or platforms, for shooting at birds and fishing, but in modern times they are mostly used for pleasure trips on the rivers in the university towns of Oxford and Cambridge in England, and are raced at summer regattas on the Thames.
Punt poles.
Poles for pleasure punts are normally made of spruce, or aluminium. A normal pole is about 12–16 feet (4–5 m) long and weighs about 10 lb (5 kg). In Oxford and Cambridge 16 ft long poles are sometimes used.
The bottom of the pole is fitted with a metal "shoe", a rounded lump of metal to protect the end — the shoe is sometimes made in the shape of a swallow tail.
