Charley Kazim Uchea (born June 30, 1985) is an unemployed self-styled 'it girl' from, born in Southeast London, England. She was a contestant on "Big Brother" 8 in 2007. She is a former lap dancer from Stringfellow's Nightclub and cousin to Sunderland A.F.C. footballer Kieran Richardson.
Charley's entry was speculated on by the British tabloid press and she was negatively received by the live audience on the launch night. Whilst being in the house Charley claimed to have 'raved' with footballers such as Frank Lampard and John Terry, however, outside the house, the footballers have denied such rumours.
Kieran has boycotted Big Brother and his cousin saying that she is only using his fame to promote herself in the programme.
Charley Uchea was eventually voted out of the Big Brother house, having stayed much longer than many had predicted.
Charley was evicted on day 59 and has since been doing many interviews being a guest on the game show The Weakest Link.
Charley took Express Newspapers to court for publishing a story in the Daily Star newspaper about her suspected past being a hooker. The Daily Star published the story in June 19th, 2007. Charley is demanding Â£50,000 in damages from the publishers.
