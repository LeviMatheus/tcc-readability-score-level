The LNER Class A4 was a type of steam locomotive made in England in 1935. It was designed by Sir Nigel Gresley for the London North Eastern Railway. 35 locomotives were built in total.
They were designed to be very fast and had a very sleek shape. One of them, 4468 "Mallard", is the fastest steam locomotive ever made. It set a world speed record of 126 mph (202.8 km/h) on July 3, 1938.
Six A4s still exist today. The rest were scrapped when steam stopped being used to power trains in Britain.
