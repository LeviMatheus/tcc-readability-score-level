Rosh Hashanah (, literally "head of the year," Biblical:, Israeli:, Yiddish:) is a Jewish holiday commonly referred to as the "Jewish New Year." It is observed on the first day of Tishrei, the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar.
Rosh Hashanah is the first of the High Holidays or "Yamim Noraim" (), or "Asseret Yemei Teshuva" (The Ten Days of Repentance) which are days specifically set aside to focus on repentance that conclude with the holiday of Yom Kippur.
