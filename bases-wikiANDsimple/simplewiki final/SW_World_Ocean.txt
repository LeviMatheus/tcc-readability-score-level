The World Ocean, world ocean, or global ocean is a term used to define all the world's oceans as one big ocean.
It is divided into five oceans. These divisions are the Atlantic Ocean, Arctic Ocean (sometimes considered a sea of the Atlantic), Indian Ocean, Pacific Ocean, and Southern Ocean (some people think it is just the southern portions of the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans).
The approximate shape of the World Ocean can for most purposes be treated as constant, although in fact it is not: continental drift continually changes its structure.
