Asbestos is a natural mineral. It occurs naturally in all parts of the world. It is fiberous, heat resistant and non flammable. These properties made it very attractive as a component in building materials and other products such as insulation and automobile brake pads. People have used asbestos from the early times. Ancient Egyptian people have already used asbestos. Asbestos is extremely dangerous for human health, as it can cause breathing and lung problems if people are around it for a long period of time.
Asbestos was linked to cancer in the early 1970s and was replaced by other materials in most applications by 1980.
