The battle of Ðiện Biên Phủ happened in 1954. It was a battle between Vietnam and France, which Vietnam won. This led the French to give up in the First Indochinese War, or the French War, securing the independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the time. This was followed by the division of Vietnam into North and South and then the Second Indochinese War.
