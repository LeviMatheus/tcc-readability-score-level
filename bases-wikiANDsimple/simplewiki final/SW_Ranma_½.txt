Ranma Â½ is an anime which was based on a manga made by Rumiko Takahashi. It is 36 volumes long.
Story.
Ranma Saotome is the main character, who is 16-year old and is good at martial arts. This is because he learned from his father, a martial artist. Ranma was training with his father, Genma Saotome, when he falls into a spring which makes the people who fell inside turn into the people who fell inside before. The spring that Ranma fell into had a drowned girl inside before, so Ranma turned into a girl from then on whenever cold water was poured onto him. Genma fell into the spring of the panda, so he turned into a panda. Hot water made them turn back.
After training, both of them visit Soun Tendo, Genma's friend from a long time ago and his fighting partner for martial arts. Soun is also the teacher for a martial arts school. Then Soun tells Genma that he needs a grandchild to carry on the school, so he needs his daughter, Akane Tendo, to marry to get a child, who would receive an inheritance from him. Genma then says that Akane could marry Ranma, and so they become engaged.
Ranma 1/2 is the story of how Akane and Ranma begin to know each other and about other new friends they meet.
