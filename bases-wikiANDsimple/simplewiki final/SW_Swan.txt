A swan ("Cygnini") is a kind of water bird, from the genera Cygnus and Coscoroba. They are in the subfamily "Anserinae", in the family "Anatidae", which also includes geese and ducks.
They swim on top of the water and eat plants off the bottom of ponds, lakes, or oceans. They also eat insects and other small animals. Swans can also fly.
A baby swan is called a "cygnet". The name of the constellation "Cygnus" is from the Latin word for swan.
