The University of Cambridge (also called Cambridge University) is located in Cambridge, England. It is the second-oldest university of all English-speaking countries. It is thought of as one of the world's leading academic institutions.
The University grew out of a group of scholars in the city of Cambridge. Early records suggest that this happened in 1209 by scholars leaving Oxford after a dispute with local townsfolk there. The universities of Oxford and Cambridge are often jointly referred to as "Oxbridge".
In addition to cultural and practical associations as a historic part of English society, the two universities also have a long history of rivalry with each other.
Academically, Cambridge is consistently ranked in the world's top 5 universities.
