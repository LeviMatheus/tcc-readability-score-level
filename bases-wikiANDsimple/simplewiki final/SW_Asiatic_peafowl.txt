The Asiatic peafowl is a kind of bird. They are the genus "Pavo" from the Phasianidae family. They originally lived in Pakistan and India, Southeast Asia.
The male is called a "peacock", the female a "peahen".
The males are very colorful, and they have very long "train feathers" (or "tail feathers"), which they can move up like a fan. Females are less colorful, and do not have the long train-feathers. Both the male and the female have a little "crown" of feathers on their head.
Males show their train feathers to court a female peafowl, or to scare other animals away by making them afraid.
Peafowl are omnivorous and eat plant parts, flower petals, seeds, insects, and small vertebrates, like reptiles and amphibians.
