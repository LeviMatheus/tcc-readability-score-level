Ulysses is a novel by James Joyce. The complete book was first published in 1922, although parts of it had appeared elsewhere earlier.
The story takes place on a day in 1904, and is about a man named Leopold Bloom, who walks around Dublin. The day is June 16, 1904. The book also tells the story of Molly Bloom, his wife, and of Stephen Dedalus, a school teacher.
The book became famous for several reasons, but mainly because it is written in a new style called stream of consciousness. The book is now thought to be an important book of modernist literature. Many professors and teachers teach this book in universities and colleges.
