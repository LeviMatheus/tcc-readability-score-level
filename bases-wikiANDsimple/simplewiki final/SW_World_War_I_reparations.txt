World War I reparations means the payments and transfers of property and equipment that Germany was forced to make following its defeat during World War I.
Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the 'war guilt' clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all 'loss and damage' suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for reparations.
In January 1921, the total sum due was decided by an Inter-Allied Reparations Commission and was set at 269 billion gold marks (2,790 gold marks equalled 1 kilogram of pure gold), about Â£23.6 Billion, about $32 billion (roughly equivalent to $393.6 Billion US Dollars as of 2005). This was a sum that many economists deemed to be excessive because it would have taken Germany until 1984 to pay. Later that year, the amount was reduced to 132 billion marks, which still seemed astronomical to most German observers, both because of the amount itself as well as the terms which would have required Germany to pay until 1984.
Evolution of Reparations.
The 1924 Dawes Plan modified Germany's reparation payments. In May 1929, the Young Plan reduced further payments to 112 billion Gold Marks, US $28,350,000,000 over a period of 59 years (1988). In addition, the Young Plan divided the annual payment, set at two billion Gold Marks, US$473 million, into two components, one unconditional part equal to one third of the sum and a postponable part for the remaining two-thirds.
Because of the Great Depression there was an attempt to reach a moratorium. It failed, but
in the Lausanne Conference of 1932 it was decided to cancel reparations. By this time Germany had paid one eighth of the sum required under the Treaty of Versailles. But that became irrelevant upon Hitler's rise to power.
