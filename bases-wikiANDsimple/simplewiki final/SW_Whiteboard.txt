A whiteboard, also called a markerboard, is a surface on which markings made with markers are visible. It is used as a surface to write on. Whiteboards are often used to help teach. Special markers are used that can be erased. Whiteboards usually have a glossy surface. Last time, when the whiteboards were not yet created, people used blackboards, where you needed to use chalk instead of markers. Now, we have another improvement, people are now using electronic whiteboards, where it is controlled by a computer.
