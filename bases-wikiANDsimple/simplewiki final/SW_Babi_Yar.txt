Babi Yar is a ravine near Kiev in Ukraine.
On 28 September 1941, members of "Einsatzgruppe C" (mobile killing unit C), and other SS and German police units and Ukrainian auxiliaries, murdered more than half of the Jewish population of Kiev at Babi Yar, which is northwest of the city.
This was one of the largest mass murders at one place during World War II.
The Einsatzgruppe wrote to headquarters that 33,771 Jews were massacred in two days.
