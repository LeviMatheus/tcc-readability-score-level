Akkad (Sumerian: Agade, Bible: Accad) was an ancient city found in Mesopotamia. The ruins have never been found yet, but it is believed to be on the Euphrates river between Sippar and Kish. The area was called "Uri-ki" or "Ki-uri" in Sumerian.
According to the Sumerian king list, Akkad (Agade) was built by Sargon of Akkad. Even so, it is known from older cuneiform writings that the city was already there before Sargon, in the time of the kings of Uruk, Enshakushanna and Lugal-Zaggesi. According to the Bible (Genesis 10:10), it was one of the cities started by Nimrod. Also, in the early Sumerian legend called "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta", the countries where the languages were scattered are said to be: Shubar (Subartu), Hamazi, the Mar.tu (Amorites) land, Sumer, and Uri-Ki (Akkad), again showing the place is very old. Also, in the earliest records, when Mesopotamian kings started calling themselves "lord of the four quarters" around Sumer, these were listed as: Martu, Shubar, Elam, and Uri-ki.
As the capital city of the Akkadian Empire beginning with Sargon, the city ruled from around 2300 to 2215 BC, when it was destroyed by the Gutians who invaded from the mountains. The Akkadian language was one of the Semitic languages, and at the time of the Akkadian Empire it was made official in both Mesopotamia and Elam.
Later to reclaim the land General Paynis Ahkhad invaded, and claimed the land under the people of Tell-Ahkm
