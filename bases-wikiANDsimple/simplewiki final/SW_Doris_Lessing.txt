Doris Lessing (born as Doris May Tayler, on 22 October, 1919 in Kermanshah, Iran) is a British writer. In 2007, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. Reporters told Doris that she had won the Nobel prize and they asked her "Are you not surprised?". She said she had already "won every other European literature prize" so winning prizes was normal.
