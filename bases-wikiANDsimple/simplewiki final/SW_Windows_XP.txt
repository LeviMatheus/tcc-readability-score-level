Versions.
There are two common versions of Windows XP. Windows XP Home Edition is a version made for home users. Windows XP Professional is made for business users, with advanced management features. In addition, Windows XP Media Center Edition is for people who edit videos and pictures a lot. Another special version of XP is called the Tablet PC Edition, for touch screen/tablet computers.
A version of Windows XP for 64-bit computers was released as Windows XP x64 Edition. It had all the features of Windows XP Professional, but was made to work on 64-bit computers instead of the older 32-bit computers.
There is also a Windows XP Starter Edition, which is sold mostly in developing countries. It is very cheap, because Microsoft wanted to fight the high software piracy rate in those countries. It is very limited and can only be bought with a new computer.
