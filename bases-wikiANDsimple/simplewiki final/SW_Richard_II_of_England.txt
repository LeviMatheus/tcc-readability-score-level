Richard II (January 6 1367 â€“ February 14 1400) was the son of Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales, and Joan "The Fair Maid of Kent". He was born in Bordeaux and became his father's successor when his elder brother died in infancy. His father died before him, so he became king in 1377. Towards the end of his reign, Richard became a tyrant, and was removed from the throne in 1399. He died the next year.
