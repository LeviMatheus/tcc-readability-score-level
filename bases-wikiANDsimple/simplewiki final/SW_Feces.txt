Feces or f√¶ces/faeces (pronounced in IPA:} is the body's solid waste left over from eating food. Feces exits the body through the anus. Feces can also be used to created fertiliser for plant crops. Some feces is also used as a fuel for cookery.
Coprophagia is the practice of eating feces. This is unusual to most species, but some animals especially plant eaters with a high-fibre/low-protein diet (such as rabbits) eat their own feces as a normal part of their diet. It's not just animals that eat their own feces. Some humans do too, but this is not advised because several diseases and parasites can be spread through eating human faeces.
