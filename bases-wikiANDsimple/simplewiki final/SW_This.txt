This is a demonstrative pronoun used to identify a noun. It describes something that is here or nearby ("This ball I am holding is red." or "This is my home."). A very easy way to tell if someone is using this the right way is if the object that they are talking about can be pointed to. For example, if someone says "this computer is mine," it should be possible to point to the computer. It does not matter if the computer (a noun) is in the room or in a picture.
