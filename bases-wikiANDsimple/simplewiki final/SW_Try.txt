A Try is one of the way of scoring points in rugby league and rugby union. A try is scored when a player grounds the ball in the opposition's in-goal area or behind the try line, or alternatively touching the base of the goalposts and ground at the same time. The scoring player must be holding on to the ball and should be applying downward pressure when it is grounded.
