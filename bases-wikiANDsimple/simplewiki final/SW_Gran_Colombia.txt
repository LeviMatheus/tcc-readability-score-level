Gran Colombia was a country that was created by Simon Bolivar. It had three countries together: Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, and Simon Bolivar was its president. It can be said that he was the first president of all of those counties. Gran Colombia was made because it was Bolivar's dream, but it did not last a long time, because most people thought that it would not work.
