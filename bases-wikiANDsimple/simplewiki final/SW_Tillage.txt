Tillage is the process in which soil is loosened and softened by tillers or harrows pulled by a tractor or by a plough pulled by an animal or human. By this process the upper crust of the soil breaks, air and sunlight thus penetrate the soil and in the process increasing its fertility but too much or frequent tillage may impair its fertility.
