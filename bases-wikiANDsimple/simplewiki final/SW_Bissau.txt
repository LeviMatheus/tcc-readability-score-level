Bissau is the capital city of Guinea-Bissau. It is also the largest city in the country; around 355,000 people live there. The city is where the Geba river flows into the Atlantic Ocean.
The city was built by the Portuguese in 1687. It became the capital of Portuguese Guinea in 1942, and has been the capital since independence was declared, except for a short time in 1973 and 1974 when the capital was at Boe. Bissau is famous for having a carnival every year.
The main things that come from here are peanuts, wood, coconut meat, palm oil, and rubber.
