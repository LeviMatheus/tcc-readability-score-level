Lemko-Rusyn Republic or Ruska Narodna Respublika Lemkiv was founded in Florynka on December 5, 1918, in the aftermath of World War I, after the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a Russophile organization, it originally had the intent of unification with a democratic Russia, and opposed union with the West Ukrainian National Republic. As union with Russia was not possible, it attempted to join with Carpathian Ruthenia on the southern slopes of the Carpathians as an autonomous province of Czechoslovakia. The republic was headed by the President of the Central National Council, Doctor Jaroslav Kacmarcyk. It was ended by the Polish government in March 1920. Its fate was sealed by the Peace of Riga later that year.
This state should be distinguished from the short-lived Komancza Republic of eastern Lemkivshchyna. This was a smaller, Ukrainiophile organization, lasting from November 1918 to January 23, 1919.
