434 Hungaria is a fairly small closer Main belt asteroid. It is classified as an E-type (high-albedo) asteroid. The Hungaria asteroids are named after this asteroid. The asteroids orbit the sun on the inside of the 1:4 Kirkwood gap, standing out of the core of the main belt.
It was found by Max Wolf on September 11, 1898 at the University of Heidelberg. It was named after an astronomical meeting which happened in Budapest also in 1898.
It is thought that there may be a genetic connection between 434 Hungaria and 3103 Eger and the aubrites.
