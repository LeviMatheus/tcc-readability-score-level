Nickel Creek is an American acoustic musical group. Although the group's music has roots in bluegrass, Nickel Creek now calls itself "progressive acoustic". The band has three people: Chris Thile (mandolin), Sean Watkins (guitar), and Sara Watkins (violin). A fourth member also plays bass with the band. Chris Thile's father Scott Thile, Byron House, and Derek Jones have played bass with the group. Mark Schatz has played bass with Nickel Creek since 2003. The band has played songs by Radiohead, Elliott Smith, Bob Dylan, and even "Toxic" by Britney Spears. However, most of the band's songs from recordings are originals.
The band started in California in 1989 with Scott Thile, Chris' father, playing bass. The oldest of the children, Sean Watkins, was only twelve years old at the time. In the early days, Nickel Creek made two albums: "Little Cowpoke" in 1993, and "Here to There" in 1997.
Alison Krauss produced "Nickel Creek", which came out in 2000 on Sugar Hill Records. It was made gold in 2002 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Two other albums have been released: "This Side" (2002), and "Why Should the Fire Die?" (2005).
