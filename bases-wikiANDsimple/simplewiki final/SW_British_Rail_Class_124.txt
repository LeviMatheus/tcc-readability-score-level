The British Rail Class 124 was a class of initially six-car Diesel Multiple Units used and built specifically for the trans-pennine route. They were progressively shortened during their lifetime, finally finishing as three-car sets. They were all withdrawn by the late 1980s. There was a movement to preserve a set of this class, however it was unsuccessful and eventually all were lost.
