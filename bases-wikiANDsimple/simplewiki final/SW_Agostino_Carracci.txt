Agostino Carracci (sometimes also spelled Agostino Caracci, August 16, 1557 - March 22, 1602) was an Italian painter and printmaker. His brother Annibale and cousin of Lodovico Carracci were more famous than he was.
He thought nature was an ideal. He founded a school that was competing with that of Caravaggio. Together with his brothers, he founded the Accademia degli Incamminati. The academia helped painters of the School of Bologna to become famous.
