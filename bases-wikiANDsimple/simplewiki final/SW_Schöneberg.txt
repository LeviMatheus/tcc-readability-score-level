Schöneberg is a locality of Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a separate borough including the locality of Friedenau. Together with the former borough of Tempelhof it is now part of the new borough of Tempelhof-Schöneberg.
History.
The village was first documented in 1264 by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751 Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Schöneberg also known as Böhmisch-Schöneberg, along the current Hauptstraße.
During the Seven Years' War on 7 October 1760 Schöneberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Austrian and Russian troops.
Alt & Neu Schöneberg were combined as one entity in 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In 1920 Schöneberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Its town hall Rathaus Schöneberg was completed in 1914. Subsequent to World War II it served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte.
