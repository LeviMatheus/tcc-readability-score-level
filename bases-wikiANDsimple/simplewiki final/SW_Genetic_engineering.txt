Genetic engineering'", or GE, is a branch of biology. It focuses on making food, animals and plants better adapted to the need of humans. It does this by tweaking genes. Some people see a problem in this.
There is a risk that some genetically modified ("GM") organism is better adapted to some niche in nature, and will take away some space of another organism. It could also be that some of the genetic modifications "leak" into unengineered plants. Many people do not think so, however. They feel the risks do not outweigh the benefits of GE.
Common genetic modifications are that some plants produce pesticides and fungicides themselves, or that they spoil only later on. Genetic engineering is also used to clone animals.
The process of genetic engineering is a common topic of debate among scientists and scholars alike.
