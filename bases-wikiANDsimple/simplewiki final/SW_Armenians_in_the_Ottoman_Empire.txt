The Ottoman rule of Armenia or Ottoman Armenia begins with the initial accession of Mehmed II, but it was during the rule of Selim II (1524 – 1574) that Armenia become an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. This condition ended after 300 years when following the Russo–Turkish War (1828–1829), Eastern Armenia was ceded to the Russian Empire. Western Armenia remained under Ottoman rule until the Ottoman Empire itself fell in World War I.
On April 24, 1915, Armenian intellectuals were arrested by Ottoman authorities and, with the Tehcir Law (29 May 1915), eventually a large proportion of Armenians living in Anatolia perished in what has become known as the Armenian Genocide.
