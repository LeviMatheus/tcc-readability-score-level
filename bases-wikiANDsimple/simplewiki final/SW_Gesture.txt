A Gesture is a form of communication. Unlike "verbal communication", which uses words, gestures use movements of the body. This form of communication is very rich in meaning. A lot of gestures are done unconsciously, to express various feelings, or states of mind. Many animals communicate extensively using gestures. The dog, who has been a companion to humans for a very long time, is very good at reading gestures.
What is more, gestures have a cultural significance (meaning). The same gesture can mean different things in different cultures and different parts of the world.
