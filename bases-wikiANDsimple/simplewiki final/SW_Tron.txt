"Tron" is a 1982 Walt Disney Productions science fiction movie starring Jeff Bridges as Kevin Flynn (and Clu), Bruce Boxleitner as Alan Bradley (and Tron) and Cindy Morgan as Lora (and Yori). David Warner plays the villain, Dillinger (and Sark, as well as the voice of the "Master Control Program"). It was directed by Steven Lisberger. One of the first movies to use computer graphics extensively, "Tron" has a distinctive visual style.
The music for the movie was written by Wendy Carlos, and there were also two songs from the band Journey.
In spite of mixed success upon its debut, "Tron" has recently gained a cult following thanks to its CGI and plot line. Several video games have been based on it.
A twentieth anniversary DVD edition came out in 2002. In early 2005, Disney revealed plans for an Internet-centered remake.
