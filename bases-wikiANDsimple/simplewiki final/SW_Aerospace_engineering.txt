Aerospace engineering is the word used for work of vehicles in the air or space. This usually means working with airplanes, helicopters and spacecrafts.
To work in Aerospace Engineering you must train. This is done depending on what you want to do. Aerospace Engineers (those who design and oversee repair of vehicles) study at a university or college and must earn a degree. Technicians (those who repair and construct vehicles) will do a shorter course and 'on the job' training. Aerospace jobs include astronauts, pilots, and other things.
