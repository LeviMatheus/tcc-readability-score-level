A social worker is a government employee that helps people who cannot help themselves including phisically disabled people, people addicted to alcohol, and people with addictions to drugs like cocaine and marijuana. This person helps the disadvantaged person acquire a normal life (job, home, money, etc.)If a child is being abused then a social worker could help by either taking the child away to live in a home or to be fostered. Social workers are provided by the government. They also are on simulation games such as the Sims 2 where if you had a baby and a child and the child had lack of food or social, the social worker would trun up and take both of them away because they think that your not looking after the baby.
