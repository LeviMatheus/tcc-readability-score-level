ASCII is a binary code used by computers, communications equipment, and other devices to handle text using the English alphabet. ASCII is an abbreviation for "American Standard Code for Information Interchange".
ASCII was developed in the 1960s and was based on earlier codes used by telegraph systems.
ASCII includes definitions for 128 characters: most of these are the printable characters of the alphabet such as abc, ABC, 123, and ?&!. The rest of the characters within the code do not actually print but instead control how text is processed, for example line endings.
ASCII uses 7 binary digits to represent characters: 1000001 represents the upper-case letter A; 1000010 represents B; 1000011 represents C; and so on in sequence.
The name ASCII is often used for binary codes that use all values in a full byte (8 binary digits). It is not really correct to call them ASCII, since ASCII is only the method described here above. Often they are called extended ASCII. Such binary codes can have definitions for 256 characters. The first 128 characters must be the same as for ASCII and the rest are usually used for alphabetic letters with accents, for example like É, È, Î and Ü. Such characters are needed to correctly write languages other than English, for example French, German and Swedish.
