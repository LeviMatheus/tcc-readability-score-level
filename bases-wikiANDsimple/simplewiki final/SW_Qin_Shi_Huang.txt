Qin Shi Huang, also known as Qin Shi Huangdi was the first emperor to unite, or bring together, all of China. He lived from 259 BC - September 10, 210 BC. He was king of the Chinese State of Qin from 247 BC - 221 BC (that was officially under the rule of the Zhou Dynasty). He founded the short-lived Qin Dynasty, which was the first Chinese kingdom. Its official name was the State of Qin and his official title was "The First Emperor of the State of Qin".
He introduced, or brought in, legalism. He and his advisor (or helper) Li Si started a lot of reforms at bringing China together politically. They had a lot of huge projects, including the Great Wall of China, a city-sized mausoleum guarded by a life-sized Terracotta army, and a system of roads that went all over the nation. He outlawed Confucianism. He burned the scholars alive and destroyed the books.
Despite his cruel rule as emperor, Qin Shi Huang is still seen as an important person in Chinese history because his unification, or bringing together, of China lasted for over two millienia, or 2,000 years.
