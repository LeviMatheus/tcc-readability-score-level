The Pharos of Alexandria (Greek: o Φάρος της Αλεξάνδρειας) was a tall tower built in the 3rd century BC (between 285 and 247 BC). It was built on the island of Pharos in Alexandria, Egypt to serve as the port's landmark, and later, its lighthouse.
With a height estimated at between 115 and 145 meters (384 - 469 ft) it was among the tallest man-made structures on Earth for many centuries. It was identified as one of the Seven Wonders of the World by Antipater of Sidon. It was the third tallest building after the two Great Pyramids (of Khufu and Khafra). Some scholars estimate a much taller height over 180 meters that would make the tower the tallest building up to the 14th century.
