Aldous Leonard Huxley (born July 26, 1894, died November 22, 1963) was a British writer of the first half of the 20th century. He wrote a great number of books, on various themes. Most of his books are either highly philosophical, or they try to criticize modern science. Aldous Huxley is probably best known for his book "Brave New World". In the book, which was written in 1932, he shows what can go wrong with genetic engineering. He writes about a world in the far future, where the whole social hierarchy is based on genetic traits, and not on the personal effort of the individual people to learn and improve themselves. Such a position is often called eugenics.
