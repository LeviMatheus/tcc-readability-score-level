Gluten is a composite of the proteins "gliadin" and "glutenin". These are, together with starch, in the endosperms of some grass-related grains, such as wheat, rye, and barley. Gliadin and glutenin make up for about 80% of the protein contained in wheat seed. As they are insoluble in water, they can be got by washing away the associated starch. Worldwide, gluten is an important source of nutritional protein, in foods that are prepared directly from foods containing it, and as an additive to foods otherwise low in protein.
