Kalasha, also spelled as Kalash (Sanskrit:, "kala≈õa"; literally "pitcher, pot"), is a metal (brass, copper, silver or gold) pot with a large base and small mouth, large enough to hold a coconut. Sometimes "Kalasha" can mean a pot filled with water and topped with a coronet of mango leaves and a coconut. This combination is often used in Hindu rites.
