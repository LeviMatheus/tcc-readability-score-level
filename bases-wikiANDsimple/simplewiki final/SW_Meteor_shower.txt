A meteor shower is when pieces of rock and dust burn in the Earth's atmosphere.
Many objects in space cross the Earth's orbit from time to time, such as comets and rocks. When the Earth passes through the dust and pieces left behind by these rocks, they are attracted by the Earth's gravity and eventually burn in the Earth's atmosphere. When a lot of particles enter the atmosphere at the same time, we see a shower-like effect.
