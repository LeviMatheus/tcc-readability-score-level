A shell is the metal case that holds a bullet. Usually shells are made of brass, but steel shells are being used more now. Shells are usually filled with gunpowder and have a bullet inserted into them.
Shells can be loaded into magazines to be fired out of guns, or they can be hand-loaded into the gun.
