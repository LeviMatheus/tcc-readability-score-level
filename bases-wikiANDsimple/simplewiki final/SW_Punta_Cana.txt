Punta Cana, named after a local cape, is a region in the easternmost tip of the Dominican Republic. Covering about 4,200,000 m2 (about 1,100 acres), the region is home to a coastline of sandy white beaches and to a town of the same name. A region once named "Punta de Borrach√≥n" was merged with Punta Cana by the founding investors in 1969.
