Ancient history is history from when human history began until the early Middle Ages or the end of the Roman Empire in about 476 AD. The word "antiquity" usually means ancient history that is before the start of Ancient Greek history in about 776 BC. Ancient Rome also began at about this time.
Study of ancient history.
Finding facts about ancient history is difficult because people wrote less in those times and some of what they did write has been lost. Not many people could read and write in ancient history so people did not write about history then. There were very small numbers of copies made because there was no printing press. What people wrote they wrote by hand. More people could read and write in Ancient Rome than in other places but much of what they wrote is now lost. Historians look at things that were made and used in ancient history to learn more about it.
Archaeology.
Archaeology is looking at things that were made or used in the past to find out more about that time. Things like clay pots, solid tools, and metal weapons can stay the same during a long time. Things like paper, wood, and cloth can be easily broken or damaged.
Primary sources.
These are things written by people who lived in ancient history. They tell us most of what we know about ancient history. But people in ancient history may have believed different things from each other. They may also be wrong.
