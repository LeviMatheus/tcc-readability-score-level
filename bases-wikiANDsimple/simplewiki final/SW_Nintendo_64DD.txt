The Nintendo 64DD was a sub-CD add on for the Nintendo 64. It was considered too late in the Fifth Generation and flopped on its release in Japan in 1999. When it came out the Dreamcast had already been released and soon for Nintendo fans the GameCube was developed with a build in CD drive. For these reasons it flopped and few games were ever released.
