A swamp is part of a wetland ecosystem. Swamps are forested low, spongy land generally saturated with water and covered with trees and aquatic vegetation. Big parts of swamps are often flooded with water. Swamps are nesting and breeding grounds for birds and other animals.
About 6 percent of the earth's surface is covered by swamps. Swamps are also filters for groundwater, and protect against flooding.
