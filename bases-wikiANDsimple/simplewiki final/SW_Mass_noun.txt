In linguistics, a mass noun (also uncountable noun or non-count noun) is a common noun that means it does not or may not end. Some cannot be described by a numeral without specifying a unit of measurement or an "a" or "an". For example, the mass noun "water" does not say how much water there is but "20 liters of water" does.
