History.
The beginning of Omega was 1848 in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Louis Brandt opened a factory, that produces watches. The watches made there, carried the name Louis Brandt. After the death of Brandt, his sons transfered the production to Bienne (Switzerland). There, they started to produce their watches industrially. Already in 1898 "Louis Brandt & fr√®res" employed more than 500 workers.
1894 they changed their name into Omega, when they released a whatch, named Omega. This name should show the quality of that watch, because Omega is the last letter of the greek alphabet and means "perfection".
In 1904 finally, the Brandt brothers died, and the company came into the hands of their children. In the following years, Omega became a highly prestigious watch manufacturer. In 1925 Omega started to work with Tissot, another watch manufacturer.
Today Omega belongs to the Swatch Group.
