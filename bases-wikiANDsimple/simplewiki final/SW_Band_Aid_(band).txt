Band Aid was a British and Irish charity supergroup. It was founded in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. The purpose was to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia by releasing the record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" The single was very successful. It was #1 on the music charts during Christmas. Two re-recordings of the song were done. They raised more money and also finished #1 on the charts.
Band Aid II re-recorded the song in 1989, and Band Aid 20 did the same in 2004.
