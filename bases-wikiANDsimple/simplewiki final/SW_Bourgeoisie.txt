Bourgeoisie means a social class of people who are in the upper or merchant class. Their status or power comes from employment, education, and wealth and not from aristocratic origin.
The term is widely used in many non-English speaking countries as an approximate equivalent of middle class.
Bourgeoisie is a French word that was borrowed directly into English in the sense that is explained above.
The French word "bourgeois" comes from the Old French word "burgeis", meaning "an inhabitant of a town" (cf. Middle English "burgeis", Middle Dutch "burgher" and German "BÃ¼rger"). The Old French word "burgeis" comes from "bourg", meaning a market town or medieval village, itself derived from Late Latin "burgus", meaning "fortress"
