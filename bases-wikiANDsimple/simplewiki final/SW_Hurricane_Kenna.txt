Hurricane Kenna was a destructive hurricane of the 2002 Pacific hurricane season. It was one of the strongest Pacific hurricanes to ever strike Mexico.
Kenna formed in the eastern Pacific on October 22. It strengthened rapidly, reaching category five on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on October 25. Hurricane Kenna weakened to category four before striking land near Puerto Vallarta later that day. The only Pacific hurricanes to strike Mexico at greater intensity were 1976's Hurricane Madeline and an unnamed 1959 storm.
Officials reported four deaths from Hurricane Kenna.
