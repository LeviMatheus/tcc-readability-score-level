Phengodidae is a family of beetles. They are known as "glowworm beetles" or "glowworms". They occur only in the New World. The females and larvae have organs that can produce light. There are about 30 genera in this family.
The larvae and the females (which keep their larval form) ate predators. They feed on millipedes and other animals they find in the soil and litter. Males are winged. They are attracted to lights at night. They are probably short-lived and do not feed at all. In some species, adult males can also produce light. Females have organs that produce a green or yellow light on their trunks. Some of them (called railroad worms) also have such an organ in front, which can produce a red light.
The family is different from the Fireflies (Lampyrideae), which may also be called "glow-worms"when they are larvae.
