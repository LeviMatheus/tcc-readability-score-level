In the context of Russian Orthodox church history, the Old Believers () became separated after 1666 - 1667. They split from the hierarchy of the Russian Orthodox Church as a protest against church reforms introduced by Patriarch Nikon. Old Believers continue liturgical practices which the Russian Orthodox Church maintained before the implementation of these reforms.
Russian-speakers refer to the schism itself as "raskol" (раскол - etymologically indicating a "cleaving-apart").
