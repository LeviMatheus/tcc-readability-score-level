"Mother 1 + 2" is a video game on the Nintendo Game Boy Advance which includes "Mother" and "Mother 2" ("EarthBound" US). It is not known if it will be made into English and sold in the United States, though it looks unlikely Many of the music is different than the console games ("Mother 2" is mostly the same, but "Mother" was changed a lot to make it similar to the United States one that was not sold).
