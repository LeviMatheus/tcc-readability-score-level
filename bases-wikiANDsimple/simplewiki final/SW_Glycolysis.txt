Glycolysis is the archetype of all metabolic processes known. Therefore one can find it in many types of cells in nearly all organisms.
The reason is that it is the foundation of both aerobic and anaerobic respiration.
Glycolysis, through anaerobic respiration, is the main energy source in many cells.
Alternative nomenclature.
Some of the metabolites in glycolysis have alternative names and nomenclature. In part, this is because some of them are common to other pathways, such as the Calvin cycle.
