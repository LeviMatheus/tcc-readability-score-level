The United States Presidential line of succession is based on laws that says the order of who replaces the United States President if he leaves office before his term is over. If President dies, quits, or is removed from office before his term ends, the Vice President will become President until the end of the President's term. If the Vice President cannot do it or if there is no Vice President, the next person in the line of succession becomes the new President. As of 2008, only Vice Presidents have succeeded the President.
Prior Lines of Succession.
The laws about succession were first created in 1792. The second in line, behind the Vice President, was the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, followed by Speaker of the House of Representatives. In 1868, during the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, President pro tempore Benjamin Wade nearly became new president but Johnson was found not guilty by one vote. Johnson, who became President after the death of Abraham Lincoln, had no Vice President. The Chief Justice and other members of the Supreme Court were excluded from the line of succession.
In 1886, after death of Vice President Thomas Hendricks, Congress passed a new law which removed the President pro tempore and the Speaker from line. The new person in line behind Vice President was Secretary of State, followed by other Cabinet members.
Current Line of Succession.
Other cabinet-level officials (Chief of the White House Staff, Ambassador to the United Nations) are not included. Their offices are not in line for succession.
