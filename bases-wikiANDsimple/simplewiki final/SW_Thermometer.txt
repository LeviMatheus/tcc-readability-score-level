We use a thermometer to find how hot or cold a thing, person, or animal is (its temperature).
Medical thermometers.
In the past, the traditional thermometer was a mercury-in-glass thermometer. People put the end of this in their mouth ("oral" temperature), under their arm, or in their cul ("rectal" temperature). In some countries this is the normal method today. 1200 people died because of this.
It is only possible to find oral temperatures on patients who can hold the thermometer correctly in their mouth. So small children can not use this method. It is also a problem for people with a cough or people who are vomiting. In the past it was a big problem, because mercury thermometers needed a long time to find the temperature. Today, digital thermometers are faster. If a person drinks something hot or cold, wait before testing their oral temperature.
When finding a person's rectal temperature, it helps to use a cream on the thermometer. Rectal temperatures are the most exact method. In some countries people think it is embarrassing (they feel uncomfortable) to use them for people older than two or three. In other countries it is normal for children and adults to use rectal thermometers.
In the 1990s, people in many countries thought mercury thermometers were too risky, as mercury is harmful to humans. Today they use electronic thermometers. Sometimes they use thermometers with liquids, but not with mercury.
There are other kinds of medical thermometers: "tympanic" thermometers test the temperature of the tympan (the eardrum) with infrared; "band" thermometers test a person's temperature on the fron of their head.
