Bleach is a liquid that is used as a cleaner. It also can cause things to turn white or pale. Bleach can harm people's skin if they do not use it carefully.
Dangers of using bleach.
Mixing bleach with some things commonly found at home, like vinegar or even fruit juice can produce chemicals like Chlorine that are irritating or even dangerous. Bleach should also not be mixed with ammonia, because a dangerous chemical reaction will occur. This reaction can kill people.
Certain types of bleaches produce toxic waste. Some of them produce dioxins.
Other uses.
Bleach is also used to make hair lighter in color, orange, blonde, or even white. It is often used by dark-haired people to make highlights, and most light hair dyes contain it.
In the textile dye and finish industry, sodium hydrochlorite is available in powder form. It is usually used to strip color from dyed polyester fabrics in order to re dye the fabric. I also find it useful in a final dye stage to clear any excess dye from the polyester fabric. Use a final scour at 60C or 140 F. Use 5% active bleach on the weight of the goods. Drop the final scour bath after bleaching and rinse with clean water at 60C or 140 F. The polyester fabric will pass the 2A wash fastness test even on deep shades.
