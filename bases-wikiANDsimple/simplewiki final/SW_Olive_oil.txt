Olive oil is a vegetable oil. It is made by getting the juice of the fruits of the olive tree. These are called olives. The oil is used in cooking, as well as beauty products (cosmetics), traditional medicine, and as a fuel for oil lamps.
People see it as a healthy addition to their diet because of the high level of unsaturated fats (mainly oleic acid) and polyphenols.
