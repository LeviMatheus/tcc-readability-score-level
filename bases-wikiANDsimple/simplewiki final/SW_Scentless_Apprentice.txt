"Scentless Apprentice" is a song by the American grunge band, Nirvana. It was on their third album, "In Utero", and a live version was on their live album, "From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah". Most of their songs were only written by the singer Kurt Cobain, but this song was written by all three members of the band.
The song was written in 1992. The band originally did not like the song, because it was too much of a generic grunge song, however they soon began to like it. They even thought of releasing it as the second single from "In Utero" (after "Heart-Shaped Box") but this never happened.
The song is about a book that Kurt Cobain read, "Perfume". The book and the song are about a boy who is born without body odor but has a strong sense of smell. Soon he becomes a murderer who kills female victims.
In the TV Show "Lost", Scentless Apprentice is playing on one of the characters' car radios. See this.
