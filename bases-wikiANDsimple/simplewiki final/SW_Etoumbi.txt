Etoumbi is a town in a part of the Republic of the Congo called Cuvette-Ouest.
Recently, there were four outbreaks of the Ebola virus in Etoumbi. Some people think this is because the people that live there ate some dead animals from the forest. In 2003, 120 people died in an outbreak. Because of an outbreak in May, 2005 nobody was allowed in or out of the town.
