When a beam of light shines onto something, that thing will cast a dark image of itself onto the ground or another surface. This image is usually called shadow. A place where the sun does not reach when it is shining can also be called "shade".
To make a shadow, there must be a light source, and an object to shine the light at. As light travels in straight lines, it cannot reach the shadow area without bending around the object. This makes the shadow. A shadow is not completely black though, as some light reflects off other objects to reach the shadow area.
