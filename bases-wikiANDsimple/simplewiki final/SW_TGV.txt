The TGV (Train Ã  Grande Vitesse, French for "high-speed train"), is a category of high speed trains. They are used in France. They are also used for some travel between France and England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Switzerland. The trains normally travel at speeds between 270 km/h and 320 km/h. They are the fastest normal trains in the world, reaching 574,8 km/h in 2008.
Inside France, there are the following (high speed) lines
Lines to Spain and Italy are being planned. A High speed line to Germany is being built.
The building of the network has made travel times much shorter. Paris to Marseille (750km) can now be done in 3 hours. Two thirds of the traffic volume is done by the TGV, only one third is done by airplanes.
