Tissue means a part of an organ or organism. Tissues are groups of cells that work together. The cells look the same or almost the same. The work the cells do is also the same or almost the same.
Tissue is different from organ. Organs are made up of more than one kind of tissue. The heart is an organ. It is made up of different tissues. It has muscle tissue. It has connective tissue like the endocardium. The endocardium is the thin layer of tissue that lines the heart. The heart has valves that make sure the blood only goes forward through the heart. So the heart is an organ made from different tissues.
The study of the structure of tissues under a microscope is called histology.
