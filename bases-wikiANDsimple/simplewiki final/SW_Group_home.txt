A group home is a private house that serves as a non-secure home for unrelated people who share a common characteristic. In the United States, the term most often refers to homes for people who need social assistance or who are not able to live alone or without proper supervision. Before the 1970s, this function was served by institutions, asylums, poorhouses, orphanages and Victorian colonies.
People who live in a group home may be recovering drug addicts, developmentally disabled, abused or neglected youths, and/or young people with criminal records. A group home is different from a halfway house because it is not restricted to recovering addicts or convicted criminals, and also because the people who live there usually are asked or made to help maintain the household by doing chores or helping to manage a budget. In most countries, people can still vote and attend university while in a group home.
There are typically from 3 to 16 residents, as well as a resident manager or service staff. Residents may have their own room or share rooms, and share facilities such as laundry, bathroom, kitchen and common living areas. The opening of group homes in neighborhoods is occasionally opposed by residents, who fear that it will lead to a rise in crime and/or a drop in property values.
A group home can also refer to family homes in which children and youth of the foster care system are placed until foster families are found for them.
