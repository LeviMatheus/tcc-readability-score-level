A wormhole is a shortcut through time and space. It is not known if wormholes really exist. Scientists believe that if they existed they could be created by black holes. In order to hold open a wormhole, a form of negative energy, the opposite to gravity, would be needed, otherwise the wormhole would simply disappear very quickly after its creation. Wormholes also have black holes in them. The wormhole has a 2d spot and it folds and anything that goes through is warped to the other side. (as seen in the picture) The term wormhole was first used by John Wheeler, a theoretical physicist.
