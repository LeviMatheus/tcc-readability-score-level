Google is one of the biggest and most famous websites for finding things (Search Engine) on the World Wide Web (WWW). They also do things apart from searching. Other search engines (for example, AOL) use its software and information (database) too. That makes it the most-used search engine on the web. Every day, 200 million people use it. That is 200 000 000 people. Google's main office ("Googleplex") is in Mountain View, California, USA.
With Google, people can also search for pictures, Usenet newsgroups, news, and things to buy online. By June 2004, Google indexed (or put in its database) 4.28 billion webpages, 880 million (880 000 000) pictures and 845 million (845 000 000) Usenet messages â€” six billion things.
"To google," as a doing word (verb) means "to search for something on Google"; because Google is so popular (over 50% of web users use it) it has been used to mean "to search the web". Google dislikes this use since Google is a trademark and Google can lose that trademark if people use it too widely.
History.
Google began as a project in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at Leland Stanford University, USA. They made it into a company, Google Inc., on September 7, 1998 at a friend's garage in Menlo Park, California. In February 1999, the company went to 165 University Ave., Palo Alto, California. Then, later that year, it went to another place, now called the "Googleplex".
In September 2001, Google's rating system ("PageRank", for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S. Patent. The patent was to Leland Stanford University, with Lawrence Page as the inventor (the person who first had the idea).
Google makes a significant, though getting less (declining), percentage of it's money through its friends like America Online and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make contracts, help making accounts better, and
The name "Google".
The name "Google" is a misspelling on the word "googol". Milton Sirotta, nephew of U.S. mathematician Edward Kasner, made this word in 1938, for the number 1 and one hundred 0's. It is said that the word "googol" was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk. Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim first thought of the name.(1 googol is 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000)
The name for Google's main office, the "Googleplex," (Very big Number) is a play on a different, even bigger number, "googolplex", which is 1 with 1 googol of 0's.
