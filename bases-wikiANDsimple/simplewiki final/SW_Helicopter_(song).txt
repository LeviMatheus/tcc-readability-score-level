"Helicopter" is a song by British band Bloc Party. It was written by all band members for their album, Silent Alarm. The song uses a punk rock-style, built up with many different parts, and the tempo is faster than other Bloc Party songs. The idea behind the song has been debated, with lead singer Kele Okereke disagreeing with rumours a few times.
