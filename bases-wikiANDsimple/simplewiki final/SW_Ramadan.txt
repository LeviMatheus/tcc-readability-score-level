Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting. Just like the month of September in a Gregorian Calendar, this is the number nine month of the Hijri calendar.
It begins when Muslims can find the moon for the first time after a few nights. Then, Muslims should not eat or drink once the sun rises. They can only do that once the sun goes down. This usually continues for thirty days, but sometimes twenty-nine days.
It ends with Eid Al-Fitr, the time when Muslims break their fast. There are exceptions to this. Pregnant women, the sick, and children are usually excepted from this rule.
Ramadan is a time for Muslims to think about how the poor and homeless suffer without lots of food, it helps Muslims to be more obedient, and less greedy.
