The Wakker Prize (in German: "Wakkerpreis", in French "Prix Wakker") is given every year by the Swiss Heritage Society to a municipality of Switzerland for the making and saving of its historical buildings.
In 2005, the prize was given to the Swiss Federal Railways, rather than a municipality.
The prize is named for Henri-Louis Wakker.
