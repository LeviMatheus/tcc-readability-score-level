Stockwell Orphanage was an orphanage in Stockwell, London, England. It was founded in 1867 by Charles Spurgeon. The orphanage was created in what is now Stockwood Acres Estates. It opened on September 9 1869. The orphanage had places for 250 children to live. These children were fed, clothed, and taught at the orphanage. This all cost about Â£ 5,000 each year. The money to pay for this was mainly gotten from donations. The Orphanage was a home for boys without fathers between the ages of six and ten. Even though the orphanage was created by Baptists, boys of any religion were accepted there. In 1879, other buildings for children to live in were added to the orphanage. This allowed the orphanage to begin letting girls live there also.
The orphanage was open until London was bombed in World War II.
