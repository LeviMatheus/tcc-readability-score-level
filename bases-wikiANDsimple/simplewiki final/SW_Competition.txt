A competition or contest is an event where people get together to see who is the best at something. Someone who takes part in a competition ("enters for a competition") is called a competitor. The competitors compete against one another. The person who wins may get a prize. This may be a trophy or sometimes a money prize.
Competitions can be for all sorts of things: sport, writing, music, dancing, science, chess etc.
There will probably be a referee. The referee will make sure that the game is played fairly and that the competitors obey the rules. In things like music there will be an adjudicator who will decide which person they think is the best.
