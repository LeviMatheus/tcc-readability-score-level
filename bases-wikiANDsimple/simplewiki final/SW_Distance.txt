Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a measure of the space between two things.
Displacement.
Distance is different from displacement. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point.
Example of Displacement.
A and B are 1 metre apart. Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres. Tom's displacement is 0 metres, because Tom started at A and finished at A.
