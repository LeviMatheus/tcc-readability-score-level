In boxing, the term heavyweight is used for a specific group of people based on weight. A heavyweight is a boxer who weighs more than 201 lbs.
At 200 pounds and below is cruiserweight. Boxing organizations created many divisions so that fighters could fight people of the same size.
The first heavyweight champion under modern rules was John L. Sullivan. Famous heavyweight champions have included Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield, and Lennox Lewis.
