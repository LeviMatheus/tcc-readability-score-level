The Commonwealth is a name for some countries which were part of the British Empire before they became independent. This group of states works together on many important matters, like business, health and the fight against poverty.
The Commonwealth of Nations is a group of countries. Originally, it was called the British Commonwealth of Nations which was founded in 1926 when the British Empire began to break-up. Now, there are 53 member countries of the Commonwealth of Nations. All except Mozambique were part of the British Empire. There are some other associations having similar sounding names. For example, the Commonwealth of Australia or the Commonwealth of Independent states. But, the Commonwealth of Nations is different and a separate organization.
Origin.
The term the Commonwealth of Nations originated in 1884. Lord Rosebery was on a visit to Australia in 1884. At Adelaide he told that over a period of time a number of colonies of the British Empire will become free and many may become more independent. He further told that all of these countries would then become the Commonwealth of Nations. The use of the term continued, though in its present form and in a practical sense the Commonwealth of Nations originated decades later.
