}Eric Theodore Cartman is a character in the animated television series "South Park". He is voiced by series co-creator, Trey Parker.
Cartman is one of four main characters in the series. He is often the main reason for their adventures due to his over-enthusiasm and selfishness. Cartman often reacts violently to things that he hates. He hates any race or group of which he is not a member, particularly the Jews. This comes from his rivalry with Kyle Broflovski. Eric idolizes Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford (his dream car is a Model T), and Mel Gibson. He is also a fan of T.S. Elliot. He often manipulates others, at which he is good at, to meet his own ends, regardless of the consequences to other people, even if it can result in deaths and destruction.
