Matter is the substance or material of which all things are made. Matter has mass. Most matter has volume. All things we can touch, taste or smell are matter.
What is Matter Made of?
Matter is made of small particles, too small for the eye to see. Most common matter is made of particles called atoms. Atoms are made of even smaller particles called subatomic particles.
The matter in the sun and the matter high in the air in a place called the ionosphere is made of ions. Ions are pieces of atoms, or atoms with an extra piece.
Forms of Matter.
Liquids and gases are both special types of fluids. The difference between liquids and gases is that liquids can have an edge. The edge of a liquid is called a surface.
Water is an unusual substance. Water can be found as liquid, solid and gas naturally on the earth. This is not true of any other natural material.
Properties of Matter.
Matter has a property called mass. Energy (sound, light, heat) does not have mass.
Matter attracts other matter with a force called gravity. Light is not matter, but its movement is changed by gravity as though it was matter. Usually light acts as a wave, but in special cases light acts as a particle.
In the twentieth century, people found that matter can be changed into energy and energy can be changed into matter. Some matter is changed into energy in an atomic bomb.
Changing states of matter.
The state of matter can be changed from one state to another. There are several ways to change the state of matter. For example, changing the temperature of matter can change its state. Changing the volume of matter can change its state.
