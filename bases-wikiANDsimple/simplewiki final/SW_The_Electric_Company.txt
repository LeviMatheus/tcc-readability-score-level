"The Electric Company" was an educational American children's television series. It was produced by the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) for PBS in the United States. PBS broadcast 780 episodes over six seasons, from 1971 to 1977. CTW produced the show at Reeves Teletape Second Stage in Manhattan.
"The Electric Company" used sketch comedy and other devices to create an entertaining program to help children of elementary-school age get better at reading skills. It was meant for children who had "graduated" from CTW's main program, "Sesame Street."
