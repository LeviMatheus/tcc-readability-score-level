International Women's Day is celebrated every year on March 8. Many Communist countries like China, Cuba celebrate this day as a holiday for women. Usually women are given 1/2 day off work. This day is left as a holiday in former Soviet Republics for traditional reasons. Small gifts such as flowers are given to women by children, colleagues and family. Often, schools will have a celebration where students will honor their teachers.
International Women's Day has been observed since in the early 1900's, a time of great expansion and turbulence in the industrialized world that saw booming population growth and the rise of radical ideologies.
IWD is now an official holiday in Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Tajikistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Vietnam. The tradition sees men honouring their mothers, wives, girlfriends, colleagues, etc with flowers and small gifts. In some countries IWD has the equivalent status of Mother's Day where children give small presents to their mothers and grandmothers.
