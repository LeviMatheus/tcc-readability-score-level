A suit and tie is an ensemble (or outfit) of clothing which includes a dress shirt, a necktie, dress pants, a suit jacket (also called a "sports coat"), dress socks, leather dress shoes, and sometimes a vest. This outfit is worn in Western countries by men in professional jobs such as business, law, and politics.
The dress shirt is usually made of cotton or linen. A dress shirt has a stiff collar and it is ironed before it is worn. A necktie is usually made of silk or polyester, and it usually has a color or pattern on it. Dress pants are made of wool or polyester, and they are ironed before they are worn. A suit jacket (also called a "sports coat") is usually made of wool or polyester. Suit jackets have collar, pockets, and a silk or polyester lining. Dress socks are made of cotton or a mix of cotton and polyester. Dress socks are usually in a dark color such as black or dark blue. Leather dress shoes are usually made of dark-colored leather which is polished. Sometimes, people wearing a suit and tie will also wear a sleeveless vest with buttons in the front.
