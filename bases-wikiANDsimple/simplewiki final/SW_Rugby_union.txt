Rugby union is a ball sport. Two teams of 15 players play against each other. The ball used is oval in shape. The field is a rectangle shape. It is 100 meters long and 70 meters wide. It is played for 80 minutes (40 minutes aside). A Try is scored when a player scores or touches the ball down in the in-goal area and a try is worth 5 points and if its converted (the goal kicker kicks the ball in between the top of the goal post), the team gets an extra 2 points. Another method of scoring points is through Drop goals or penalty which are both worth 3 points each in union.
