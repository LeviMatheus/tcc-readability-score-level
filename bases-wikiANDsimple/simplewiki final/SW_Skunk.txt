A skunk is a mammal, usually black with a white stripe on its back and a fluffy tail. Its most special part is that can shoot out a bad-smelling spray from under its tail; it does this to ward off things that could hurt it.
It can eat both plants and small animals like earthworms, frogs, snakes, birds and eggs. It usually eats berries, leaves, grasses and nuts
The striped skunk is most well-known type of skunk. It weighs 2.5 to 14 pounds (1.2–6.3 kg) with a body length (without the tail) of 13 to 18 inches (33–46 cm). The tail is 7 to 10 inches long (18–25 cm), and sometimes has a white tip.
