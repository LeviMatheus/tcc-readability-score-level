Stenopterygius was a typical, dolphin-shaped ichthyosaur ("fish lizard") of the early Jurassic period. It's similar to the poster reptile of the ichthyosaur family. Ichthyosaurus, but with slightly narrower flippers (hence its name, which means "narrow wing") and a smaller head.
Like fish-like, Stenopterygius was more streamlined than earlier ichthyosaurs of the Triassic period, and likely swam much faster in pursuit of prey.
Some Stenopterygius fossils have been found with the remains of juveniles inside--clearly instances of mothers dying before they could give birth. As with other ichthyosaurs, it's now believed that Stenopterygius females gave birth to live young, rather than laying eggs like other reptiles.
