Iodine is a chemical element. Its atomic number (which is the number of protons in it) is 53, and its atomic mass is 127. It is part of the Group 7 (halogens) on the periodic table of elements.
Iodine is a nonmetal solid element. It has a purple color and reacts with other elements to form chemical compounds. It was discovered by Barnard Courtois in 1811 and was identified as an element in 1813.
Iodine is really important for our body. If we do not get enough of it, we get a disease known as goitre. When you buy salt from a store, iodine is sometimes added to make sure that we get enough. We can also take vitamins to make sure we get enough. There is a lot of iodine in the ocean, so some people get their iodine from seaweed.
