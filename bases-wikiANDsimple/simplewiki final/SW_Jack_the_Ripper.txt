Jack the Ripper is the name given to a serial killer, or a group of serial killers. They were active during the summer and fall of 1888 in the Whitechapel district of London, England.
Several other murders were reported around the time of these but were not believed to be the work of Jack the Ripper. Nobody knows who Jack the Ripper really was. Some think he might have been a doctor or a butcher because of how he cut and killed the women. Newspapers and police in London around this time started receiving taunting letters from someone who signed them Jack the Ripper.
All the murders happened in the year of 1888 and all the murders happened on weekends so it could have been a foreigner who only came for weekend visits.
