El Toro ("The Bull") is a wooden rollercoaster at Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, United States. It was opened (people could go on it) on June 11, 2006. It has the steepest drop of any wooden rollercoaster in the world, at 76 degrees. It is 188ft tall, a world record breaking drop on a wooden roller coaster, and goes at a maximum (highest possible) speed of 113km/h. The speed can be different. During the day it goes faster and faster. It begins at 108km/h and by the end of the day it travels at 118km/h. It has 4,400 feet of track, and the trains are known to not really slow down much through the whole ride. El Toro is also known for it's strong "airtime" (when riders would be thrown out of the seats if the restraints were not there).
Construction.
El Toro is quite different than most other wooden rollercoasters because it is made out prefabricated track, which means that the pieces of track were cut in a factory and do not need to be cut by hand. This makes the time to build El Toro much shorter. Since it uses prefabricated track, the ride is very smooth. Most wooden rollercoasters are known to be quite rough.
