In a witch hunt people searched for witches or evidence that witchcraft was done. In earlier times, people could be accused of witchcraft; they were then prosecuted, changed with it and punished for it. In the Catholic Church, punishment for witchcraft was death.
Today, most countries no longer allow a person to be charged with witchcraft; there are no more witch hunts in the strict sense.
When there still were, witch hunts often involved moral panic, mass hysteria and mob lynching. That way, priests would often make a bad feeling in the crowd; those who were a little different might then be seen as witches.
The time when there whic hunts were most common in Europe is during the Early Modern period from about 1480 to 1700. This is the time when there was the Protestant Reformation and the Thiry Years' War. During this time, tens of thousands of people were executed as witches.
Today, witch hunts still occur in many communities where religious values are strong, and where these values condemn whichcraft and other occult practices.
Today, the term "witch hunt" is mostly used to refer to similar practices, where panicked people search for wrong-doers, which are of course not witches. The best known example is probably the McCarthyist search for communists during the Cold War, which was discredited partly through being compared to the Salem witch trials.
