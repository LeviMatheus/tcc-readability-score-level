Cupid is a closer moon to Uranus. It was found by Mark Showalter and Jack J. Lissauer in 2003 using the Hubble Space Telescope. It was named after a character in William Shakespeare's play "Timon of Athens".
It is the smallest of the closer Uranian moons, estimated to be only about 18 km in diameter. This and the dark surface made it too dim to be detected by the "Voyager 2" cameras during its Uranus flyby in 1986.
The orbit of Cupid is only 863 km from the orbit of the bigger moon Belinda. Amazingly, compared to Mab and Perdita, the recently found Uranian moons, it does not seem to be perturbed.
Following its discovery, Cupid was given the designation S/2003 U 2. It is also designated Uranus XXVII.
It should not be confused with the asteroid 763 Cupido.
