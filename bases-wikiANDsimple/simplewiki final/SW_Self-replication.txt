Self-replication is any process by which a thing might make a copy of itself. Biological cells, in suitable environments, reproduce by cell division. During cell division, DNA is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during reproduction.
Biological viruses can reproduce, but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Computer viruses reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers.
Memes reproduce using the human mind and culture as their reproductive machinery.
