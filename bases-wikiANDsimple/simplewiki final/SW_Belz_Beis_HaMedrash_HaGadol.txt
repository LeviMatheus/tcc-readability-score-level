The Belz Beis HaMedrash HaGadol (in Yiddish: בעלזא בית המדרש הגדול - "The Belz Grand Synagogue) is the largest synagogue in Jerusalem. It was built by the Belz Hasidic Jews, with help from their supporters and admirers around the world. In the 1980s, Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach (II) of Belz made plans for the huge synagogue to be built in the Kiryat Belz part of Jerusalem.
