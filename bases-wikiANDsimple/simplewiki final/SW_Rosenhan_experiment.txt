The Rosenhan experiment is a test in psychiatry. It wants to see how good a psychiatric diagnosis really is. The first person to do the test was David Rosenhan. The test is named after him. It was first conducted in 1972.
The test is made of two parts. In first part, psychically sane people said they saw hallucinations, to get admitted to a psychiatric ward. This was done to test how the psychiatric hospitals would react. The second part was the reverse. Rosahan told the hospitals, he would send "fake patients". But he did not send any patients.
The results of the study were very controversial. When Rosenhan sent the people, the hospitals was unable to detect them. On the other hand, when he told them he had sent some patients, but really did not, the hospitals recognised a large number of "fake patients". The study said that it was impossible to tell a difference between the sane and the insane.
They also found out that many of the patients that they had hospitalized were using illigal drugs such as "magic mushrooms" and LSD
