Mother Teresa (born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu) (August 26, 1910 â€“ September 5, 1997), was a Roman Catholic nun who founded the Missionaries of Charity and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for her work with people. For over forty years, she ministered to the needs of the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying of Calcutta (Kolkata), inspired in part by Saint Francis of Assisi.
As the Missionaries of Charity grew under Mother's leadership, they expanded their ministry to other countries. By the 1970s she had become internationally famed as an advocate for the poor and helpless, due in part to a film and book, "Something Beautiful for God" by Malcolm Muggeridge.
Following her death she was beatified, which is the first stage of sainthood, by Pope John Paul II and given the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.
