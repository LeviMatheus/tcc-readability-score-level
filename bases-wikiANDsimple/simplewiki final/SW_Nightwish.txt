Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Finland. They formed in July 1996 playing acoustic mood music. Tuomas Holopainen came up with the idea. He asked Tarja Turunen to sing and Emppu Vuorinen to play guitar.
It was not until the beginning of 1997 that the band started playing heavier music. Jukka Nevalainen joined to play the drums and they swaped the acoustic guitar for the electic guitar. In May 1997, Nightwish signed a contract with Spinefarm Records and they released their first album 'Angels Fall First'.
In 1998, Sami Vänskä joined the band to play bass. This same year they released 'Oceanborn', which was much more complicated than 'Angels Fall First'.
In May 2000 they released 'Wishmaster', which was very similar to 'Oceanborn'. They also entered the competition to be Finland's entry for the Eurovision song contest with the song 'Sleepwalker'. They won the phone vote but the judges disagreed so they came second.
Tarja left the group in 2005 after their "End of an Era" tour. In 2007, Swedish singer Anette Olzon was chosen to be the new singer, and they released a single, Amaranth, and a few months later, a new album, Dark Passion Play.
