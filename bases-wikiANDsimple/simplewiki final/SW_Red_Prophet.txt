Plot introduction.
The second book in Card's The Tales of Alvin Maker series, "Red Prophet" is about Alvin Miller, the seventh son of a seventh son (which gives him magical powers), Lolla-Wossiky, Tenskwa-Tawa, and Ta-Kumsaw, Lolla-Wossiky's older brother.
While it is a separate story, the book continues and develops many of the themes shown in the first book. When Alvin Miller and his older brother Measure go to the place of his birth (where Alvin is supposed to become apprenticed to the Hattrack River blacksmith) the two brothers are captured by 'Reds' (Native Americans) and brought into a plot with possibilities of affecting the entire future of America.
