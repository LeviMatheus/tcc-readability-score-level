The Visigoths ("Western Goths") were one of two main branches of the Goths. The Goths were an East Germanic tribe (the "Ostrogoths" being the other). Together these tribes were among the loosely-termed Germanic peoples who disturbed the late Roman Empire during the Migration Period.
Most famously, a Visigothic force led by King Alaric I succeeded in storming Rome in 410 A.D.
After the collapse of the western Roman Empire, the Visigoths played a major role in western European affairs for another two and a half centuries. The Visigoths were well known for adopting the Roman Culture and the Roman's style of clothing.
