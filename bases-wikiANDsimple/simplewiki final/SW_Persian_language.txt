Persian is the official language of Iran (Persia), Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It is also spoken by some people in Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Southern Russia, and in other neighbouring countries. Persian was also taught as a second language in schools in Pakistan until 2006. In the past, all of these countries were parts of the Persian Empire.
The Persian alphabet is very similar to the Arabic one, but the language is in a different family than Arabic, so their vocabulary and grammar are very different.
It has taken on many French words. Persian has many dialects. The Persian language is locally called Farsi, Parsi and Dari.
