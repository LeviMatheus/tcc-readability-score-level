A possum is a marsupial. It spends the first four months of their lives in their mother's pouch. By the time they are six months old, the young possums live outside of the pouch. They have sharp claws. They are nocturnal and they have a keen sense of smell. They eat the leafy growth of trees, insects, berries, bird's eggs and sometimes their own chicks. Possums are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances.
The first possums were brought to New Zealand in 1837 from Australia. Possums are native to Australia and are protected there.
In New Zealand, possums have no natural enemies, so possum numbers increased quickly. It is thought of as a pest in New Zealand.
The possum has done a lot of damage to the native plants, animals and birds.
