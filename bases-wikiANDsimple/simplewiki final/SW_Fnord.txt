An Fnord is the typographic representation of disinformation or useless information with the intent to misdirect or confuse, with the implication of a conspiracy.
The word was coined as a nonsensical term with religious undertones in the Discordian religious text "Principia Discordia" (1965) by Kerry Thornley and Greg Hill, but was popularized by "The Illuminatus! Trilogy" (1975) of satirical conspiracy fiction novels by Robert Shea and Robert Anton Wilson.
