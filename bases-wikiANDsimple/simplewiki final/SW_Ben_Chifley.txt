Joseph Benedict Chifley (22 September 1885 â€“ 13 June 1951) was the 16th Prime Minister of Australia. He won the leadership after the death of John Curtin in 1945. His government tried to take ownership of all Australia's banks. This was not popular and the High Court said that it could not be done. Opposition leader, Robert Menzies said that Chifley and the Labor Party was soft on Communism. This is one of the main reasons why Chifley lost the 1949 election. He died soon after losing the 1951 election to Menzies.
