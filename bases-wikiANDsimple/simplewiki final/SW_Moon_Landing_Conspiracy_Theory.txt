The Moon Landing Conspiracy Theory is the idea some people have that men did not really land on the moon. They say it was hoaxed (faked) by NASA, the people who train astronauts and put rockets in space. They say that the Americans wanted to beat the Soviet Union (Russians) in the space race to put a man on the Moon. They think that when the Americans saw they were losing this race they set up a moon landing in a studio or in a desert so everyone would think they won. This is a very big conspiracy theory.
