Macedon or Macedonia (from Greek)) was an ancient kingdom in northern ancient Greece. Near it was the kingdom of Epirus (which was west of it) and Thrace (which was east of it). A long time ago it was the most powerful kingdom in the Near East and present-day Pakistan after Alexander the Great conquered most of the world that was known in Europe. This was known as the Hellenistic period of Greek history. It was later conquered by the Roman Empire.
