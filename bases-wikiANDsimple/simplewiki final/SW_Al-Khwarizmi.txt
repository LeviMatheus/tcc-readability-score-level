Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi (Persian:محمد بن موسى خوارزمی) (Arabic: محمد بن موسى الخوارزمي) was a Persian mathematician who lived in Baghdad around the year 830. He invented algebra and wrote a book about algebra. Therefore he is often called "the father of algebra". He also wrote a book on the "Indian numbers" and how to add and subtract them. During the Middle Ages mathematicians in Europe read his book. They called these numbers "Arabic numbers" (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12...) and used them instead of the "Roman numbers" (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII...). It is easier to do mathematics with Arabic numbers. The Roman numbers also has no number zero.
He wrote a book on Algebra named "Al-Jabr Wal' Muqibla" in which he introduced his on number system. And also introduced Arabic numerals. His books were translated in Greek and Latin languages. They named his books "So said Algorizmi". The word "Algorithm" is derived from the word Algorizmi.
