Baker Island is a small coral island, or atoll, in the North Pacific Ocean. It is just above of the equator. It belongs of the United States. The United States Department of the Interior is in charge of the island, which is currently called the "Baker Island National Wildlife Refuge". No people can live on the island because it is for animals only.
The island has no trees. The island is surrounded by a coral reef, which makes the atoll hard to approach in a boat.
