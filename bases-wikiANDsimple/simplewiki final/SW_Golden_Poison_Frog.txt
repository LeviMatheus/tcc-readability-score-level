"Phyllobates terribilis", the Golden Poison Frog or the Golden Dart Frog, is a poison dart frog endemic to the Pacific coast of Colombia. In captivity, poison dart frogs are not poisonous. It is in the wild where they are in fact poisonous because of what they eat. This amphibian of the dendrobatidae family is currently considered the most poisonous vertebrate worldwide. The optimal habitat of "P. terribilis" is the rainforest with high rain rates (5 m. or more), altitude between 100-200 m, temperature of 26Â°C, and relative humidity of 80-90%.
