Bush were a British post-grunge band, formed in London in 1992. Their debut album was the self-released "Sixteen Stone" in 1994. They have sold well over 10 million records in the United States. The band, while hugely successful in the United States, was less well known in their native UK and enjoyed only marginal success there.
