Pluto is a dwarf planet in our Solar System. It is made of rock and ice. It is very cold on Pluto with temperatures between -218°C (about -360 Fahrenheit) and -240°C (-400 Fahrenheit).
Pluto is 2390 kilometres across, which is about two-thirds as wide as the Moon and about one fifth as wide as the Earth.
Pluto is thirteen million tonnes in mass. The Earth has about 460 times the mass of Pluto. The Moon has about five and a half times the mass of Pluto.
Clyde Tombaugh found Pluto in 1930. Pluto was named after the Roman god of hell. This name was suggested by Venetia Burney from England. She was eleven years old at the time. Others say it was named using the initials of Percival Lowell, the scientist who had computed its position in the sky years before Pluto actual discovery.
Pluto has three moons: Charon, Nix, and Hydra. Charon is 1190 km across, half as wide as Pluto. Charon is about 19,410 km away from Pluto. Pluto and Charon spin around each other making the two look like a double dwarf planet. Nix and Hydra are much smaller, about 45-160 km across, about 44,000 km from Pluto. Charon was found in June 1978 and Nix and Hydra were found in June 2005.
There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto is very different from these eight planets. It is smaller than them and follows a different kind of path around the Sun. Pluto sometimes gets closer to the Sun than Neptune, because of the path it follows.
Mercury is the Solar System's smallest planet. Mercury is about twice as wide as Pluto. Mercury has about twenty-five times the mass of Pluto.
Pluto used to the ninth planet of the solar system. However, in August 2006 the International Astronomical Union said that Pluto should not be called a planet anymore. They said that it should be called a dwarf planet instead. This is because Pluto is very different from the other eight planets, and does not completely fill the accepted scientific definition of a proper planet.
