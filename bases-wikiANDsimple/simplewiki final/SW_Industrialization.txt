Industrialization (or Industrialisation, also called Industrial Revolution) is a process that happens in some societies. It is a kind of change that happens.
It is part of a modernization process. Using better techology, it becomes possible to produce more goods in a shorter amount of time. A single person can produce more things. They will also do more specialized things. Before industrialization, a shoemaker produced the whole shoe. He worked on one pair of shoes, finished that, and then did the next pair of shoes. With industrialization, there are many people involved in making shoes. An individual shoemaker has a smaller task, however. There is one person that cuts the sole of the shoe. Another person stitches it on. In short there is division of labour.
Industrialization started in England in the late 18th and early 19th century. There were several base techologies involved.
The industrial revolution also had drawbacks. A new social class emerged. These people were very poor, all they had was their labour they could sell to work in a factory. There were also other problems: child labour was common.
