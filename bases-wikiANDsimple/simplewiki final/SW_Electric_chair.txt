An electric chair is a specially built chair which is used on execution by electrocution (death from electric shock) of convicted criminals. The electric chair was invented by Harold Brown 1888. He had seen a drunken workman falling in a generator and dying immediately from electric shock. There had been a very gruesome botched hanging in New York 1886. The drop had been too long and the convict's head was torn off. New York wanted a less cruel method of execution and chose electric chair.
An electric chair is a stout wooden chair which has electrodes for runinng electric current through the convict's body. One electrode is attached on the convict's head and another on the convict's right shin. When the switch is turned on, a 2,000 volt current is led through the convict. The current is to stop the heartbeat, cause unconsciousness, and cause death. Sometimes the chair was made from the wood of the gallows which it replaced.
This execution method has been used only in the United States and, for a period of several decades,in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924, last in 1976). The electric chair has become a symbol of the death penalty, and a part of American folklore. However, its use is now on a decline. Altogether 25 US states and the US federal government have used electric chair.
Death in electric chair is usually quick. However, if something goes wrong, the death is more like frying the convict alive. The electric chair has been declared as a cruel and unusual punishment in many states and is no longer in use in those states.
The electric chair has many nicknames, such as "Old Sparky", "Hot Seat", "Yellow Mama", "Gruesome Gertie", "Sizzling Sally" and "Old Smokey". The execution itself is often called "riding the lightning". So far the latest person executed in electric chair has been Darryl Holton (triple murderer) in Tennessee, 2007.
