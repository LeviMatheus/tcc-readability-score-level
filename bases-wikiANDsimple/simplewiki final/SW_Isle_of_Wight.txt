The Isle of Wight is an island that is just off the south coast of England. It is about 40 kilometers (25 miles) by 20 kilometers (13 miles) in size. About one hundred and twenty thousand people live on the island.
The Isle of Wight is known as a county. This means that it has a council of people who make decisions about some things that affect the people who live there. The county town of the island, which is the place where the council work from, is called "Newport".
Lots of people like to go on holiday on the island. There are a lot of hotels and things for tourists to do there. The island really is quite spectacular.Queen Victoria used to like to visit the Isle of Wight where she had a house called "Osbourne House". Tourism is the most important industry on the island, and lots of people have jobs looking after tourists so it is awfully good that a lot of people do choose to come to the island!
Over half of the island is officially designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is also widely recognised as the most important site in Europe for finding dinosaur remains.
