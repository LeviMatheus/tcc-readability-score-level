Sara Evans (born February 5, 1971) is a traditional country singer born in Boonville, Missouri. She has had several #1 hits, gold albums and platinum albums.
Early life.
Music was a big part of her life when she was young. At age 8, she was hit by a car in front of her house and broke both of her legs. She spent months in a wheelchair and kept singing to pay her hospital bills.
At age 16, she began performing in a nightclub in Columbia, Missouri. She did this for two years. At age 20, she moved to Nashville, Tennessee because she wanted to be a country music singer. She met musician Craig Schelske there. A year later, they moved to Oregon, but when they married, they moved back to Nashville.
In 1995, Sara began recording demos. Someone named Harland Howard was impressed by them so much he he decided to help her get a contract. This paid off when she signed with RCA Records.
Her first album under RCA was called "Three Chords and the Truth", released in 1997. People liked it for being traditional, and it was in many Top 10 lists for that year.
However, country music radio didn't like it that much. None of the singles made the Top 40.
In 1998, Sara released her next album, "No Place That Far". People didn't like it because it was more of a pop-country sound. The first single (Cryin' Game) didn't do anything, but the next single (No Place That Far, a duet with Vince Gill) became a #1 hit. Because of that the album was certified gold.
