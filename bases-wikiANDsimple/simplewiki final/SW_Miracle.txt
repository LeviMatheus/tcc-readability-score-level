For example, a miracle under the first definition would be winning the lottery jackpot. A person who wins a state lottery would think it's a miracle that he won a lottery jackpot, but this would involve no violation of the laws of nature. People often win the lottery, but it is not very likely that he would.
A miracle under the second definition would be like a person being able to leap a tall building in a single bound. A violation of the physical law of gravity would have occurred.
A miracle under the third definition would be a divine intervention by God, where God's presence would be known during a miracle. The Bible, Koran, Mahabarata and the Avesta contains many references to this definition of miracle. An example from the Bible would be a man crippled since birth getting up and walking after Jesus told him to do so.
