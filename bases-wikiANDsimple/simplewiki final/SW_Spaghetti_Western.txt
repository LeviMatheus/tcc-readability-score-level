Spaghetti Westerns were a name given to low-budget Western films, which were made by Italian movie companies in the 1960s. They were different from the American western movies, usually filmed in Italian, had limited budgets, filmed on location in Spain and Italy with minimal sets, and many close-ups and artistic shots. Perhaps the most well-known of these films is "The Man with No Name" trilogy: "A Fistful of Dollars" (1964), "For a Few Dollars More" (1965), and "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" (1966). All three of these films were directed by Sergio Leone, featured music by Ennio Morricone, and starred American actor Clint Eastwood as the main character.
