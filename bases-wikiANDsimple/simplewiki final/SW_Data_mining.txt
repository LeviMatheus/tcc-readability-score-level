Data mining is a term from computer science. Sometimes it is also called knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). In data mining, you try to find new information in a lot of data. The information you get by doing data mining, is hopefully both new and useful.
Often, data is stored to use it later. The data is save with a goal. For example, a store wants to save what has been bought. They want to do this to know how much they should buy themselves, to have enough to sell later. Saving this information, makes a lot of data. The data is usually saved in a database. The reason why data is saved is called the first use.
Later, the same data can also be used to get other information, than was needed for the first use. The store might want to know now what kind of things people buy together when they buy at the store. (If someone buys pasta, he usually also buys mushrooms for example.) That kind of information is in the data, and is useful, but was not the reason why the data was saved. This information is new and can be useful. It is a second use for the same data.
Finding new information, that can also be useful, from data, is called data mining.
