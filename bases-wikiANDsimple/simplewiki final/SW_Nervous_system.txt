The Nervous system is a system. It is present in most animals. It is there to coordinate movement, to process the input of the senses, and to make the animals act a certain way. It is made up of neurons, nerve cells among other things. The gross structure of the system includes the brain and spinal cord, which together are called the central nervous system.The brain has billions of nerve cells to help think, walk, and breath. The nervous system can react in 1/100 seconds to stimulus, and the brain is about 60% pure fat!
