Sir Ian Terrance Botham (born November 24, 1955) is an English athlete who played cricket. He also played football. He was an all-rounder, which means that he was good at both batting and bowling. He was also very good at catching the ball when he was fielding. He played over 100 test matches for England. He is a very popular man in England. One reason for this is that he helped England to beat Australia in a series of test matches called "The Ashes" in 1981. This series is sometimes called "Botham's Ashes". Beating Australia at cricket is very important to English people. Now he works on television. He has done some long walks to raise money for charity. He was knighted in 2007.
