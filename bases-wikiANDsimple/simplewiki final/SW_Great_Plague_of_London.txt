The Great Plague of London was when the disease called the bubonic plague hit London in 1665-1666, killing many people. One of the reasons the disease stopped killing people was because of the Great Fire of London in 1666.
It was supposed to have originated in the Far East. It killed 40% of the English population. The First World War killed 1% of the population and the Second World War killed 2% of the population.
