A right of veto means that somebody can stop decisions or legislation.
For example, the president of the United States of America has veto power over the USA's parliament. This means that he can stop laws or bills from being passed.
Similarly, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (The United States of America, the United Kingdom, China, Russia and France) each have veto power. Using this, they can stop the security council's decisions from being passed and becoming resolutions.
