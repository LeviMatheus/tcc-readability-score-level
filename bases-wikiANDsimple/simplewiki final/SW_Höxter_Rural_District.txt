Höxter () is a Kreis (district) in the east of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
History.
In 1816 the new Prussian government created three districts in the area, Höxter, Brakel and Warburg. In 1832 Höxter and Brakel were joined together as Höxter.
The present district was created in 1975 when the former districts Warburg and Höxter were merged. At the same time the municipalities in the district were joined to form the ten cities that exist today.
