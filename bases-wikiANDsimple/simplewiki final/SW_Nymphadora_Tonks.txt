Nymphadora Tonks is a fictional character in the "Harry Potter" book series written by J. K. Rowling.
Tonks, as she is known, is the daughter of Andromeda Black and Ted Tonks. She is a "Half-Blood", but both of her parents are actually magical. Her mother is a pureblood, and her father is a muggle born, therefore considering that the majority of her father's family are muggles she is considered a halfblood, even though he is not a muggle himself. Tonks is a "metamorphmagus", which means that she can change her appearance when she wants to.
Tonks is described as being "seriously clumsy" in the books.
In "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", she marries the werewolf Remus Lupin and they have a son called Teddy Remus Lupin. Teddy is a metamorphmagus like Tonks. Both Tonks and Lupin die during the Battle of Hogwarts.
