Purebred dogs are dogs whose ancestors are all the same breed.
A breed of dog is a particular subspecies that has been bred through time to exhibit certain characteristics, for example a bulldog is bred to be short and have a flat nose while a greyhound is bred to be light and run fast.
Some dogs are bred to look special which is why poodles have fluffy hair.
