Scotland Yard is a police force in the United Kingdom. This organisation is also called the Metropolitan Police.
They are responsible for the security in Greater London. With over 31'000 officers Scotland Yard is the largest task force in the United Kingdom.
A particularity is that some policemen are on a horse. New Scotland Yard is in a 20-story office block on Broadway and Victoria Street in Westminster, about 450 metres away from the Houses of Parliament. The famous rotating sign, which is seen on television and in films, is outside the main doors on Broadway.
Founded on 29 September 1829, on a street off Whitehall, Scotland Yard was called "New Scotland Yard" when moved, in November 1890,[1] to the Victoria Embankment, beside the Ministry of Defence. In 1967, New Scotland Yard moved to the present 20-story building at 10 Broadway.
