The gastrointestinal system is the body system that eats and digests food. It also gets rid of waste after digestion. The gastrointestinal system starts at the lips and ends at the anus.
The gastrointestinal tract is the "gut" and other organs that help us digest food.
The gut is the round tubes that food goes through and is digested.
Food does not go through these organs. But they help the gut digest the food. They also have other work. For example the pancreas, thyroid, liver, and parathyroids are also endocrine glands that make hormones like insulin.
There are many diseases that affect the gastrointestinal system. Doctors who study the gastrointestinal tract are called gastroenterologists.
