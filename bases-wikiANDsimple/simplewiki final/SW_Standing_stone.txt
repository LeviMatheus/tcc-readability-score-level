Standing stones are stones that are set into the ground vertically. There may be single standing stones, or there may be groups of them. They can be found all over the world. It is hard to date them, or to see their purpose.
Pottery that has been found near some of these stones allows to connect some of them in Europe to the Beaker culture.
