Tools are objects used to help make tasks easier to do. Tools have evolved over time, and innovations in tools came during periods such as the Stone Age and Bronze Age. More useful materials were used and better tools were created. These creations and inventions became modern tools.
Some examples of tools that are often used today are the hammer, the wrench (also called a spanner), saws, and shovel. Very basic things like knives and pens and pencils are tools. The bludgeon (a stick or rock used to smash things) was the very first tool made by humans. The knife is also one of the first tools humans ever made.
