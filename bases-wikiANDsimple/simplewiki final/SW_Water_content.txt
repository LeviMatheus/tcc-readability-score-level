Water content means the amount of water a porous medium contains.
This term is used in hydrogeology, soil science and soil mechanics. In saturated groundwater aquifers, all available pore spaces are filled with water. Above a capillary fringe, pore spaces have air in them too. When the porous medium in question is soil, water content is synonymous with soil moisture.
