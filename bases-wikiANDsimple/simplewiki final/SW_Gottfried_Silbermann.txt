Gottfried Silbermann (born Kleinbobritzsch, 14 January 1683; died Dresden, 4 August 1753) was a very important German builder of keyboard instruments. He built harpsichords, clavichords, organs, and pianos. His organs were some of the best instruments in the south of Germany, some of them still exist. He had different ideas about organ building from Arp Schnitger who was an organ builder in the north of Germany. Silbermann also built some of the earliest pianos.
