Nitrogen is a nonmetal chemical element. It has the chemical symbol N and atomic number 7. Its stable nuclei typically contains 14 nucleons (7 protons and 7 neutrons). It has 5 electrons in its outermost shell.
Air is made up of about 78% nitrogen and about 22% oxygen.
Nitrogen is not poisonous. We can safely breathe it when it is a part of air, but we cannot breathe pure nitrogen by itself, because it does not have the oxygen that we need to live.
Nitrogen is formally considered to have been discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772, who called it "noxious gas" or "fixed gas".
Nitrogen Oxide is a typical medical use for nitrogen, also known as "laughing gas" it gives the effect of feeling "high", or "pain-free".
