A phrase is a small group of words that adds meaning to a word. A phrase is not a sentence because it is not a complete idea with a subject and a predicate.
In English there are five different kinds of phrases, one for each of the main parts of speech. In a phrase, the main word, or the word that is what the phrase is about, is called the "head." In these examples, it is printed in cyan. The words which make up the rest of the phrase and do the work of changing, or "modifying" the head, are printed in "green".
In a noun phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about a noun.
In an adjective phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adjective.
In a verb phrase, one or more words work together to give more meaning to a verb. In English, the verb phrase is very complex, but a good description of its many forms can be found.
In an adverb phrase, one or more words work together to give more information about an adverb.
In a prepositional phrase, one or more words work together to give information about time, location, or possession, or condition. The preposition always appears at the front of the phrase.
