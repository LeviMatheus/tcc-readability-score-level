Sugarcane (or sugar cane) is a genus of plants. There are between 6 and 37 kinds of sugarcanes (how many there are depends on the interpretation of what is a grass and what is not). They grow in warm and tropical climates of the Old World. They have stalks that are between 2 and 6 metres tall. These stalks contain sugar. Sugarcane is grown in many countries. Sugar is usually made from it.
