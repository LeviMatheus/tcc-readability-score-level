Torres Strait is the narrow sea that separates Australia (Cape York),and New Guinea. It is about 150 km wide and filled with islands, coral reefs and sand banks. The first European to sail through the strait was Luis Vaez de Torres in 1606. There are about 240 islands but only 17 have people living on them.
History.
The level of the sea was much lower up to 8000 years ago. Torres Strait would not have been covered by water. It meant people and animals could easily walk across between New Guinea and Australia. Some animals and birds can be found in both New Guinea and Queensland, such as the Cassowary. Other animals, such as pigs, arrived in New Guinea after the sea levels rose and closed the land bridge and didn't cross to Australia.
There is evidence of people living on the Torres Strait islands at least 2,500 years ago. It is likely that people were living there long before that, but rising sea levels will have covered earlier sites.
