The Dresden University of Technology ("TUD") is the largest university in the state of Saxony and one of the 10 largest universities in Germany with 34,993 students.
History.
The University is one of the oldest colleges of technology in Germany.
In 1828, the "Saxon Technical School" was founded to educate workers in technological subjects such as mechanics and ship construction. In 1871, the institute was renamed the Royal Saxon Polytechnic, and other subjects, such as history and languages, were introduced. By the end of the 19th century the institute had developed into a university covering all subjects. In 1961 it was then given its present name, the Dresden University of Technology ().
Organization.
The Dresden University of Technology is organised into 14 departments ("faculties"). Almost all faculties are located on the main campus South of the city centre, except for the Faculty of Medicine which has its own campus near the Elbe river, east of the city centre and the Department of Forestry in a town nearby called Tharandt.

Campus.
TU Dresden is a "campus university", This means that most of its buildings are in one area rather than being spread out across the city. Some of its buildings are more than a hundred years old.
