A pandemic (from Greek παν "pan" all + δήμος "demos" people) is an epidemic (an outbreak of an infectious disease) that spreads across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide.
Common killers and pandemics.
A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For example cancer is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious (although certain causes of some types of cancer might be).
