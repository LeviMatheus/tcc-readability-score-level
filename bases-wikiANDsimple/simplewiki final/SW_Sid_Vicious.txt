Sid Vicious (May 10, 1957 - February 2, 1979) was an English punk musician. His real name was "John Simon Ritchie-Beverly". He was a member of the band The Sex Pistols from February 1977 to January 1978, but played his instrument (the bass guitar) very badly. His bad behavior was more important to the band than playing his instrument well.
On October 22, 1978 his girlfriend Nancy Spungen was killed with a knife. It is still not clear if Sid Vicious killed her. Before he had to go to court, he killed himself by using drugs.
