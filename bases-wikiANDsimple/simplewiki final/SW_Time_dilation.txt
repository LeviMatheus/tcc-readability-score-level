Time dilation is a physics concept related to relativity and special relativity.
Types of time dilation.
In Albert Einstein's theories of relativity, there are two types of time dilation. In special relativity, clocks that are moving with respect a stationary observer's clock run slower. In general relativity, clocks that are near to a a strong gravitational field (such as a planet) run slower.
Time dilation in popular culture.
Time dilation caused by long distance space flight is depicted in many fictional (made up) science fiction books and films. In L. Ron Hubbard's book "Return to Tomorrow" (1954) and in Joe Haldeman's novel "The Forever War" (1975), people experience time dilation when they make long distance, high-speed space flights.
The science fiction television show "Stargate SG-1" has stories with show the time dilation effect being created by black holes.
