Anatotitan (which means "duck titan") was a type of dinosaur called a hadrosaur. It did not have a crest unlike its later relative, Parasaurolophus. An Anatotitan grows to be 12 meters long. Its fossils have been found in South Dakota and Montana. One of the skulls found measured nearly 1.2 meters long. The "duckbill" part of its muzzle is almost as wide as its head, which makes it larger than any another hadrosaur. There are two species of Anatotitan, "A. copei" and "A. longiceps".
Anatotitan was first discovered in 1882 by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope and was named "Trachodon mirabilis". Another hadrosaur discovered in 1892 was named "Claosaurus annectens" by Othniel Charles Marsh. In 1942, two paleontologists decided that C. annectens belonged in its own genus, called "Annatosaurus", and renamed C. annectens "A. annectens". T. mirabilis was renamed A. copei. Many paleontologists now think Annatosaurus is actually Edmontosaurus, while others think it belongs in another genus called Anatotitan.
Anatotitan was shown in the movie "When Dinosaurs Roamed America" and the television series "Walking with Dinosaurs".
