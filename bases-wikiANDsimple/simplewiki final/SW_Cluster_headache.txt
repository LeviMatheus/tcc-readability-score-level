Cluster headache is a nerve disease. Its most prominent feature is a severe and one sided pain in the area behind and around the eye. Headache attacks last 15-180 minutes and occur from once every other day to eight times a day. Most cluster headache patients are restless or agitated during an attack, unlike migraine patients who prefer to lie down in a dark room. Other symptoms are e.g. a runny nose, nasal congestion and/or a red and/or tearing eye on the side of the headache. "Cluster" refers to the tendency of these headaches to occur periodically, with active periods interrupted by spontaneous remissions. Some patients do not have remission periods. The cause of the disease is currently unknown.
