Piracy is a crime that people do on ships which are at sea. Pirates (those are the names of the people who commit piracy) usually have small and fast boats. They use these boats to enter large ships, which are usually cargo ships. As of 2006, the cargo ships that travel the oceans are huge. They usually have very few crew members. "Crew" is what the people are called that man a boat, and that work on that boat. Since the ships are huge, they usually carry a lot of money in the ship safe deposit. This money is used to pay the crew, and to pay for the taxes to stay at a port, or to pass through a channel.
Modern-day pirates usually enter the boat to get that money. In the process, they may kill the crew, or hold them for ransom. In very few cases, they may also take over the ship, and sell its cargo. Pirates are also known for their love of gold and treasure.
