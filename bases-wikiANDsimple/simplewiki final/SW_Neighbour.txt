A Neighbour is a person who lives nearby, normally in a house or apartment that is next door or, in the case of houses, across the street. Some people form friendships with their neighbors, and help them by sharing their tools and helping with gardening tasks. Other people become frustrated with their neighbors, if the neighbour makes a lot of noise or makes messes.
A group of people living close together in a small community is called a neighborhood. Some neighborhoods have many community organizations, where people volunteer and do charitable activities. Other neighborhoods in poor communities may have no community organizations, and there may be many problems in the community, such as illegal drugs, prostitution, and homelessness.
Other meanings.
The word neighbour can also be used for large groups of people, for example "a city neighbouring another city" or "a country neighbouring another country".
