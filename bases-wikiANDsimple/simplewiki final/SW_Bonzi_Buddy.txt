Bonzi Buddy was a freeware program from Bonzi.com. The software was available from from 1999 to 2005. It is based on the Microsoft Agent technology. The program is no longer used because it contained much spyware.
For the first version, they used a parrot called Peedy. After the first version, the company had to make up their own agent. They called it Bonzi. The fictional character was a purple gorilla. The first ever purple gorilla appeared on a yellow surf board. In later versions, they changed Bonzi's entrance from a surf board to a vine. The Bonzi website is still open and can be used for search engine but Bonzi Buddy cannot be downloaded anymore. People can still get the character file of Bonzi but not the program.
What Bonzi can do.
Bonzi Buddy could sing, say anything, download, browse, tell facts and tell jokes. He even had his own home page which when visited he would give the user a prize.
