The Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards or simply Golden Horse, also known as 臺北金馬影展 in the People's Republic of China, is a film festival and awards ceremony held annually in Taiwan. The ceremony usually takes place in November or December in Taipei.
The awards, contested by submitted Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China movies and from elsewhere, are generally held to be the most prestigious for Chinese language movies outside the People's Republic of China. The awards ceremony is held after the month-long film festival, which showcases some of the nominated movies for the awards.
Winners are selected by a jury of judges during the week before the ceremony is held. Winners are awarded with a golden horse statuette.
Under current rules and regulations, every movie made primarily in any dialect of Chinese language is eligible for competition. Since 1996, almost any artist or movie from the mainland China were allowed enter the awards.
