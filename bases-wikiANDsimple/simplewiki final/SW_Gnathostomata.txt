Gnathostomata is the group of vertebrates with jaws.
The group is traditionally a superclass, incluiding the familiar classes of fish, birds, mammals, and so forth, and a sister group of the jawless vertebrates Agnatha. However, recent genetic studies are causing a reassessment of Gnathostomata as a grouping.
The Gnathostomata first appeared in the Ordovician period and became common in the Devonian period.
