The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) (Turkish: "Kuzey Kıbrıs Türk Cumhuriyeti") or Turkish Cypriot State (Turkish: "Kıbrıs Türk Devleti") is a break-away "de facto" state in the northern third of the island of Cyprus. More than two hundred thousand people live in its 3,335 km².
Turkey is the only country in the world recognizing the territory as an independent republic.
In 1975 some of the Greek Army supported a revolution to make Cyprus a part of Greece. Turkey said that a treaty meant Turkey, Greece and the United Kingdom had to help make sure Cyprus stayed independent. Turkish soldiers went to Cyprus, and have stayed. The Turkish people who live in Northern Cyprus said that they did not want to be a part of Cyprus anymore, and formed the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
