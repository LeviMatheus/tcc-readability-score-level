In music, dynamics means how loud or quiet the music is.
In written music the dynamics are shown by letters which stand for Italian words for the dynamic levels. They are listed in the table below. Notice that “piano” is pronounced the Italian way (“pi-AH-no”).
Sometimes composers use more than two "p"s or "f"s to show that the music is very, very quiet, or very, very loud. Tchaikovsky sometimes used five "p"s or "f"s, though up to three are normally found in sheet music.
Dynamic levels are not something that can be measured precisely. Exactly how loud "mp" should be depends on several things: what is happening in the music, the instrument, the size of the room in which the music is being played etc. The important thing is that dynamic levels should be correct in relation to one another.
Some composers are very precise about writing the dynamics they want. Others leave a lot to the performer to decide. Historically, composers several centuries ago, such as Bach, only wrote occasional dynamic marks. Even Mozart only wrote a few, mostly "p" and "f". By the 19th century composers were writing dynamics in much more detail in their music.
Sometimes accents are shown by marks similar to dynamic marks. "Sforzando" means a strong, sudden accent and is abbreviated as "sf", "sfz" or "fz". The notation "fp" (or "sfp") means a "sforzando" followed immediately by "piano".
The terms "crescendo", and "diminuendo" (or sometimes "decrescendo"), mean a gradual getting louder or softer. They can also be shown by signs known as "hairpins". A hairpin opening out is a "crescendo", one which closes is a "diminuendo".
For a quick chang in dynamics, "molto cresc." and "molto dim." are often used ("molto" means "a lot"). For slow changes "poco a poco cresc." and "poco a poco dim." are used ("poco a poco" means "little by little", i.e. very gradually.)
