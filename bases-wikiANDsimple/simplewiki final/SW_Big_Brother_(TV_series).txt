"Big Brother" is the name of a reality television series that involves people (usually 12-15) living in a house for a period of time (often three months) in hope of winning a big cash prize. There are many cameras in every room in the House and the contestants (the Housemates) are filmed all the time, and are aired on television. The Housemates are completely isolated from the outside world. They don't have newspapers, television, Internet, even watches on their hands.
Rules.
Every week, each one of the Housemates must enter the Diary room and nominate two Housemates for eviction. For the two or more with most negative points are opened special telephone lines, so that the viewers (normally for about a week) can vote via SMS or phone calls which one of them to leave the House. The last remaining person becomes a winner and receives a big money prize, sometimes up to a million dollars.
