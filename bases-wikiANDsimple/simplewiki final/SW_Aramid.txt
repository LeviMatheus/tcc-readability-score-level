Aramids are polymers. The name stands for "aromatic polyamide". Structurally aramids are similar to proteins.
Stephanie Louise Kwolek developed aramids at DuPont in 1965. DuPont uses the trade name "Kevlar" for them.
Aramids are very present in security helmets, in splinter-resistant glass, in Ballistic vests, but also in other domains. They are used as a replacement for asbestos as a building material, for gaskets and other sealings, but also as helpers to make sails, parachutes and similar tools.
