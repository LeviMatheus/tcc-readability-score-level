The Treaty of Amritsar was signed on March 16, 1846 to settle a dispute over territory in Kashmir after the First Sikh War with the United Kingdom. The treaty was signed in the city of Amritsar. As part of the treaty land was given to Maharaja Gulab Singh Dogra. Gulab Singh was then able to rule over the lands to the west of the Ravi River including Chamba. Gulab Singh paid money to the British Government to get this land. The Treaty of Amritsar marked the beginning of Dogra rule in Kashmir, which was to end in 1948 after the rebellion of the Muslim tribal militia.
