British Airways (sometimes known as just "BA") is the UK's largest airline. It operates domestic flights within the UK as well as international flights to Europe and the rest of the world. It was formed from a group of other UK airlines joining together to make a big one: British Airways (BA). BA have one of the biggest fleet of aircraft in the world operating Boeing 737, 747, 757, 767 and 777 aircraft as well as Airbus A320 family planes and regional planes such as the Embraer ERJ-145. For a time during the 1990s BA had a World Tails scheme on their planes, each tail was painted in a design to symbolise a country of the world; Botswana, Germany, Sweden and Scotland were countries represented but many more were as well.
Terminal 5.
British Airways has its own terminal at Heathrow Airport in London, England called Terminal 5 or T5. It opened on 14 March 2008 by the Queen of England, Queen Elizabeth II and it cost Â£4.3 billion to build which is about $6.2 billion. It has been built between the two runways at Heathrow Airport, 27L/09R and 27R/09L. It is about 260 hectares big.
British Airways is the only airline allowed to use T5 at Heathrow. The other airlines that fly to or from Heathrow must use one of the other four terminals there. At the moment, not all British Airways' flights go to/from T5. Flights that go to Bangkok in Thailand, Singapore and Sydney in Australia go from Terminal 4 instead. British Airways plan to move these flights to Terminal 5 soon.
Aeroplanes.
British Airways owns 238 aeroplanes: 33 Airbus A319s, 30 Airbus A320s, 11 Airbus A321s, 33 Boeing 737s, 57 Boeing 747 Jumbo Jets, 11 Boeing 757s, 21 Boeing 767s and 24 Boeing 777s. They also have 67 aeroplanes on order. They are: 2 Airbus A318s, 19 Airbus A320s, 12 Airbus A380 "Super Jumbos", 10 Boeing 777s and 24 Boeing 787 "Dreamliners".
BA CityFlier and OpenSkies.
British Airways also owns two other smaller airlines called BA CityFlier and OpenSkies, which run different services than the large airline.
BA CityFlier runs flights from London City Airport to other major cities in the UK (like Edinburgh and Glasgow) and the rest of Europe (like Nice in France, Dublin in Ireland, Frankfurt in Germany, Madrid in Spain and Zurich in Switzerland). It is a fairly new airline that only started running in March 2007. It is also very small, only running 12 British Aerospace Avroliners.
OpenSkies in an even smaller airline with only two aircraft, old Boeing 757s from the British Airways collection. At the moment, it only flies to/from Amsterdam in The Netherlands, Paris in France and New York in the USA. The two Boeing 757s has only 40 Premium Economy seats and 24 Business Class seats with no Economy Class seats.
oneworld.
oneworld is a partnership between 9 airlines: American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Iberia, Japan Airlines, LAN, Malev Hungarian Airlines, Qantas, Royal Jordanian Airlines and British Airways. It also includes these airlines' partners such as BA CityFlier (but OpenSkies is not part of oneworld).
Being part of oneworld means that the airlines sell their own tickets as well as other members, (so for exmaple, British Airways would sell tickets for American Airlines flights). This is good for the airlines because the customers like getting their tickets in one place and it lets the airlines use flights that they wouldn't normally have. Also, oneworld has a "frequent flyer" scheme, where all the member airlines' schemes can be turned into this oneworld scheme which is recognised across all the member airlines. The three levels are Oneworld Ruby (lowest), Oneworld Sapphire (middle) and Oneworld Emerald (highest). It is up to the airlines to decide what levels are the same as their own levels.
