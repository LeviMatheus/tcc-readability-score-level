Doctor Abdus Salam (January 29, 1926; Santokdas, Sahiwal Punjab â€“ November 21, 1996; Oxford, England) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate in Physics for his work in Electro-Weak Theory.
During the war years a scheme was set up for the farmers to study abroad. He as a result went to England for studies. In 1951 he returned to Pakistan, but he found that he was cut off from the rest of the scientific world there. He again went to England where he started having interest in the Grand Unified Theory.
He believed that if the Creator of the universe was one then the origin of all the forces had to be be single also. He then set off to unify the Electromagnetic and the Weak Nuclear Force.
According to another scientist, Peter Higgs, a field existed i.e. the Higgs field. it had many corrugurations. Abdus Salam concluded that the Z and W particles, the weak force carriers, travelled on these rough features therefore they gained mass. while the photons travelled along these uneven features and therefore were massless.
