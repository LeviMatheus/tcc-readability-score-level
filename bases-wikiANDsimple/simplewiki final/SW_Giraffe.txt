A giraffe ("Giraffa camelopardalis") is an even-toed ungulate mammal from Africa. It is the tallest animal that lives on land. The giraffe and Okapi form the family "Giraffidae".
Appearance.
Giraffes can be 4.8 to 5.5 metres / 16 to 18 ft tall and weigh up to 900 kilograms / 2000 pounds.
Giraffes have a very long neck and legs. Their fur has a light yellowish or brownish colour with dark patches. Both male and female Giraffes have small horn-like stumps on their head which are covered with skin. They have a long blue tongue, which can be up to 45 cm long.
Habitat.
Giraffes live in Africa. Today they live in the savannas south of the Sahara.
Life.
Giraffes eat mostly leaves from trees, which they can reach because of their long legs and long necks. They can go without water for weeks.
Giraffes live alone or in loose groups. Young male giraffes form small groups until they become mature. Adult males live alone. Females form groups of 4 - 32 animals. When the female is close to giving birth, it leaves the group for a time to give birth to its offspring, and comes back 2-3 weeks after her baby is born.
After a pregnancy of 14-15 months the female gives birth to usually a single baby (which is called "calf"). Giraffes give birth while standing, so the baby falls down 2 meters. Giraffe calfs are already 1.8 m tall and weigh 50 kg. The calf stays with its mother for 1Â½ years. Young giraffes become mature when they are 4 years old, and they are fully grown when they are 6 years old. Giraffes can become 25 years old, in captivity they can become 35 years old.
