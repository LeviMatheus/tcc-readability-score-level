"Nirvana" was a greatest hits album of songs by the popular American grunge band Nirvana, who disbanded in 1994 due to the lead singer, Kurt Cobain's, death. The album was released on October 29, 2002. However, it was almost not released because of a lawsuit by Cobain's wife Courtney Love. This was because of a song on the album, "You Know You're Right", that Love thought would be wasted on a box set album. She thought it would work better on one CD. Soon after the lawsuit was settled (unsuccessfully) the album was released.
