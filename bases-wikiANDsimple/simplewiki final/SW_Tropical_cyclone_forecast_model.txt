A tropical cyclone forecast model is a computer program that uses meteorological data to forecast the motion and intensity of tropical cyclones. Such models utilize powerful supercomputers with complex mathematical modeling software and meteorological data to calculate paths and intensities. There are two general types, statistical and dynamical, and two primary types of forecasts, track and intensity.
