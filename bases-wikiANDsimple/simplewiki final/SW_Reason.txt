Reason or reasoning is a way of thinking that uses logic and facts. Reason tries to learn what is true or best. It is the opposite of using feelings and emotions. In common English, it is using your head instead of your heart.
Reason has been an important part of philosophy since Ancient Greece. Many philosophers have thought about what reason is, how to think using reason (Logic), if religious thinking and faith are ways of reasoning, what we can know if we only use reason (Epistemology), and if animals or computers can think using reason.
