A cult is a religious group of people. It is often a small, new founded religious movement. Cults have beliefs or practices that many people think of as being odd, or that have practices that most people in the world do not practice. Cults have been around for many years.
What religious group is or is not a cult is often only a matter of personal opinion. That opinion may change over time. What is at one point in time considered a cult may later be accepted as a religion. This is not always the case though. Certain cults gain popular acceptance and become religions while others are never accepted and remain cults.
Many religions today began as cults. As they got more followers and became more accepted in society, they became religions. There are also many religions that began as sects and over time became their own separate religion.
Because of how they are shown in the media (television, movies and news), many people hear the word "cult" and view them as being very bad. This may or may not be true.
Cults like Christian cults are groups that have some teachings that most Christians teach but may have some beliefs that are not taught in mainstream Christianity.
