BATBYGOBSTOPL is a 13 letter acronym used in Metlink advertising in Melbourne, Australia. It stands for "Buying A Ticket Before You Get On Board Saves Time Or Problems Later".
It is the centre of a Metlink advertising campaign to remind people they can save time (saving time meaning they don't have to worry about buying tickets on the vehicle or at the railway station) or problems later (problems later meaning getting caught without a ticket and being issued with a fine) by visiting a retail outlet which sells metcards (usually a Milk Bar or Newsagent). Two of the nine advertisements (seven radio, two television) produced tells people they can also purchase tickets online.
