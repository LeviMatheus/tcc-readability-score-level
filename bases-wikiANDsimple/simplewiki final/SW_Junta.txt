A junta is a Spanish word that is used for military dictatorships.
Often juntas got their power because of a coup d'Ã©tat.
Greece, Chile, Mauritania, Guatemala, South Vietnam, and El Salvador are examples of countries that were once ruled by juntas.
The most famous junta nowadays is that of Myanmar, but Myanmar is not the only country that is ruled by a junta now.
Some autonomous regional governments in Spain are also called junta.
