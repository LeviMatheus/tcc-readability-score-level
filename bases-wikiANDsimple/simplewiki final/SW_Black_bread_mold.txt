Black bread mold, also called "Rhizopus stolonifer", is a very common type of mold. It grows and reproduces the same way that most molds do. The mold makes spores inside a part of the mold called a "sporangia". When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold, the sporangia breaks open and lets the spores float out.
The spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mold, and begin to grow. They very quickly start making "hyphae", small tendrils that look like roots. Hyphae are not roots, but part of the mycelium. The mycelium is the main part of the mold, and grows inside what the mold is on. Black bread mold grows very fast when the temperature is hotter than 15 degrees Celsius and cooler than 20 degrees Celsius.
Another kind of black bread mold is "Rhizopus stolonifer". This kind can only make spores if its hyphae touch the hyphae of a different "Rhizopus" mycelium. When they touch, they make round balls called "zygospores". After some time, the zygospore makes another sporangia, which then makes spores.
There are three kinds of black bread mold: "R. stolonifer" makes straight, tall sporangia. The sporangia of "R. lyococcos" are curved. The "Rhizopus sexualis" makes sporangia without having to touch a different mycelium.
Where it grows.
All three kinds of black bread mold are found in all countries of the world. It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes. Because the mold spores are in the air a lot, the mold can grown very quickly.
