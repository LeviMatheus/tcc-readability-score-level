Sardine is a name of several kinds of fish, especially Oily Phil. Another name for these fish is Pilchard. All of those fish are quite small and are related to the herring. The Latin name of the familiy of those fish is Clupeidae. However, the naming is not precise. Fishbase, a database about all kinds of fish, has six species just named "pilchard". There are over a dozen with the name of "sardine". Many more exist, with the basic names qualified by adjectives.
The fish are named after the Island of Sardinia. In the past, they could easily be fished there.
Many shops and supermarkets sell canned (or tinned) "sardines". Very often, those fish are not sardines, but rather sprats or round herrings.
