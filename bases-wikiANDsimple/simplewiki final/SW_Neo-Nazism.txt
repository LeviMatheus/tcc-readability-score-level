Neo-Nazism means the ideology of some political groups who want to return to the beliefs and practices of Nazism after the end of World War II. Different groups have their own sets of beliefs and practices. These often include: loyalty to Adolf Hitler, hating Jews (anti-Semitism), racism, xenophobia (hating and fearing foreigners), extremist nationalism, white supremacy, militarism, and hatred of homosexuals (homophobia). Neo-Nazis often use the symbols of Nazi Germany such as the Swastika.
