Roquefort cheese is a kind of blue cheese which comes from the south of France. It is made from sheep's milk. According to the French laws about AOC, only cheese from the region of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon (close to Millau) may be called Roquefort cheese.
This cheese crumbles easily, and it is slightly moist. Blue mould is added to Roquefort cheese, which gives it a particular taste. Roquefort is produced in big wheels which weigh around 2.5 kilograms, and which are about 10 cm thick. Roquefort needs to ripen around 5 months. It is best consumed April to October, but of course it is available year round.
In the year 2003, there were seven Roquefort producers. The largest by far is Roquefort Société. Roquefort Papillon is also a well-known brand. The five other producers are Carles, Gabriel Coullet, Fromageries occitanes, Vernières and Le Vieux Berger.
Another cheese, which is similar, but made from the milk of cows, is Gorgonzola.
