Advertising is the promotion of goods, services, companies and ideas, usually performed by an identified sponsor, and performed through a variety of media. Advertisers influence our identity by making commercials. Many people agree that they influence our identity and they have a huge impact on our life. They influence our identity by using things such as techniques, stereotypes and targeting our audience. Our personal identity is who we are and what things make us up such as occupation, beliefs, personality, self esteem, lifestyle, relation ships, friends, how we look and what we wear. Advertisers use techniques to grab people's attention.For example, to make a burger look tasty in advertising, it may be painted with brown food colouring, sprayed with waterproofing to prevent it from going soggy and sesame seeds may be superglued in place. Advertising will bring new customers and more sales for the business. It can be expensive but can help increase a business's revenue.
