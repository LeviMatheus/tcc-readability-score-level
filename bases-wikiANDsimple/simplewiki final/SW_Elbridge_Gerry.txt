Elbridge Thomas Gerry (July 17, 1744 â€“ November 23, 1814) was an American politician from Massachusetts. As a Democratic-Republican he was elected the fifth Vice President of the United States, serving under James Madison, from March 4, 1813, until his death a year and a half later.
Gerry was a member of the Continental Congress and was a signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Articles of Confederation.
He was a delegate to the United States Constitutional Convention in 1787 but did not sign it.
Gerry was elected to the House of Representatives and served there from 1789 to 1793.
Gerry was elected Governor of Massachusetts in 1810 and served for two years. While serving as governor, Gerry supported a plan that would re-create voting districts in Massachusetts to give more power to the political party that he belonged to. The word gerrymander used today when a party tries to create more favourable voting districts was named for Elbridge Gerry.
Gerry was Vice President under James Madison and died in office on November 23, 1814.
