The Small White ("Pieris rapae") is a small to mid-sized butterfly of the Yellows and Whites Pieridae family. It is also commonly known as the small cabbage white or just the cabbage white.
Distribution.
It is common across Europe, North Africa and Asia and has also been accidentally introduced to North America, Australia and New Zealand where they have become pests on cultivated cabbages and other mustard family crops.
Description.
It looks like a smaller version of the Large White. The upperside is creamy white with black tips to the forewings. Females also have two black spots in the center of the forewings. Its underwings are yellowish with black speckles.
Habits.
Like its close relative the Large White this is a strong flyer and the British population is increased by continental immigrants in most years. Like other "White" butterflies it hibernates as a pupa. Along with the Large White it is sometimes known as the Cabbage White or Cabbage Butterfly.
Lifecycle.
It has two flight periods, April–May and July–August.
Eggs.
Its caterpillars can be a pest on cultivated cabbages, but it will lay eggs as well on wild members of the cabbage family such as Charlock "Sinapis arvensis" and Hedge Mustard "Sisybrium officinale". The eggs are laid singularly on foodplant leaves.
Caterpillars.
Known in the United States as "Imported Cabbage Worms", the caterpillars are green and well camouflaged. Unlike the Large White they don't store the mustard oils from their foodplants and so are not distastful to predators like birds.
