Bahasa Indonesia is the official language of the Asian country of Indonesia (since its independence in 1945). It is a type of the Malay language, which it resembles.
It is spoken as a second language by most natives living in the country, because they use a regional one (such as Javanese). However, Indonesia's education, media and communication all use Bahasa Indonesia.
The language's official name is "Bahasa Indonesia" (language of Indonesia), which is also used in English.
