Consciousness means being awake, alert and responsive with the environment. The definition of consciousness may differ in psychology, neuroscience, philosophy and other related sciences.
Consciousness is a spectrum. There are several states between a fully conscious state and a fully unconscious state. In medicine, the degree of "loss of consciousness" is measured by using Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS); a score between 3 and 15 is given to each person at any time, to show how conscious he or she is. Higher scores show more conscious states.
The opposite of consciousness is subconsciousness/unconsciousness. This means people do things that are instinctive and don't think about them like breathing and making one's hearts beat.
