Jackie Chan (成龍) (born on April 7, 1954) is an actor, director, stuntman and singer from Hong Kong. He is famous for his action-comedies. He also appeared in the "Jackie Chan Adventures" TV series. He is the father of actor Jaycee Chan.
In his earlier roles Chan did all of the dangerous stunts without safety equipment. Possibly the role where this was taken farthest is "Rumble in the Bronx" (his breakthrough American movie) where he subjected his already aging body to several leaps and falls which, while finally gaining his American stardom, led to injuries including a broken ankle.
His two worst injuries occurred during the making of "Armour of God" and "Police Story". Footage of the former's aftermath was shown over the credits and showed a subdued and bloodied Chan in a spinal injury stretcher. A tree branch he was to swing off snapped when he jumped for it. Chan fell 10 metres onto rocky ground.
In "Police Story", Chan was doing a stunt where he fell five or six stories through a series of window canopies. Chan became disorientated halfway down. Instead of landing on his feet, Chan fell in a head-down position. His arms became caught in the material of the last canopy. He landed head first. His head was forced to the side as he could not break his fall with his arms.
While the "Police Story" fall looked worse, Chan has said that the "Armour of God" fall was the closest he has come to death while filming.
