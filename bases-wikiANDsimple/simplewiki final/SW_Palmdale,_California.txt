Palmdale is the largest city in the desert area of California. It has a population of 147,897 and is the 6th largest city in Los Angeles County. It is one of the fastest growing cities in the United States, currently the 25th fastest. It has a population of 589,043 if you include the suburbs around it.
Even though Palmdale is in Los Angeles County, it is not connected to the larger Los Angeles population area. It is separated from it by a mountain range called the San Gabriel Mountains that are over 40 miles wide and almost 2 miles high overall.
Palmdale is the home of several airplanes used by NASA and the Air Force, giving it the nickname of "the aerospace capital of America."
Palmdale is the largest city in the United States without a hospital.
Palmdale Airport will have one airline called United Airlines that flies to San Francisco, California everyday starting in June 2007.
