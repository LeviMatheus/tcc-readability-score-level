The Nahuatl language is a language spoken by 1.5 million people in Mexico. It was the language spoken by the Aztecs, the Toltecs and perhaps by the people of Teotihuacan. Since the end of the Aztec empire, several dialects of Nahuatl started to exist. Nowadays people who speak different Nahuatl dialects do not always understand each other.
Also the names of the countries Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua come from Nahuatl words.
