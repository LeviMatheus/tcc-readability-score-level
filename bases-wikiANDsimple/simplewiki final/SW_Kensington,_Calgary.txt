Kensington is an area in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that is famous for some kinds of entertainment. People who go to Kensington (it is accessible by the Sunnyside c-train stop) can enjoy shopping, many coffee shops, a small movie theater, and many restaurants. Often the coffee shops are busy. There are two chain coffee shops - Starbucks and Second Cup - but there are also lesser known but still popular ones. These are: The House, Oolong Tea House, and Higher Ground. The Roasterie is another coffee shop that grinds coffee beans to sell and can often be smelled when you are walking on the street.
