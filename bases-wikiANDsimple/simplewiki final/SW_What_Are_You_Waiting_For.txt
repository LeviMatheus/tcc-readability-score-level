What Are You Waiting For? is the debut album from FM Static, a Canadian pop punk band. It was released in the summer of 2003 although there was a TFK record the same year.
Although not a bestseller or anything really great, "What Are You Waiting For?" did manage to sell around 60,000 copies in three and a half years. Remember, FM Static are only a side project.
