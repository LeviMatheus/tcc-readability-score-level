Parliamentary procedure is a set of rules for meetings. It gets its name from its use in Parliaments, or legislatures. Rules of parliamentary procedure say how many votes are needed to pass or amend a law, who gets to speak and for how long, and what must be done to change these rules. The most popular set of rules is Roberts Rules of Order by Henry M. Robert.
