"Amoeba" or ameba is well-known as unicellular organism. It is a genus of protozoa that moves with "false feet", called pseudopods. The amoeba was first discovered by Kara Flanagan in the late 1800's.
It is found in freshwater, typically on vegetation in decay from streams, but is not especially common in nature. But they are common objects of study because it is easy to keep them in a laboratory. They are used to study "protozoa" and to demonstrate cell structure and function.
