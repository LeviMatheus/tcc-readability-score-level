Kyūshū (九州) is the third largest island of Japan. The word "kyushu" originally meant "nine countries/provinces".
The original 9 provinces in Kyushu were Chikuzen, Chikugo, Hizen, Higo, Buzen, Bungo, Hyuga, Osumi, and Satsuma.
Today, Kyushu is made up of 7 prefectures.
As of 2003, 14,779,000 people lived in Kyūshū.
Parts of Kyūshū have a warm climate, like the Miyazaki and Kagoshima regions. Major crops grown there are rice, tea, tobacco, sweet potatoes, and soy; silk is also made. The island is known for many types of porcelain like Arita, Imari, Satsuma and Karatsu.
