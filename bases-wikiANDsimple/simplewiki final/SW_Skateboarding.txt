Skateboarding is the act of riding on a skateboard. A person who skateboards is most often referred to a skateboarder.
Skateboarding can be for fun, as art, a job, or a way of moving around. Skateboarding has been changed by many skateboarders over many years. A 2002 report by "American Sports Data" found that there were 18.5 million skateboarders in the world. 85 percent of skateboarders were under 18 years old. 74 percent were male.
