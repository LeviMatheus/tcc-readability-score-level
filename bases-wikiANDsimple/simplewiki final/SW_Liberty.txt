Liberty means the condition in which an individual has the ability to act following his or her own will, with other words political freedom.
Liberal conceptions of liberty think mainly of the freedom of the individual from outside compulsion. A socialist perspective, on the other hand, thinks of equality. As such, a socialist connects liberty (i.e. freedom) to the equal distribution of political power (i.e. democracy). They argue that liberty without equality means the domination of the most powerful. Thus, freedom and democracy are seen as connected.
John Stuart Mill, in his work, "On Liberty", was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion (being forced to do something).
