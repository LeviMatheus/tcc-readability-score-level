The British Rail Class 506 was a 3 carriage Electric Multiple Unit (EMU) built for local services between Manchester, Glossop and Hadfield on the Woodhead Line. They were introduced in 1954 and equipped with air-operated sliding doors. The EMUs were equipped with a single diamond-shaped pantograph, mounted over the driver's cab and adjacent guard's compartment at the outer end of one of the driving carriages (unlike other British EMUs, where the pantograph is mounted over one of the middle carriages).
