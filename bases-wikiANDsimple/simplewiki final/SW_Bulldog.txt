The Bulldog, known as the British Bulldog or English Bulldog, is a medium-size breed of dog that originated in England.
Description.
These dogs are small in stature but wide and compact with thick, massive heads. The muzzle is short and pug. The coat comes in many colors, including fawn, white, black & brindle. Black is undesirable in the show ring but not a disqualification and is recognized by the AKC. Because the stocky legs are set squarely at each corner of the compact, muscular body, the Bulldog's deliberate gate has become a waddle. They are good family dogs, known for their courage and their excellent guarding abilities. A lot of human attention is needed for Bulldog happiness. These dogs need little exercise or grooming except for the face which should be wiped daily in the face folds with a damp cloth. They weigh 53 to 55 lbs. and stand 12-16" at the shoulders.
