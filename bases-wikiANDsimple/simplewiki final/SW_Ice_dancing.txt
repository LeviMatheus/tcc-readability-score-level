Ice dancing is a form of figure skating which draws from the world of ballroom dancing. It was first competed at the World Figure Skating Championships in 1952, but did not become a Winter Olympic Games medal sport until 1976. As in pair skating, dancers compete as a couple consisting of a man and a woman.
Ice dance differs from pair skating by not allowing the man to lift the woman above his head. Skaters also must stay close together. They may not perform jumps.
Ice dancing is the only form of figure skating to allow vocal music in official competitions.
