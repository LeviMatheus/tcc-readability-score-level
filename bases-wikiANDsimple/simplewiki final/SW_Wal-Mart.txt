Wal-Mart () is a company created by Sam Walton in 1962. It is one of the world's largest companies, behind Exxon Mobil. Even so, there are many groups that dislike Wal-Mart because of their influence on local companies, the way they treat their workers, how they deal with welfare, selling mostly foreign-made products, and the things they do to the environment. Several debates occur across the United States about Wal-Mart and things it does or does not do to the economies of surrounding communities.
Sam Walton originally opened his stores in small-town communities across the United States; these stores provided lower prices for everyday items. Their popularity grew and stores are continually being built and opened.
