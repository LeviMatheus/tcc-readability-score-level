The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland.
The parliament of Scotland had only one house (cf. House of Commons, House of Lords) and was mentioned for the first time during the early thirteenth century, and the first meeting one knows of was in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II of Scotland.
The parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Three Estates the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament (), met until the Acts of Union in 1707.
