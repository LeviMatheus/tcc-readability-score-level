The Coptic Catholic Church is church in full communion with the Pope. The church numbers about 243,000. Historically, Coptic Catholics represent a schism from the Coptic Orthodox Church. They left that church in order to come into full communion with Catholic Church. The current Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria is Archbishop Antonios Naguib.
In 1990 Coptic Catholic sources estimated that there were about 10,000 followers in countries other than Egypt, under the care of local Latin Rite bishops. There are six Coptic Catholic parishes in: Paris, Montr√©al, New York City, Los Angeles, Sydney, and Melbourne.
History.
In 1741 a Coptic bishop in Jerusalem, Amba Athanasius, became a Catholic. Pope Benedict XIV appointed him Vicar Apostolic of the small community (approximately 2,000 people) that converted with him. Although Athanasius returned to the Coptic Orthodox Church afterwards, a line of Catholic Vicars Apostolic continued after him.
