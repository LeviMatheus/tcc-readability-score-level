An acoustic guitar is a type of musical instrument. It is a string instrument usually played with a plectrum and sometimes with the fingers. The sounds build up inside the guitar's body, going out through a soundhole. Acoustic guitars are used in types of music ranging from classical to rock'n'roll, to bluegrass and folk. The strings can be steel, or nylon. Nylon strings are typically used for classical and related styles of music, and steel strings are typically used for most other styles. Both types can be used for almost any music requiring acoustic guitar music.
