"Mario Party" is a series of video games created by Nintendo and Hudson. The idea of each game is that Mario and his friends must travel across a game board and earn stars and coins. Each new game in the series contains new characters, playing boards, and mini-games. (Every few turns, each character must participate in a mini-game. The winner generally gets 10 coins.)
