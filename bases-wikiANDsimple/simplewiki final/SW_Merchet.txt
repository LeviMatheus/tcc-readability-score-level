A merchet was a fine paid on a marriage in the Middle Ages in England. When a peasant woman was to get married to someone who was not of the same manor, her lord was paid money to allow her to be married. The money was usually paid by the father of the woman. This fine was paid because when the woman became married she would leave the manor with her new husband. Because of this, the lord would lose a worker.
