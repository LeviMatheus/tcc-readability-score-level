In botany, a leaf is an above-ground plant organ. Originally, leaves were used for photosynthesis. A leaf is often flat in order to absorb the most light, and thin so that the sunlight will shine through it. Leaves stometimes store food or water. Some planrts have changes some of their leaves to do other things.
Those plants that have leaves can be sorted into two groups: Those that have leaves all year round, and those that do not. The plants that do not have leaves all year round generally lose their leaves in autumn. Before this happens, the leaves change colour. The leaves will grow back in spring.
Leaves come in many shapes and sizes that help what the certain leaf does for the plant it's on.
