Embryology is the study of embryos or babies inside of mothers. It is sometimes said the babies are in the mother's stomach, but it is better to say they are inside the mother's womb, which is not where food goes. It does not only involve humans or mammals. In science the study of embryology begins when the male and female sex cells (gametes) create ova or sperm. Sometimes embryology can refer to sexual reproduction that is not sexual.
Carnegie stages.
Scientists have named 23 stages (or levels) that an embryo goes through in 60 days. These stages usually only apply to human beings or other big animals.
