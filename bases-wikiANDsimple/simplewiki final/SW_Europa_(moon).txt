Europa is a large moon of the planet Jupiter.
Europa's diameter is about 3000 kilometers and its surface is covered with ice. Scientists think that under the surface the ice is molten and there is a liquid ocean, a so called subsurface ocean. Deep under the ice and the ocean Europa may have a core from rock.
The moon Europa was found by Simon Mauris in December 1609. Galileo Galilei also saw the moon in January 1610 without prior knowledge of Mauris's discovery.
The moon Europa is named after a woman from Greek mythology.
