Hepatitis C is a disease caused by a virus in a human blood called the "Hepatitis C virus". HCV or "Hep C" are shorter names for this disease. When a person gets a Hepatitis C infection, they can get damage to their liver called hepatitis. This damage can lead to a liver problem called cirrhosis or liver cancer.
How can a person get Hepatitis C?
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is spread by blood-to-blood contact with an infected person's blood. Some people who get infected can get rid of the virus by taking anti-viral medicines for a long time.
People who take drugs with needles, get tattoos, or have unsafe sex are at a high risk of getting this disease. about 150-200 million people in the world are infected with hepatitis C. Hepatitis C is the leading cause of liver transplants in the United States.
Acute Hepatitis C.
Symptoms of acute hepatitis C infection include a decreased appetite, fatigue (tiredness), abdominal pain, jaundice (skin becoming yellow), itching, and flu-like symptoms.
The hepatitis C virus is usually detectable in the blood within one to three weeks after infection. The antibodies that the body makes to fight the virus can be detected within 3 to 12 weeks. About 3/4 of patients infected with Hepatitis C get a long-lasting infection (longer than 6 months).
Signs and symptoms that a person may have chronic (longer-term) hepatitis C include fatigue, marked weight loss, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, joint pain, intermittent low-grade fevers, itching, sleep disturbances, abdominal pain (especially in the right upper quadrant), appetite changes, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, cognitive changes, depression, headaches, and mood swings.
