The Carnival of Blacks and Whites ("Spanish: Carnaval de Negros y Blancos") is a carnival in the colombian city of Pasto. The carnival happens each year from January 4 to January 6. There are many tourists visiting this carnival.
There are four carnival days: the pre-carnival, the day of the Casta√±eda Family, the day of the blacks and the day of the whites. It is the oldest carnival in South America. It dates back to the times of the Spanish rule over Latin America.
Originally it commemorates the day in which the African slaves had a free day. Some historians say that in 1607, there was a slave rebellion in the Colombian town of "Remedios". It is said that when the news reached other places in Colombia, the African population went to the streets and danced, and blacked with coal all the white walls of the city.
Today the carnival is very impotant for tourism. People use costumes and masks.
