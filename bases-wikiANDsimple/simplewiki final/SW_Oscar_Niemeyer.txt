Oscar Ribeiro de Almeida Niemeyer Soares Filho (born December 15, 1907) is a Brazilian architect who is thought to be a very important name in worldwide modern architecture. He was a pioneer in the idea of using reinforced concrete for works.
Buildings made by Niemeyer often have the theme of having a lot of empty space, making odd patterns. The biggest work he made was the plan for the city of Bras√≠lia.
Politically, Niemeyer was a communist, which sometimes had a bad effect for him: When the military dictatorship of Brazil happened, Niemeyer was forced into exile. Fidel Castro once said "Niemeyer and I are the last Communists of this planet."
