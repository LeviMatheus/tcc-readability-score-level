Hyrule is a fictional world in "The Legend of Zelda" series. It is inhabited by many races, including Hylians, Gorons, Zoras, and others.
Death Mountain.
Death Mountain is a large mountain that Gorons live on. Ganon's also had his lair on Death Mountain multiple times.
Gerudo Valley.
Gerudo Desert is a desert that Ganondorf was born in. Only once every 100 years is a man born, so almost every Gerudo is a woman.
Hyrule Castle.
Hyrule Castle is the home of the Royal Family, which includes Princess Zelda. It's often the target of Ganon.
Kakariko Village.
Kakariko Village is a village made in "Ocarina of Time" that appears in many other games after.
Lake Hylia.
Lake Hylia is a lake in many of the games. It's often the way to Zora's Domain, the lair of the Zora species.
Lost Woods.
The Lost Woods is a forest in many of the games in the series that is easy to get lost in. The Master Sword rests here in "A Link to the Past", and Link's home, Kokiri Forest, is right next to the Lost Woods in "Ocarina of Time".
Great Sea.
Long after the Link from "Ocarina of Time" disappeared, Ganon returned, and when Link did not come to save them, they asked the Goddesses to flood Hyrule. Hyrule was flooded, and many people died because of it. Hyrule was lost under the sea, and people lived on islands that are scattered around the Great Sea. The events of "The Wind Waker" take place many years after. At the end of "The Wind Waker", Link and Tetra search for a new land.
Termina.
Termina is a land only in "Majora's Mask" that Link finds in the Lost Woods that he has to save before the moon crashes into it. It's an alternate land to Hyrule, and has many places and people that look or act like people from "Ocarina of Time".
