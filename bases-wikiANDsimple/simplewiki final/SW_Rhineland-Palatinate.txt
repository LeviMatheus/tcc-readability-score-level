Geography.
Rhineland-Palatinate borders on (from the north and clockwise) North Rhine-Westphalia (other German state), Hesse (other German state), Baden-W체rttemberg (other German state), France, Saarland (other German state), Luxembourg, and Belgium.
The main axis of the state is the Rhine river, that forms the border with Baden-W체rttemberg and Hesse in the southeast before running across the northern part of Rhineland-Palatinate.
The Rhine Valley is bounded by mountains with some of the historically most significant places of Germany.
In the northwest there are the southern parts of the Eifel mountains. Further south there is the Hunsr체ck mountain, which is continued by the Taunus mountains on the opposite side of the Rhine.
The hilly lands in the south of the state are called the Palatine Forest ("Pf채lzerwald").
These mountains are separated from each other by the tributaries of the Rhine: the Moselle ("Mosel"), the Lahn and the Nahe.
