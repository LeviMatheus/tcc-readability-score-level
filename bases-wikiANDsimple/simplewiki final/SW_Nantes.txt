Nantes is a city in France on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean. It is at the south western end of Brittany but it is in the Pays de la Loire region. Nantes has always seen itself as belonging to the (historical) region of Brittany. At the moment, it is the capital of Loire Atlantique, which is not part of the (administrative) region of Brittany. Furthermore, the Gallo language was historically spoken more than Breton in Nantes. Opposed to Breton that is a Celtic language, Gallo is a roman language, derivated from the ancient languages of OÃ¯l spoken in Northern France.
Nantes has about 280,000 inhabitants and a metroplitan area of about 550,000 people. Jules Verne was a famous citizen of Nantes
