Gel electrophoresis is a technique used for separating DNA of different sizes. This happens in a special gel electrophoresis machine, which is a rectangular shaped block of gel in a box containing a liquid (called buffer) and a voltage running through it from one electrode to another.
DNA is placed at one end of the gel block in little wells and, when the electrophoresis machine is turned on, the DNA runs through the gel towards the positive electrode. It does this because DNA has a negative electric charge and is therefore attracted to the positive electrode.
The important part of gel electrophoresis (the separation of the bits of DNA) comes from the fact that shorter bits of DNA move through the gel quicker. DNA can move through the gel because it has little holes in it called pores and these pores allow a passage for DNA molecules to wind through.
After electrophoresis has gone for a while, the gel must be photographed under UV light so we can see where the DNA has ended up. It's important to note that the UV light doesn't see the DNA itself yet rather a dye that is associated with it, such as ethidium bromide.
