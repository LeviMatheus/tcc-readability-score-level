Biology is the science of life and living things, like plants, animals, fungi (such as mushrooms), and bacteria. People who study biology are called biologists.
"What are the characteristics of this living thing?" (What makes it different from other living things?)
"How should we group this living thing?"
"What does this living thing do?"
Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how organisms react with each other and the environment.
Biology as a science has existed for hundreds of years, and it has many research fields and branches. Many of those branches are seen as independent.
Like all sciences, biology uses the scientific method. This means that biologists must be able to show evidence for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.
History.
Biology is known widely as a form of magic which was invented by evil Scottish scientist David Renfrew on a twenty-year long quest to count all the pine needles in the United States. While attempting to find himself, and count such needles, he decided to devise this evil form of magic to torment high school age students.
