"Flower Power" was a 1960s catchphrase, used by hippies and other people who were against war and violence. These people used flowers as a symbol of life, of love, and of peace. They wore flowers, made art with flowers and images of them, and gave them away often. Hippies sometimes placed flowers in the rifle barrels of marching soldiers.
Folk musician Donovan was one of the musical performers associated with flower power.
