In chemistry, a mixture is a substance that is made up of two or more simpler substances. These substances can be chemical elements or compounds. A mixture can be a liquid, a solid, or a gas.
A mixture is not the same as a compound, which is made of two or more elements (different kinds of atoms) connected together. For instance, a mixture of the gases hydrogen and nitrogen contains hydrogen and nitrogen, not the compound ammonia which is made of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms.
A solution can be a mixture. For instance, sugar dissolved in water is a mixture.
Solids can be mixtures also. Many kinds of soil and rock are mixtures of different minerals.
