Virginia is a state in the United States. Its capital is Richmond and its largest city is Virginia Beach. The official name of Virginia is the "Commonwealth of Virginia".
Virginia is bordered by West Virginia, Maryland, and the District of Columbia (across the Potomac River) to the north, by Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, by North Carolina and Tennessee to the south, and by Kentucky and West Virginia to the west.
Virginia became a state in 1788 after the American Revolution.
Before it became a state of the United States, Virginia was a colony of Great Britain. Virginia was founded (started) in 1607.
The state of West Virginia used to be part of Virginia. When the American Civil War happened, Virginia left (seceded from) the United States and joined the Confederate States of America. The western counties of Virginia seceded from Virginia to form a new state which was loyal to the Union. After the end of the Civil War, Virginia became part of the United States again in 1870.
Virginia is the state where eight United States presidents were born. This is more than any other state.
