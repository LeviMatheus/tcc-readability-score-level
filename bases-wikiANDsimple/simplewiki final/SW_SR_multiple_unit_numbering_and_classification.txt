The Southern Railway created classification and numbering systems for its large fleet of electric multiple units that were perpetuated by the Southern Region of British Rail until the early 1980s, when the impact of TOPS was felt. Even now, some stock have still been allocated Southern-style classifications in a semi-official manner.
