Polo is a sport. It is played between two teams of 4 players on ponies (small horses) who attempt to score goals (points) by putting the ball in the goal using long mallets (long sticks).
The main rules of polo.
There are two teams both with 4 players. They play on a field which is 300 yards long (approximately 275 metres) and 160 or 200 yards wide (approximately 146 and 183 metres). There are goalposts (long sticks in the ground) 8 yards (7.32 meters) apart at each end of the field. To score, the ball has to go between the other team's goalposts, which is called a goal.
The game is 4, 6 or 8 periods (units of time) of 7 minutes each which are called "chukkas". Between chukkas, players switch ponies.
In each game there are 2 umpires on horses and a referee on the side.
Polo ponies.
The ponies are 14.2 to 16 hands (1 hand equals 4 inches or 10.16 centimetres). They weigh between 900 and 1100lbs-pounds- (approximately 408 and 499 kilos). Ponies can be ridden to play from the age of 5 up to 18 or even 20 years old sometimes!
Equipment.
The players have a helmet (hard hat), riding boots, white trousers, a shirt with the player's number on. Sometimes players also have one or two gloves, kneepads and a whip.
The ball is made of plastic. Before, it was made of wood. The ball is about 3Â¼ inches (8.3 centimetres) in diameter and weighs about four ounces (113.4 grams).
Polo saddles are English-style, similar to jumping saddles.
