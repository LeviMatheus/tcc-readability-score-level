A Containment building is a building with a nuclear reactor in it. It is built around the reactor to keep the radiation from getting out, if something happens to the reactor. The containment building is the last barrier to the radiation getting into the environment.
The Chernobyl accident was so bad because Soviet reactors had no containment buildings and for some other reasons.
