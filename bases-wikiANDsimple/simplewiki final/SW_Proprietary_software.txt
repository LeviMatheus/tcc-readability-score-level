Proprietary (or closed source) software is the opposite of Free software. Proprietary software does not give others access to the source code of the software, or gives it but does not allow to, for example, give it to others, change, or sell it.
Most companies who sell their software for money, and even those who do not sell it, make it proprietary source to make it harder for people to copy it for free or at all, or to make similar software, or even to make it better. Software, users of which cannot see the source code, is often considered less secure that free and open source software, however this is not always the case.
