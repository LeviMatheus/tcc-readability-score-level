Khmer is the official language of Cambodia. Its script was the base for the Thai script, although Thai does not use subscript consonants. One thing that makes it particularly difficult for many foreigners to learn is that Khmer words are not separated in a sentence. But still each word in the sentence can be distinguished. Also, there is not much material on Khmer.
