A worm is an invertebrate animal with a long body and (in most cases) no legs. The most common worm is the "earth worm", a type of annelid. In some countries, people eat earthworms.
There are over 5 500 known species of worms. They can be found everywhere, except in polar or dry climates. Their size varies: they can be between two centimeters and about three metres in length. The biggest known earthworm is the Giant Gippsland Earthworm, one of about 1 000 earthworm species found in Australia. They are usually about 80cm in length, but can grow to about 3 metres. Some other worms are Tapeworm, Ringworm, and both of those worms are parasites!
The most common earthworm (in Europe, and most other temperate climate regions) can grow to a size of about 20-25 cm when extended.
Most earthworms can regrow lost segments. This capability varies by species though.
Other common worms include roundworms and flatworms. Some animals are also called worms, but do not belong to this group. For example, the inchworm is a type of caterpillar, and the slow-worm is a legless lizard.
