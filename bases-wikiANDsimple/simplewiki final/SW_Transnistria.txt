Transnistria, officially Pridnestrovskaia Moldavskaia Respublica, PMR (short form: Pridnestrovie) is an unrecognised country in Eastern Europe.
Although most other countries do not agree it is a country, the region declared its independence from Moldova on September 2, 1990. With the help of the Russian army, it defeated the Moldovan army in the War of Transnistria.
There has been peace since 1992, but the Council of Europe calls Transnistria a "frozen conflict" region.
There is argument about whether it is really a country or not. The region continues to say it is independent, and acts independently over its territory with the help of peacekeeping forces from four countries.
In a vote in September 17 2006, 97% voted to be free from Moldova. This vote has not been accepted by Moldova.
