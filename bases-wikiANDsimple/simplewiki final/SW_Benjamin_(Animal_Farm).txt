In the fictional story "Animal Farm", Benjamin is the most elderly animal on Manor Farm, and extremely hot-tempered. He seldom spoke, except to make some cynical remark. He was the only animal on the farm that never laughed, saying that there was nothing to laugh at when enquired about it. Without admitting it,Benjamin is devoted to Boxer, grazing with his in a small padlock near the orchard on Sundays.
