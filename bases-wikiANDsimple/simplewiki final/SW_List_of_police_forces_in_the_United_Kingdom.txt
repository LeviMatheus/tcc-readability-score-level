Scotland.
Most areas of Policing in Scotland are done by the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament, but some rights remain with the Scottish Office in the UK Government. These areas include national security, terrorism, firearms and drugs. The Scottish police forces provide all other police services to the public of Scotland.
Northern Ireland.
The Royal Ulster Constabulary was formed in 1922 to police the new Irish Free State. It was renamed in 2001 following the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 undertaken by the Patten Commission.
In Northern Ireland, police powers have not been transferred to the Northern Ireland Executive as they have been in Scotland, instead they remain with the Northern Ireland Office in the UK Government.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland does not employ Police Community Support Officers.
