A fable is a type of short story which teaches a lesson or carries a moral, which is usually stated at the end. The characters of a fable may be people, gods, animals or even lifeless objects. When animals and objects are used in fables, they think and talk like people, even though they act like animals or objects. For example, in a fable a clay pot might say that it is frightened of being broken.
The stories told by fables are usually very simple. To understand a fable, the reader or listener doesn't need to know all about the characters, only one important thing. For this reason animals are often used in fables in a way that is easily understood because it is always the same. They keep the same "characteristics" from story to story.
The most famous fables are those attributed to Aesop (6th century B.C.). Many fables are so well-known that their morals have become English sayings.
