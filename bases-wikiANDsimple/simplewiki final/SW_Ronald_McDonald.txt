Ronald McDonald is a clown character who is a mascot of the McDonald's fast-food restaurant.
He wears yellow and red stipes and has wacky hair. He lives in McDonaldland, with lots of others including Grimace, the Hamburgler, Birdy the Early Bird, Mayor McCheese, and the Fry Kids.
Jeff Giuliano was an actor, who played Ronald McDonald for many years on television. Later he became a vegetarian, and was sorry he had spent so much time promoting hamburgers.
