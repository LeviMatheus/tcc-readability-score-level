It replaced "What's Up Doc?" as the Saturday morning ITV show.
It starred Mark Speight as "Scratchy" and Elliot Henderson-Boyle as "Reg". The main gimmick of the show was Speight and Henderson-Boyle wearing "solid rubber wigs" (not to be confused with the character of "Sam the Lift" in CBBC's Incredible Games) and eccentric jackets. A stylistic similarity might be noted between this approach and Max Headroom.
