The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) contains name and location information about more than two million physical and cultural features located throughout the United States of America and its Territories. GNIS was developed by the United States Geological Survey in cooperation with the United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN) to promote the standardization of feature names.
