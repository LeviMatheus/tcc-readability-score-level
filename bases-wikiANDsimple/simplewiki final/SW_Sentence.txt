A sentence is a group of words that are put together to mean something. A sentence is the basic unit of language that expreses a complete thought by following the grammatical rules of syntax. We sometimes call a sentence a "phrase", usually if the sentence is not very long. But a phrase is not a real sentence. A real sentence has at least (a minimum of) a subject and a main verb to state (declare) a complete thought. Example: "Walker walks". A subject is the noun that is doing the main verb. The main verb is the verb that the subject is doing. In English and many other languages, the first word of a written sentence has a capital letter. At the end of the sentence there is a full stop (American: 'period').
In this sentence, "The dog" is the subject, and "is" is the main verb.
There is no verb, so we do not know anything about the happy dog. It is not a sentence.
Another meaning of sentence is the punishment that a court gives for a crime, such as the time for which a person is put in prison.
