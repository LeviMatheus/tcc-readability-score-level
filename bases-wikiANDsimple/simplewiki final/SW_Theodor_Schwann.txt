Theodore Schwann (December 7, 1810 â€“ January 11, 1882) was a German scientist who isolated and named the enzyme pepsin. He was also responsible for founding modern biology, and the idea of the cell being the foundation of living organisms. To him cells were very important because they made up all living things.
