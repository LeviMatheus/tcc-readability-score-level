The Sphinginae are a subfamily of the hawkmoths (Sphingidae), moths of the order Lepidoptera. Notable taxa include the Pink-Spotted Hawkmoth, "Agrius cingulata", being a very common and easily spotted species, the death's-head hawkmoths ("Acherontia" spp.) of "Silence of the Lambs" fame, and "Xanthopan morgani" with its huge proboscis.
