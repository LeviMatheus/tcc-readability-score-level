Cryptozoology is the study of animals that people think might exist, but for which it cannot be completely proved. It also is the study of animals many scientists think are extinct, but which are still sometimes reported. Those who study or search for such animals are called "cryptozoologists", while the unproven creatures are called by some as cryptids'", a term first used by John Wall in 1983.
Mongolian Death Worm.
The Mongolian Death Worm is a strange snake-like animal that lives in the Gobi Desert. Scientists do not know if it really exists or not.
People who have seen it say it is like a red, fat worm around 2 - 4 feet long. People who live in Mongolia call it "allghoi khorkhoi". These people also say the creature spits yellow poison that will kill you as soon as it touches you and it can produce electricity so powerful that it could kill large animals.
