The nasal septum separates the left and right airways in the nose and divids the two nostrils.
Composition.
The fleshy external end of the nasal septum is sometimes also called "columella".
Clinical significance.
The nasal septum can depart from the centreline of the nose; this condition is known as a deviated septum. Trauma, excessive nose-picking and cocaine usage can cause septum perforations, or holes developing in the septum.
An operation to the nasal septum is known as a septoplasty.
