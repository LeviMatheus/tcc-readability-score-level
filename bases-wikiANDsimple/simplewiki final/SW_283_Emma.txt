283 Emma is a big main belt asteroid.
It was found by Auguste Charlois on February 8, 1889 in Nice.
A companion for Emma was noticed on 14 July, 2003 by W. J. Merline et al. using the Keck II telescope. It is 12 km in diameter and is designated S/2003 (283) 1. The announcement is contained in the International Astronomical Union Circular (IAUC) 8165. It probably orbits at a distance of 370 km from Emma. When the orbit is known well enough, the moon will get a permanent number and name.
