The Seljuks (also Seldjuk, Seldjuq, Seljuq, sometimes also Seljuq Turks) were a Muslim dynasty. They ruled parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries. Their empire was known as Great Seljuk Empire that stretched from Anatolia to Pakistan. The Seljuks also fought the Christians in the First Crusade.
The Seljuks were one of the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan. Originally, the House of Seljuq was a branch of the "Kinik" Oghuz Turks who in the 9th century lived north of the Caspian and Aral Seas in their Yabghu Khaganate of the Oghuz confederacy.
