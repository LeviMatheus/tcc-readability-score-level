The Data Protection Act (DPA) is a set of rules written by the British government for people who use data about living people on computers or any sort of storage system, even paper records. Data means information like address, telephone number and e-mail address, as well as more personal information like job history and records of what someone did. The newest version of the DPA was released in 1998.
People who use the information are called data users. People who the data is about are called data subjects.
