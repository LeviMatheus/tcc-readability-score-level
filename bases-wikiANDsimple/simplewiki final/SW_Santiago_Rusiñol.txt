Santiago Rusi√±ol (1861 - 1931) was a Spanish Catalan naturalist painter, author, and playwright.
He was born in Barcelona in 1861, and died in Aranjuez in 1931 while painting its famous gardens.
He influenced Pablo Picasso as a modern artist, and also left a lot of modernist buildings in Sitges, a town from Catalonia very influenced by that artist.
