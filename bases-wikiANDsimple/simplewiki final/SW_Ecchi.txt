"Ecchi" (or "Etchi", from the Japanese エッチ "etchi")comes from the Japanese word meaning "lewd", "sexy", "lascivious", or "naughty" when used as an adjective, or it can mean to have sexual intercourse when it is used as a verb or noun. The English use of this word is usually used in manga and anime and it is used when the anime or manga has sexual content, such as skimpy clothing or partial or full nudity, but does not show sexual intercourse.
