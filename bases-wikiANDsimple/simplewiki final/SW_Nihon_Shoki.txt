The "Nihon Shoki" is an old Japanese book. In English it is called "The Chronicles of Japan". The "Nihon Shoki" is about the history of Japan up to 720 A.D., and it must have been written in the period shortly after that time. It is written in the Chinese language.
This book is important to people who study the history of Japan because it has facts about the early rulers not found in other books. It also has fables about men who it says ruled very, very long ago.
