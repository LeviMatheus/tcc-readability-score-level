Embryo is an early stage of animal or human development. The embryo comes from the zygote, and grows into the fetus.
The embryo contains the basic cells needed to create a living thing. The cells contain DNA, which is thought of as the building block of life. DNA is like a map, that shows every characteristic of the living thing.
