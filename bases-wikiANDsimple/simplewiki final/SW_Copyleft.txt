Copyleft is a name for a type of license. It is the opposite of Copyright. This type of license tries to be the opposite of the frequently seen copyright type of license.
Both copyleft and copyright licenses can be used for things like documents (for example books), art (for example music), and software.
A license tells what someone can do with something that was bought. It also tells what cannot be done with it without getting into legal trouble.
A "copyleft" license tries to allow more things, and tries to give more 'rights', while a "copyright" license tells more about things that cannot be done.
