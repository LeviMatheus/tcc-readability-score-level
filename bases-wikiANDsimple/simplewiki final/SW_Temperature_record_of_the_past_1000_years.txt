Many scientists and others are interested in the temperature record of Earth. Especially the temperature changes in the past 1000 years.
Temperatures were not measured that far back, so weather records are used. Unfortunatly, the weather records can be wrong, so the final temperature records are not accurate.
The average worldwide temperature will drop in about two centuries, for an ice age will occur.
As fresh water, from the melting ice caps, is added to the Atlantic Ocean, the North Atlantic Current will come to a halt. This current is based on a balance of salt water and fresh water. Fresh water from the ice caps will damage this balance, the current will stop, and Europe, which is kept warm during the winter because of the North Atlantic Current, will freeze.
