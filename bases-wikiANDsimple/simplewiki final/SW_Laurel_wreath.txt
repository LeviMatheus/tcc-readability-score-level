A laurel wreath is a horseshoe or circle-shaped wreath made from laurel that can be worn on the head. In Greek mythology, the god Apollo is shown wearing a laurel wreath because of the story of Apollo and Daphne. In Ancient Greece it was given to special people, such as winners in competitions in poetry or sports, such as the Ancient Olympic Games.
It was also used in Ancient Rome, and Roman Emperors are often shown wearing laurel wreaths.
Until our time laurel wreaths are used to show that someone has done something special (for example the Summer Olympics 2004 in Athens, Greece gave laurel wreaths to the winners). The saying "resting on one's laurels" comes from this and means that someone relaxes now because he or she did something good in the past.
