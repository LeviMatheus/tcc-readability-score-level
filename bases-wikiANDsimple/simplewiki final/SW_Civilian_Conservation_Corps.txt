The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was started by Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression. The "CCC" gave young men jobs such as fighting forest fires, digging ditches, and planting trees. The "CCC" paid these men about thirty dollars a day. At first, it was planned to get men out of the cities, but more men came from small towns and rural areas.
