Nikola Tesla (July 10, 1856 – c. January 7, 1943; Serbian Cyrillic: Никола Тесла) was a Serbian-American inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer, and electrical engineer. He was born in Smiljan, in Austria-Hungary, now in the Republic of Croatia.
He invented the radio. His main discoveries were in the fields of magnetism and electricity. He is best known for his contributions that lead to the development of Alternating current. The reason alternating current is better than non-alternating current is that less of it is lost when the current is transmitted over long distances.
The SI unit measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field formula_1), the tesla, was named in his honour (at the "Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures", Paris, 1960).
Although Tesla was very famous for his discoveries, he died a poor man. What is more, he did not get credit for inventing the radio until after he died. Most people regarded Tesla as a mad scientist. Tesla got his first job in Budapest, working at a telephone company. Even in his early life, he was always inventing things. He invented a loudspeaker for telephones. Tesla also had mental problems starting from an early age. He suffered form obsessive-compulsive disorder.
He had a nervous breakdown while working in Budapest.
