A space race is a period in history when two countries compete or have a race to explore and put things in space. So far there has only been one space race, between the USSR and the United States. This happened between the 1950s and the 1970s. While the Soviets were the first to put a satellite in space and launch rockets with women and men, the United States was the first to put a man on the moon.
The Space Race was a competition of space exploration between the Soviet Union and the United States, which lasted from 1957 to 1975. It had to do with the efforts to explore outer space with artificial satellites, to send humans into space, and to land them on the Moon.
The Space Race began after the Soviet launch of "Sputnik 1" on 4 October 1957. The term "Space Race" started as a comparison to the arms race. The Space Race became an important part of the rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Space technology became an extra important area in this rivalry, because of possible military uses.
