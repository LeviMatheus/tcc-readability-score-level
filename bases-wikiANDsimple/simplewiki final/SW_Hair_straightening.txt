Hair straightening is where a person makes their hair more straight. Their hair may be curly, wavy, or almost straight, but straightening it makes it straighter.
There are two different types of straightening: Temporary and Permanent. Temporary hair straightening keeps the hair straight until it gets wet or damp again, so only lasts for up to a few days. Permanent hair straightening keeps the hair straight for up to a few months, even when the hair gets wet.
