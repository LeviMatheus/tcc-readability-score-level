In music, a solo is a song or a section of a song that is performed by one person. This could be a performance with one musical instrument (for example, a piano solo or flute solo). A solo can also be a song that is sung by a single performer.
Dance.
Similar to a solo in music, a dance solo is when a dancer performs a dance alone. This is different from a two people dancing together or a group of people dancing together in a synchronized way.
A person who performs a solo song or dance is called a "soloist".
