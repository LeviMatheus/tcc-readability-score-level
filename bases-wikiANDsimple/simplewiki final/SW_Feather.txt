Feathers are the things which cover birds. Feathers help keep birds warm. Feathers also protect them from injury. In most kinds of birds, feathers help them to fly.
Vaned feathers.
The feathers which cover the outside of a bird are called "vaned feathers". A vaned feather has a stiff center, with soft barbs on the side, which seem like hairs. The center is called a "quill".
Down feathers.
Young birds have small feathers, called "down", which keep them warm, but can not be used for flying. Down is very soft. Adult birds have down, but also have vaned feathers on top of the down. Down is also used in blankets.
Moulting.
Birds lose their feathers at certain times. This is called "moulting". By moulting, a bird can replace old feathers with new ones. Many birds moult once every year.
Color.
Feathers give birds color. Color is used to identify kinds of birds. It is also used by male birds to attract female birds. Colour can vary from bird to bird, making it easier to tell which species it it.
Use by people.
People use feathers for many purposes. In the past, quills were commonly used as pens, and colorful feathers were worn on hats. Many pillows, cushions, mattresses, coats, and quilts are stuffed with down. Feathers are also used by people of many tribes for decoration.
