The Le Chatelier's principle is a principle used in chemistry. It is a system that tries to make up for the changes that affect the system at equilibrium.
Overview.
It is used to see the effects of relations between concentration, pressure, and temperature. If a change of condition is added onto a system at equilibrium, the equilibrium position will shift in the direction that wants to reduce that change.
Concentration.
Equilibrium is measured by concentration of a chemistry substance. If there is more concentration, the extra material must be used up to try to set the change back at equilibrium. It tries to fill the void.
Pressure.
Pressure is applied to an airy substance called gas. If there is more pressure, the system will take away the number of molecules, leaving with fewer gas molecules.
Temperature.
If heat is added, the system moves away from heat so it can use it up.
