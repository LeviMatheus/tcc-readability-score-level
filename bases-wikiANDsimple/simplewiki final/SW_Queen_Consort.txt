A Queen Consort is the wife of a King. She is not the head of state, and does not have any powers unless they are given by the King or another law.
A Queen Regnant is Head of State, and has all the powers of a sovereign.
A queen consort usually keeps the title of Queen after her husband's death, for example
A queen regnant does not keep the title of queen if she "abdicates" (resigns). No Queen has ever abdicated in the United Kingdom, but in the Netherlands
