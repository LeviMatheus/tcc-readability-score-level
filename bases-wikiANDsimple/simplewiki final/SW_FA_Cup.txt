The FA Cup is a national football competition between all league clubs in England. The winner of the FA Cup usually goes through to the UEFA Cup of the following season. If the winner of the FA Cup has already qualified for a European competition, then the UEFA Cup place goes to the runner-up. If the runner-up has also qualified for a European competition, then the UEFA Cup place goes to 6th or 7th place, depending on who won the Football League Cup.
