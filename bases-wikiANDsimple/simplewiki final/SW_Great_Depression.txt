The Great Depression was a time when the economy in the United States and throughout the world was extremely bad. It began with the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The prices on the Wall Street stock market fell a lot from October 24 to October 29, 1929. Many people lost their jobs. They became homeless and poor. This ended the wealth of the Roaring Twenties. The day that is said to have started the Great Depression is called Black Tuesday.
When the Great Depression started, Herbert Hoover was the president of the United States. People voted for a new president in 1932. His name was Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt got the government to pass many new laws and programs to help people who were hurt by the Great Depression. These programs were called the New Deal. One of these programs was the Civilian Conservation Corps or CCC. The CCC put many young men to work in the outdoors. The men were paid 1 dollar a week to work, and they got free food and shelter. Another one of these programs was called Social Security. Social Security gave old people a small income so they had money for things they needed.
Between 1939 and 1944, more people had jobs again because of World War II, and the Great Depression came to an end.
