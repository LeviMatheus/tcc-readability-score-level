Male enhancement supplements work by increasing the amount of blood flow the genital region receives and the volume of blood that it can retain. In a flaccid state, the penis, like any other part of the body, receives a normal amount of blood flow. When an erection occurs, the penis is surged with a rich supply of blood which is then trapped in the spongy tissues of the Cavernosa and Spongiosum.
Male enhancement supplements can be synthetic or herbal. Synthetic ones may have more side-effects.
The time it takes to see results, said to be a matter of weeks, depends on a man's body type, eating habits, overall health, genetics, and other factors.
