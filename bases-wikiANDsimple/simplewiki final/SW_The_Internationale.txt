"The Internationale" (French:L'Internationale, pronounced, Russian:С Интернационалом [S Internatsionalom], Chinese:國際歌 [Pinyin:Guójìgē]) is a highly well known French socialist, communist, and anarchist song. It is also sung in Russian and Chinese. The Russian version, written by Аркадий Яковлевич Коц (Arkady Yakolevich Kots), was, before 1944, the national anthem of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The French words, written by Eugene Pottier, were originally supposed to be sung to the tune of "La Marseillaise". The song is known by its tune, and it's refrain, "Cest la Lutte Finale, Groupons-nous, et demain, L'Inter nationale, Sera le genre humain". The Chinese lyrics were written by 瞿秋白, or Qu Qiubai.
