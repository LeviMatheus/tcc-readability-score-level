Hunting is going out to kill animals. Predators and some humans hunt for food. Other humans do it as a sport. Many places have laws that limit hunting. People were hunting since the stone age. They used spears at that time, and now people use guns and bow and arrows. Some people even kill the animals to make clothes, or for decorating their homes, or even sell them for money.
Hunting can be helpful by keeping animal populations from getting too high. Hunting too much, though, can make a species become extinct. Huncting once caused the dodo, a bird, to become extinct.
