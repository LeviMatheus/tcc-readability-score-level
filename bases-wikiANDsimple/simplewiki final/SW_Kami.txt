Kami (ç¥ž) is a Japanese word for the spirits that are worshipped in the Shintoist religion. Not all of Kami are gods, because some of these spirits are not personified, but have to do with phenomenons and events like the growth of trees, or rain, or other things in Nature; it is believed that these kami live in those natural things.
It is usually said that there are. In Japanese the number "eight-million" is normally used to mean infinity.
