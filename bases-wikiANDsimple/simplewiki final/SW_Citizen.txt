A citizen is someone who is a member of a country. People can be citizens because they were born in a country. People can also be "naturalized" citizens. If someone was born in one country but became a citizen of another country, they are a naturalized citizen of that other country. For example, actor Peter Lorre was born 1904 in Hungary. In the 1940s, he moved to the United States and became a citizen of the United States. Lorre was born a Hungarian citizen and later became a naturalized United States citizen.
Someone who live in a smaller area like a city can also be called a citizen of that city.
