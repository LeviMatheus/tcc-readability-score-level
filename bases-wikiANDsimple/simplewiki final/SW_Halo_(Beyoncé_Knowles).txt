"Halo" is a song by American Contemporary R&B singer Beyoncé Knowles. It was written by Ryan Tedder, Evan Bogart and Knowles for her third studio album, "I Am... Sasha Fierce". The song will be released in January 2009 as the album's fourth single. Even before its official release the song debuted on the "Billboard" Pop 100 at number 87.
Background.
Ryan Tedder wrote the song for Leona Lewis to sing. However, in an interview, Leona Lewis stated that she did not have the time to record the track for her album and felt that it better suited Beyoncé.
The video premiered exclusively on iTunes on December 23, simultaneously with the music video for "Diva".
Music video.
The music video was shot in late November and directed by Philip Andelman. It features actor Michael Ealy as Knowles' love interest and is the first video from the album to be shot fully in colour. The song was cut to be shorter for the music video and only part of the song is actually sung by Beyoncé while during other times it is just the music playing in the background while the video progresses.
The video begins with Beyoncé up against a wall with a window behind her with light shinning. As the video progresses the scenes vary in different parts of the house were one scene is Beyoncé dancing to some chorography in a leotard with her love interest looking down at her from a balcony. During the climax Beyoncé is seen underwater in white clothing and when the chorus begins, Beyoncé opens her eyes. The last scene is played with Beyoncé lying down with Michael Ealy above her and only there faces are shot for the scene as Beyoncé sing's out the rest of the song.
