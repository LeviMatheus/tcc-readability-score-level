Windows 95 was a Microsoft operating system released in 1995. It was popular from 1995 to 1998 when the next Microsoft Windows version was released. It added many new features to the previous Windows operating system, which was Windows 3.x. This was the first Windows to use the "Start" button. Since then it has been used in all Windows operating systems.
Windows 95 was Microsoft's first operating system to support long file names. Before that, file names could only be eight characters (letters, numbers, or symbols) long, plus the file extension.
Although Windows 95 is thought of as a full operating system, it is not. Instead, it uses an older Microsoft operation system called MS-DOS and adds itself to that. This means that Microsoft can run both MS-DOS programs and Windows ones. Windows 95 was also Microsoft's first operating system to fully support CD-ROMs, though Windows 3.x could also access CD-ROMs.
