Józef Klemens Piłsudski (December 5, 1867 – May 12, 1935) was an important leader of Poland.
From 1795 to 1918, Poland wasn't independent. It was parted (in 3 pieces) beetween Russia, Prussia (Germany) and Austria (Austria-Hungary). Piłsudski was born in the Russian part. The government tried to make Poles become Russian but Piłsudski was born in family of patriots. In 1887 he had troubles, because he helped people who tried to kill tsar. He was sent to Siberia. When he came back from there he liked some ideas of socialism.
Later Piłsudski was a soldier and wanted to make Poland independent again. At the beginning of World War I his people helped Austria-Hungary, because they prefered them from Russia. Then they stopped helping Austria-Hungary and Germany so Piłsudski was arrested. When the War was finished, he was free. He came to Warsaw in November 1918 and helped to organise Poland. Then, for a short time, he became its leader (not president). Later, there were two presidents: Gabriel Narutowicz (he was shot by his enemy) and Stanisław Wojciechowski. Poland's situation wasn't good and politicians argued a lot. Many people, especially the soldiers, wanted Piłsudski back, so he told Wojciechowski to resign. When Wojciechowski said no, Piłsudki took over with the help of the Army. Parliament elected Ignacy Mościcki to be the new president and he was Piłsudski's man. Together, they changed the Polish constitution and made a lot of other changes.
