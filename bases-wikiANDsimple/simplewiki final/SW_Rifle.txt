The rifle is a gun with a stock to brace against the shoulder and a barrel with twisting grooves. The grooves are called "rifling" and make bullets spin as they fly through the air.
Rifles are made to shoot many different sizes of bullets and different amounts of gun powder. Rifles are usually made to be able to hit targets far away from the shooter.
Modern rifles are made for many different purposes. Some are made for hunting animals. Some are made for soldiers to use in war. Some are made for police to have in case they need them. Some are made for target shooting.
Rifles can work in different ways. Some rifles have what is called a bolt action, where a small handle is used to move a part of the rifle, letting the shooter put a bullet in ready for firing and taking that bullet to the right place in the rifle. The rifle in the picture above is a bolt action. Some are semi-automatics, where several bullets are put in at once. When the trigger is pulled, the bullet is fired and the next one is brought into place. Some are fully automatic, which work like semi-automatics but allow the shooter to fire more than one bullet at a time by holding down the trigger.
