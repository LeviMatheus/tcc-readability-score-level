Computer engineering is the science of making parts of electrical machines, like computers. Computer engineers think of how best to make these parts using what they have, and how to make the parts smaller and better.
Computer Engineering is about both electrical engineering and computer science.If you major in Computer Engineering, you'll learn all about the hardware and software of computer science. You'll gain a solid understanding of circuit theory and electronic circuits, too. Also, because Computer Engineering is closely linked with Electrical Engineering, the fields are found in the same department at many universities.
Computer engineering is often compared with computer science. In korea, they are same. But, there are some differences. Computer engineering is almost associated with hardware, computer science is almost associated with software.
Computer engineering is making computer and electric circuits faster and computer science is making programs, animations etc.
Computer Engineering is a difficult major but it's a major that's in demand. Software engineering companies, telecommunications firms, designers of digital hardware, and many other business companies hire Computer Engineering majors right out of college and pay them well. Computer Engineering also makes great preparation for medical school, business school, and law school.
Computer Engineering students learn about computer and computer related system design and development. The related systems are software system, hardware system and software and hardware combined system.The students also need to learn the science subjects, fundamental calculus and a subject related to designs.
