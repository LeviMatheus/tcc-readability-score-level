Condensation is the process in which water vapour changes into a water droplet or ice crystal. Condensation is an important part of the water cycle.
Process.
Condensation of water is when water turns from gas to a liquid or crystal shape. Any gas can condensate, usually at a low temperatures or high pressure. However, condensation can technically happen at any temperature, so long as the pressure of the condensing gas is more than than the pressure of the liquid state of that gas (both at the same temperature).
Process in nature.
Condensation is vital in nature and is always the same as temperature and vapour pressure in nature. This means that if there is a lot of condensation, the temperature goes up. Alternatively, if there is hardly any condensation, there will be a temperature loss.
Process in industry.
It is a process that can be useful to man. One use is in the creation of “new water” (drinkable water made from drinkable sources).
Problems.
However, since there is a temperature gain when a lot of condensation happens, the heat needs to be "removed", which can be troublesome and expensive.
