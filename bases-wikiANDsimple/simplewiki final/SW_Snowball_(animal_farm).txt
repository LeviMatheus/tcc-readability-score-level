Snowball is a character in the book "Animal Farm". Like Napoleon, Snowball is a boar raised by Mr. Jones for sale. Unlike Napoleon, Snowball's plans and projects are targeted at improving the quality of Manor Farm. He is a vivacious pig, quick in speech, and a brilliant inventor.
Snowball is based on Trotsky of the Russian revolution, who was exiled by Stalin and the KGB (Stalin's secret police).
