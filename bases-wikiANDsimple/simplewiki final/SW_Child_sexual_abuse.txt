Child sexual abuse is when an adult or older teenager makes a child do any kind of sexual activities. It also happens when the adult or older teen asks a child to do any kissing, hugging or other sexual activities.
Child sexual abuse can harm a child emotionally, with various effects, and some of those effects can happen much later when the child is an adult. The effects can include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, an increased chance that other kinds of abuse can happen to the same person later, and physical injury can happen to the child. When a child is sexually abused by a family member, it is called "incest," and the effects can cause even more serious long-term psychological trauma, especially when the incest is done by a parent. Most but not all child sexual abuse is committed by pedophiles, adults who are sexually attracted to children more than to adults.
Child sexual abuse is not rare. Around a quarter of all women and a tenth of all men were sexually abused when they were children. For most children who are sexually abused, the person who abused them is somebody that they know. Around a third of child sexual abuse is done by a relative of the child, most often fathers, uncles or cousins. Strangers only do around a tenth of child sexual abuse cases, and the rest are done other acquaintances such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbors. Men are the offenders in the majority of child sexual abuse; women are the offenders in around 10% of the cases.
