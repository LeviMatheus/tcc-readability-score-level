Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (born Weimar 22 November 1710 â€“ died Berlin 1 July 1784) was a famous German composer and organist.
He was the son of Johann Sebastian Bach, but he was far different, especially his habits, which people didn't like.
When he was small his famous father taught him to play the harpsichord and organ. Johann Sebastian wrote some pieces for his son to play, and put them in a book called "Notebook for Wilhelm Friedemann Bach". The first ones are very easy, but they soon become very hard. This must mean that the young boy made very fast progress. He had a lot of talent which he did not use. He was a very good improviser, but was careless when playing music by other composers, including his father's.
In 1733, he was organist of St. Sophia's Church at Dresden, and in 1746 became organist of the Liebfrauenkirche at Halle. In 1764, after arguing with a lot of people, he left the job in Halle, remaining unemployed and living a life of poverty until his death.
Sadly for us, Wilhelm Friedemann Bach owned a lot of music which his great father had written. Unfortunately he seems to have lost it. So a lot of great music has been lost to the world.
