"Queer as Folk" is an American/Canadian television series that aired from 2000-2005 on Showtime. It is a remake of a British program with the same name. The series follows the lives of several gay men living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Due to the cost of making the series, it was actually filmed in Toronto, Canada. Following its first episode, the series quickly became the most-viewed program on the Showtime network in the United States, despite its somewhat controversial and graphic depictions of gay life.
