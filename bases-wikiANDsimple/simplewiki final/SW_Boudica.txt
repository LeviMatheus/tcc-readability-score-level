Boudica known by the Romans as Boudicea (died 60/61 AD) was the queen of Iceni people in the Eastern part of England.
Her husband was King. he was one of the Kings who tried to get along with the Romans as they invaded. When he died, the Romans ignored his will and stole Boudicca's lands and abused her and her two daughters.
She is most famous for leading her people in uprisings against the Roman Empire who controlled the island of Britain at the time. She first burnt Londinium (now London) to the ground and was some what successful in her efforts. However, hearing of this, the Romans gathered a larger army and there was a battle. Sensing that she was going to be defeated, Boudicca chose to commit suicide rather than be taken as a slave.
A statue of Boudica was put up in the Westminster area of London in 1902.
