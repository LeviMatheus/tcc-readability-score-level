Nuclear fission is when atoms split apart into smaller atoms. It gives off a lot of energy, and is used in nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors. This process was discovered in December 1938 by the German nuclear chemist Otto Hahn and his assistant Fritz Strassmann in Berlin.
Certain types of the elements named "uranium" and "plutonium" can be made to fission. All atoms are small, but atoms of uranium and plutonium are very heavy. At their center is a very heavy ball called a nucleus, which is made of protons and neutrons. If a very large nucleus is shot at with a neutron, it will sometimes break into two pieces. This will release a lot of energy, and also some more neutrons. If those neutrons then hit another atom, they will do the same thing, again and again. This is called a nuclear chain-reaction, and it can release a lot of energy very quickly. Forces are measured in kilotons. One kiloton is the same as the explosive force of one thousand tons of TNT (trinitrotoluene).
In a nuclear bomb, this must happen very quickly to make a very big explosion. In a nuclear reactor, this must happen very slowly to create heat. To create heat, uranium is used to boil water in the reactor.
In nuclear reactors, fission is used to create heat, which is used to make steam. The steam is then used to power electric turbines which generate electricity.
