Saskatchewan is a province of Canada. About 1 million people live in Saskatchewan. Most of its population lives in the southern part of the province. The primary industry in Saskatchewan is agriculture (farming), and the province is recognized by its wide horizons that stretch for miles (the land is really flat in the south, so you can see a very far way). There is a joke about the flat land in Saskatchewan: "My dog ran away last week." (The joke teller gazes out at the horizon.) "Yep, look at him go." Not all the land is flat prairie. There are beautiful scenic woodlands and forests in the central and northern regions and parklands with lakes for fishing. The province is punctuated by the North and South Saskatchewan rivers that run through it. The province is nicknamed "The Land of Living Skies". The largest city is Saskatoon followed by the province's capital, Regina. Saskatchewan is (approximately) a quadrilateral bounded on the west by Alberta, on the north by the Northwest Territories, on the east by Manitoba, and on the south by the American states of Montana and North Dakota. Saskatchewan was founded on September 1st, 1905.
