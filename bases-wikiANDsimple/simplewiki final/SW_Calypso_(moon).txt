Calypso is a small moon of Saturn. It was discovered by a few astronomers in 1980, based on observations from the Earth. It is named after Calypso in Greek mythology. Calypso is a Trojan moon, as it orbits together with larger moon Tethys. It orbits behind Tethys by 60 degrees in its orbit around Saturn. Telesto is another moon which shares Calypso's orbit.
