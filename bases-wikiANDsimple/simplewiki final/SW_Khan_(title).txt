"This article is about the title. For other uses, see Khan (disambiguation)."
Khan (sometimes spelled as "Xan", "Han", "Ke-Han", Turkic: "khān", Chinese:大汗) is an originally Central Asian title for a sovereign or military ruler.
It was used by the Mongols who brought it to all over Asia.
It now has many equivalent meanings such as commander, leader, or ruler. Presently Khans exist mostly in South Asia, Central Asia and Iran. The female alternative are Khatun and Khanum.
Ruling Khans.
A khan controls a khanate (sometimes spelled "chanat"). Whenever appropriate as ruler of a monarchy, Khan is also translated as king or prince. (But that translation is not quite correct.) Originally khans only headed relatively minor tribes.
The title Khan became well known when the tribal Mongol Temüjin proved himself a military genius by creating the Mongol Empire, the greatest land empire the world ever saw, which he ruled as Genghis Khan. His title was khagan 'Khan of Khans', see below, but is often 'shortened' to Khan (rather like the Persian "Shahanshah" -also meaning 'King of Kings'- is usually called Shah, equally incorrect, in most Western languages) or described as 'Great Khan' (like the Ottoman Padishah being called 'Great Sultan').
