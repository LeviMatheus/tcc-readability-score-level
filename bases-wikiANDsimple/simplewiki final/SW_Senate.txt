In a modern democracy, a senate is a group of people who are part of a legislature. A legislature passes or changes laws for their country, state, or other area. Members of a senate are called senators. Some legislatures have two groups of people (working in separate places) called "houses". A senate can be called a "House of Senators". The other house of such legislatures is called a "House of Representatives". In such legislatures, both houses must pass the same bill to make it a law. Examples of modern democratic areas having legislatures with senates are the United States of America (U. S.), Canada, and many states in the U. S. The senators are elected by citizens in areas the senators represent.
The first ever senate was the Roman Senate.
Senate is also the name of the ruling body of some universities.
