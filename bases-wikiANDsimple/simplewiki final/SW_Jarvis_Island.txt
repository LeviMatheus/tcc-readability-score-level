Jarvis Island is an island owned by the United States. It is "uninhabited", which means that nobody lives there. The small island is a part of the United States Minor Outlying Islands, a group of uninhabited islands.
Jarvis Island was officially made part of the United States in 1858. People used to mine guano there, but they then abandoned it. The United States treats it as a nature reserve.
