Joseph Conrad (3 December 1857 – 3 August 1924) (real name: "Józef Teodor Konrad Korzeniowski") was a Polish writer, regarded as one of the greatest English-language novelists. This is very remarkable, because he did not learn to speak English well until he was in his 20s and therefore always had a Polish accent.
People think Conrad's prose style is one of the best of all English novelists. He also is seen as important for paving the way to modernist literature. His narrative style and anti-heroic characters have influenced many modern writers and inspired such films as "Apocalypse Now" (after Conrad's "Heart of Darkness").
Conrad lived in the time of the British Empire and worked in the British Merchant Navy. So he had experience enough to write novels and short stories about empire and navy.
