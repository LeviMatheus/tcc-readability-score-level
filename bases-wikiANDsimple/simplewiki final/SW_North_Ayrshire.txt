North Ayrshire (Gaelic: "Siorrachd Inbhir Ã€ir a Tuath",) is one of 32 council areas of Scotland. It borders onto the areas of Inverclyde to the north, Renfrewshire to the north east, and East Ayrshire, and South Ayrshire to the East and South respectively.
The area was created in 1996 as a successor to the district of Cunninghame which covered exactly the same boundaries. The mainland portion of the council area has historically been part of a greater County of Ayr, however it also contains the islands of Arran, Great Cumbrae and Little Cumbrae in the lower Firth of Clyde. All the islands were previously in the County of Bute.
