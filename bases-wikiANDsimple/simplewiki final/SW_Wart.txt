Warts are growths on the skin. They are caused by a virus in the HPV family. They can be on the hands, feet, genital areas, or inside the mouth. Medication can be bought at a pharmacy to remove them but usually they will go away on their own. Warts are usually not dangerous to a person's health but they can be passed to other people.
Getting rid of warts.
The most common means of wart removal are available at pharmacies: These over the counter drugs are eiither special pads that contain salicylic acid, or as a solution that contains it. Getting rid of a wart that way involves cleaning the area around the wart, and treating it with the salicylic acid. This will slowly kill wart tissue. Dead tissue can then be scraped off. Getting rid of a wart that way can take up to 12 weeks.
