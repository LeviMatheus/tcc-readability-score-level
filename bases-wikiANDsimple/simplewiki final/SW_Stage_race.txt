A bicycle stage race is a race held over several days. Each day's race is called a "stage". Many countries have a racing tour of their country, for example the Deutschland Tour and the Tour of Britain. The oldest and most famous stage race is the Tour de France.
A stage race does not have to be tour of a country. The Bayern Rundfahrt is a stage race in Bavaria, Germany. In contrast the ENECO Tour is a stage race around Belgium and the Netherlands.
