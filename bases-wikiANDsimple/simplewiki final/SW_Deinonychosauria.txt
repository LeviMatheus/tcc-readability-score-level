The Deinonychosauria ("fearsome claw lizards") is a clade of theropods in the Late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.
Dromaeosauridae includes some of the most fearsome killers of the Cretaceous Period: Deinonychus, Velociraptor, and Utahraptor. The largest known of these was possibly Utahraptor, and Microraptor was among the smallest (40 cm or 16 in).
Troodontids date from the late Cretaceous Period and were lighter and slimmer than the dromaeosaurids. Some of these were Tro√∂don and Saurornithoides.
