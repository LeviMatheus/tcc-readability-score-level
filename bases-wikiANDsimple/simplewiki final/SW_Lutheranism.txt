Lutheranism is a denomination within the Christian religion.
The person who led the Lutherans in their break away from the Catholic Church was Martin Luther. Martin Luther began this break from the Catholic Church in the 16th century. Luther was a German priest and theologian. He worked to improve the practices of the Roman Catholic Church.
Lutheranism happened while Martin Luther and his followers began a big split from the Roman Catholic Church known as the Protestant Reformation. Lutherâ€™s ideas are said to be a large reason of the Protestant movement.
Lutherans believed the Bible is the one true book of faith. He believed God made the world, humanity included, perfect, holy and sinless, however Adam and Eve chose to disobey God, making all humans become sinners.
