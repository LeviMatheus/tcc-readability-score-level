The United States of America developed from the British colonies that argued against British tax with the phrase, "No taxation without representation". On July 4, 1776, people from 13 colonies signed the United States Declaration of Independence. This said from that point on, they were free and independent states, meaning they felt England wasn't under control. Britain tried to recapture the colonies in the American Revolutionary War, but they failed.
Beginnings.
In 1781, the colonies prepared a Union with the Articles of Confederation. But it only lasted six years. In 1787, a constitution was written. Very soon after, the Bill of Rights was added. This was a set of 10 "amendments" (changes), that limited the government's power and guaranteed rights to the citizens. The US Constitution has been changed and added to many times since then. The main idea is that the government is a representative democracy elected by the people, who all have the same rights. However, this was not true at first, when only white males who owned property could vote. This was only changed after the American Civil War, by the 13th, 14th, 15th, and 19th amendments.
The United States was mostly farm land before the industrial revolution around the mid 19th century. That led to enormous economic growth. Many new states were added to the original 13, as the nation grew.
But then a serious problem developed. Several southern states disagreed with the others about policies like slavery in the new territories, and how much power the states should have to make their own laws. They therefore created a confederation separate from the central government. The nothern states that still followed the national government were calles union states. The Civil War between these two groups lasted from 1861 until 1865. The union states won the war and slavery ended in the United States.
After the Civil War, there developed problems between the white settlers and the native Indians as more people began to move west. Because of this, many more Indians were killed.
After 1900.
In the 20th century, the US had more contact with other countries. In 1917, the US got involved in World War I and helped quickly defeat Germany and its allies, the Central Powers. After World War I, the United States was the world's second richest and most powerful country.
The Great Depression happened in the early 1930s, when a lot of people could not find a job. There were a lot of reasons for the Great Depression, but one of the main things that made it come as quickly as it did was the stock market crash of 1929, in which a lot of people lost a lot of money in a very short amount of time. Some people lost all their money in only a few days, since the stocks they had bought in the years leading up to it were now worth almost nothing.
In 1991, the US led other countries in what it calls the Persian Persian Gulf War, after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
On September 11, 2001, the United States was struck by a major terrorist attack. About 3,000 people died. Terrorists took control of four airplanes, in what is called a hijacking. They crashed all four of the planes on purpose.
Two of the planes crashed into the World Trade Center, a pair of skyscrapers in New York City. One plane crashed into the Pentagon, the main office for the U.S. military, in Virginia. The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after the passengers fought back.
Most of the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia and thought the US army should not be in Saudi Arabia, because they thought it was holy ground where only Muslims should be. A group called al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden, admitted they were behind these attacks, and they were based in Afghanistan, where they were supported by the Taliban Afghan government.
The attack led to big changes. The United States government responded by going to war against Afghanistan and driving out the Taliban. After that, it went to war against Iraq (2003 invasion of Iraq). The Iraq war was against the will of the majority of the world, because the Iraqi government was never involved with Afghanistan. The war caused massive demonstrations all over the world.
Immigrants from many nations now live in United States. Today's immigrants are mostly people from Latin America (especially Mexico) and Asia, with smaller groups of people from Europe and Africa.
