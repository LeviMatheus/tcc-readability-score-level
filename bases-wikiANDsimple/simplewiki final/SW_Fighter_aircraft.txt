Fighter aircrafts are small airplanes that are designed to fight other airplanes. They are often fast, having aerodynamic shapes (shapes that make them move through air easily) and very powerful engines for their size. They also tend to be maneuverable (turn well). Fighters can carry many different kinds of weapons, including missiles, machine guns, and bombs. While fighters may be used to attack vehicles, soldiers, or buildings on the ground, they are different from bombers because they are usually designed to attack other airplanes.
