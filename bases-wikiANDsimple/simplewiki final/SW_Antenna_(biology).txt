Antennae (singular antenna) are paired appendages connected to the front segments of arthropods. In crustaceans, they are found on the first two segments of the head. The smaller pair is known as antennules. Two arthropod groups, chelicerates and proturans, have no antennae.
Antennae are jointed and extend forward from the head. They are sensory organs. The organ may sense touch, air motion, heat, vibration (sound), and especially olfaction (smell) or gustation (taste).
