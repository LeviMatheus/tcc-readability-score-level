New Year's Eve is the holiday before New Year's Day, on December 31, the last day of the current year.
In modern times, Western countries usually celebrate this day with a party which culminates with a group countdown to the midnight hour. Party hats, noisemakers, fire crackers and drinking champagne are fairly common during this holiday.
Many municipalities also offer fireworks displays and other noisy ways to usher in the new year, at midnight. Places like Berlin, Chicago, Edinburgh, Los Angeles, London, New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Toronto, and Tokyo are well known for their New Year's Eve celebrations.
New Year's Eve is also a work holiday in some countries, such as Australia, Argentina, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Philippines, and Venezuela.
