Futurepop is an electronic dance music genre, incorporating influences from synthpop (like song structure and vocal style), uplifting trance (grandiose and arpeggiated synthesizer melodies), and EBM. The term was coined by Ronan Harris (of VNV Nation) and Stephan Groth (of Apoptygma Berzerk) while attempting to describe the style of music their bands produced.
