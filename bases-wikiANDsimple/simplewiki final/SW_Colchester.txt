History.
Before Roman times, Colchester was "Camulodunon". This is a Celtic name that came from Camulos. Camulos was the Celtic god of war. The Romans called Colchester "Camulodunum" (written "CAMVLODVNVM"). Colchester was attacked and burnt by Boudicca in 61 AD.
The church at the Benedictine abbey of Saint John the Baptist was destroyed in 1539. This was when King Henry VIII took the property of the Roman Catholic institutions in England. The only part left is a gate that people still go to visit.
King Cunobelinus (or "Cunobelin") was from Colchester.
