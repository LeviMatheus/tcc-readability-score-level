The Princess Helena (Helena Augusta Victoria: Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein by marriage; 25 May 1846 â€“ 9 June 1923) was the third daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Helena was interested in nursing, needlework and writing, and she founded several nursing hospitals. In 1866, she married Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, a minor German prince with very little money, and they lived near Queen Victoria in the United Kingdom. After Victoria's death in 1901, Helena and Christian lived in London and Windsor. Prince Christian died in 1916, shortly after their 50th wedding anniversary, and Helena died six years later.
