A fishing rod is a tool used for catching fish. This is the way people catch fish for fun or sport; commercial fishing is usually done using fishing nets.
A fishing rod is basically a line with bait on it, fixed on a pole. There is usually some way to make the line longer or shorter, and the pole it is fixed on can bend a little.
