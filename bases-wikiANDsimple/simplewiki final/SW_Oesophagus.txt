The oesophagus (also spelt esophagus and Å“sophagus), also called the gullet, is the part of the gastrointestinal system between the mouth and the stomach.
The oesophagus is lined with muscle. This muscle pushes the food bolus (ball) down into the stomach. The esophagus can contract or expand to allow for the passage of food.
