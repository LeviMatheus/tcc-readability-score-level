The Sri Maha Bodhi is a Sacred Fig tree in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka. It is said to be a tree grown from a seed from the famous Bodhi tree under which the first Buddha became enlightened. It was planted in 288 BC, and is the oldest living human-planted tree in the world with a known planting date.
It was planted on a high terrace about above the ground and surrounded by railings, and today it is one of the most sacred objects of the Buddhists in Sri Lanka and respected by Buddhists all over the world. This wall was built during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasingha, to protect it from wild elephants which might have attacked the tree.
