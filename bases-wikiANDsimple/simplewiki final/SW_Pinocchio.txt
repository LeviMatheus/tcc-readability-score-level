Pinocchio is a made up story person that first was told and printed in 1883, in the book "The Adventures of Pinocchio" by Carlo Collodi.
It is the story of a puppet who was made by woodcarver, Gepetto. The puppet, Pinocchio, learns about being a real life boy. He really wants to be a human being instead of being a puppet made of wood with strings. He is famous because when he tells lies, his nose grows much longer.
The most well-known version of the tale is the Disney animated movie from 1940.
