Holy Roman Emperor was the title that was given to the ruler of a loose group of places in what is now called Germany called the Holy Roman Empire. The title of "emperor" was passed from the Romans to the Frankish kingdom when, on 25 December 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne, king of the Franks, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.
