An Echidna also called "spiny anteaters", is a monotreme that lives in Australia and in New Zealand. They form the family Tachyglossidae.
Echnidas have a long, tube-like mouth with a sticky tongue, but they are also covered in spines. They are also called spiny anteaters. Echidnas are monotremes, which means they have mammary glands, but lay eggs too.
The echidna has a unique way of protecting itself. With its long, sharp claws, they quickly dig a hole until only their spines are accessible. The predator will not be able to get to it without injuring itself. Spiny anteaters eat ants. They also eat other small insects. Echidnas pick up the bugs with their sticky tongues.
