Tuvalu is a small island country in the Pacific Ocean. It used to be called Ellice Islands; it was part of Gilbert and Ellice Islands. It is a monarchy.
Tuvalu is getting smaller. If the sea level keeps rising at the same rate, this country will be covered by water in about 50 years.
The most important language spoken in Tuvalu is Tuvaluan.
The United States and Tuvalu signed a treaty of friendship in 1979, when the USA gave up its claim to the islands of Funafuti, Nukefetau, Nukulaelae, and Nurakita.
