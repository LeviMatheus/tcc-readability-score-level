The Mi'kmaq language (also spelled Míkmaq, Mi'gmaq, Mi'qmac, or priorly Micmac) is an Eastern Algonquian language spoken by nearly 9,000 Míkmaq in Canada, and another 1,200 in United States, out of a total ethnic Míkmaq population of roughly 40,000. The word "Míkmaq" is a plural word meaning 'my friends' (singular "Míkm"); the adjectival form is "Míkmaw". The language's native name is "Míkmawísimk" or "Míkmwei" (in some dialects).
Writing system.
Míkmaq is written with letters of the Roman alphabet. This writing system was created by missionaries in the 19th century. Before, the language was written in Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing, a script of partially-native origin.
