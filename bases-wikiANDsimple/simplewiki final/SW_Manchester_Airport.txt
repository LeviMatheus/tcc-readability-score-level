Manchester Airport is a major airport in Manchester, England. Opening to passenger traffic in June 1938, it was initially known as Ringway Airport. During World War II it officially became RAF Ringway, and from 1975 until 1986 the title Manchester International Airport was used. The airport complex is almost entirely located within the city of Manchester boundariesâ€”the exception being the second runway, which lies mostly in neighbouring Cheshire.
Manchester Airport competes with other airports nearby such as Liverpool Airport and Leeds Bradford Airport.
