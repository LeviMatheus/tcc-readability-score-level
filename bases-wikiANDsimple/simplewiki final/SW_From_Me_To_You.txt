"From Me To You" is a song by The Beatles, written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. It was their first big hit, staying on top of the chart for seven straight weeks. The part of the song, "dah dah dah dah dah dum dum dah," was not used at the time. It shows how smart the producer, George Martin, is.
