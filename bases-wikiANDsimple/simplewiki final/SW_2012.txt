2012 is a year in the 21st century. It is a leap year.
Events.
The Summer Olympic Games will take place in London. This is the third time the Olympics have been held in London.
2012 is also the predicted apocalypse. According to the ancient Mayan culture and long count calendar, on the 21st or 26th of December in 2012 the earth will be lined up with the center of the galaxy. According to the ancient Mayans this will cause the earths magnetic field to change resulting in many natural disasters.
The ancient Mayans believe that 13 crystal skulls should be reunited in order to discover the secret of surviving 2012. The skulls act just like the metallic compound in CD's containing information. Consider the skulls to be 13 cd's full of doomsday survival information, and if even one is missing, the data is not complete.
