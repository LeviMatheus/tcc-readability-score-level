Lebanonâ€“Pakistan relations are the relations between Lebanon and Pakistan. These relations have been good mainly because Pakistan, to a certain point, does not recognise Israel as a legitimate country. Trade between the two countries has more or less favoured Pakistan as Lebanon is not in a stable state. Due to the popularity of Arabic in Pakistan, Lebanese music and cuisine are widespread.
