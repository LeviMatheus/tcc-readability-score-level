William Blake (November 28 1757 â€“ August 12 1827) was an English poet, visionary, painter, and printmaker.
During his lifetime he was not very well known. Today Blake's work is thought to be important in the history of both poetry and the visual arts. His most famous poem is "And did those feet in ancient time" which, more than 100 years later, was put to music by Hubert Parry. The hymn is called "Jerusalem".
Blake was voted 38th in a poll of the 100 Greatest Britons organized by the BBC in 2002.
