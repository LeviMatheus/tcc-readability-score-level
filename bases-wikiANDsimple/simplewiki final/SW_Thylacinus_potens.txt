"Thylacinus potens" ("powerful thylacine") was one of the largest species from the family Thylacinidae, growing up to the size of a wolf. In some ways it was more robust and had a shorter, broader skull than the modern Thylacine. The head and body together were around 5 ft long. The fossils were found near Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia.
