An atoll is a kind of island. It is a coral reef that makes a ring, or part of a ring. There may be just water inside the atoll, or there may be one or more regular islands.
Charles Darwin, who is most famous for his theory of evolution, was the first person to find out how atolls form. He said that volcanoes in the ocean sometimes wear away or sink deeper. Coral growing on a volcano likes to be near the surface, and it keeps growing to stay there.
Most atolls are in the warm parts of the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.
