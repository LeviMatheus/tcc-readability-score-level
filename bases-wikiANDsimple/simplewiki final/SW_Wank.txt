Wank is a mountain in the Bavarian Alps, by Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany, close to the Austrian border.
Wank is 1780m tall, and has a cable car, the "Wankbahn", which takes people almost all the way to the top. Near the peak, there is an inn called the "Wankhaus" which was built in 1911 that allows people to spend the night.
