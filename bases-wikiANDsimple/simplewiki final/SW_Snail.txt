A snail is an animal. It is a mollusc, which means it does not have bones. Most snails are aquatic, they live in the water. Most of them have a shell. Most snails are herbivores, though some are omnivores. Fewer even are carnivores.
Snails without a shell are usually called "slug"s.
Snails move very slowly, and are sometimes used to represent "slow".
In some countries, like in France, people eat snails. They usually boil them in salt water, and add a garlic sauce.
