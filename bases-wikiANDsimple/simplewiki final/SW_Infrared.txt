Infrared (IR) radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation (a wave with electricity). The wave is longer than light which humans can see and shorter than microwaves. The name means "below red". The word "Infrared" is from the Latin "infra" ("below") and red, which has the longest wave for light. The infrared wave is between 750 nm and 1 mm.
