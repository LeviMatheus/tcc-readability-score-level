A boomerang is a flying tool. It used to be made of wood, but most of the modern boomerangs are made of other materials.
Most people know that Australian Aborigines used boomerangs for hunting. But the oldest boomerang was found in a cave in Poland and is more than 20'000 (twentythousand) years old. This kind of boomerangs do not return to the thrower, but they can fly longer distances and more stable than other things which can be thrown.
Nowadays boomerangs are used for recreation. Most of them do not have the classical shape of an "L". The modern boomerang is special in that it will return to the one who threw it, if it is thrown correctly.
There are a lot of boomerang clubs in many countries all over the world. These clubs organise workshops and tournaments. The best boomerang-throwers come from Australia, France, Germany, Switzerland and the United States of America.
