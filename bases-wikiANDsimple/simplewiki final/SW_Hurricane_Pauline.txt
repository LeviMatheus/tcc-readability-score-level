Hurricane Pauline was a destructive hurricane of the 1997 Pacific hurricane season and one of the deadliest.
Pauline formed in the eastern Pacific on October 6. It strengthened rapidly, reaching category four on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on the next day. After a brief period of weakening to a category three, it re-intensified back to a category four, moving roughly parallel to the Mexican coast.
Pauline then made landfall, slamming into Mexico. Heavy rains and high winds caused damage as the storm skirted the coast.
There were 300-400 deaths, and heavy damage to Acalpulco.
The name was retired and replaced by Patricia for the 2003 Pacific hurricane season.
