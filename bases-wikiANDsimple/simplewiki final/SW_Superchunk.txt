Superchunk is an American indie rock band. Superchunk first came together in 1989 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina with Mac McCaughan singing and playing guitar, Laura Ballance playing bass, Jack McCook playing guitar and Chuck Garrison playing drums. The members of the band are now Mac McCaughan, Laura Ballance, Jon Wurster playing drums and Jim Wilbur playing guitar.
Superchunk is well known for their style of loud and fairly simple songs that are about things that happen in ordinary life.
For their self-titled first album, Superchunk was signed to Matador Records. Starting with their next album, "No Pocky for Kitty", they have released all of their albums on a label they made themselves called Merge Records.
