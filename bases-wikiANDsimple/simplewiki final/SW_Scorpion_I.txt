Scorpion I was the first of two kings so-named of Upper Egypt during the Protodynastic Period. His name may refer to the scorpion goddess Serket.
He is believed to have lived in Thinis one or two centuries before the rule of the better known King Scorpion of Nekhen. To him belongs the U-j tomb found in the royal cemetery of Abydos where Thinite kings were buried.
