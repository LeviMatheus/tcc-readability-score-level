374 Burgundia is a common Main belt asteroid. It is classified as an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Auguste Charlois on September 18, 1893 in Nice.
Burgundia was long thought to be a member of the now non-existent Ceres asteroid family, but was found to be an unrelated asteroid on the basis of being made up differently (A Cellino et al "Spectroscopic Properties of Asteroid Families", in "Asteroids III", University of Arizona Press p. 633-643 (2002)).
