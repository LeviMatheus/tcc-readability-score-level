The Armenian-Tatar massacres (also known as the Armenian Tatar War and the Armeno-Tatar War) refers to the inter-ethnic conflict between the Armenians and the Caucasian Tartars (modern Azeris) in the Caucasus in 1905â€”1907.
The massacres started during the Russian Revolution of 1905, and claimed hundreds of lives. The most violent clashes occurred in 1905 in February in Baku, in May in Nakhichevan, in August in Shusha and in November in Ganja.
