Haiti is divided into 10 departments (French, "dÃ©partements"). When Haiti was the French colony of "Saint-Domingue", there were three provinces: North, South and West. Under Toussaint L'Ouverture, the provinces were converted into departments.
The departments are further divided into 41 "arrondissements", and 133 "communes".
