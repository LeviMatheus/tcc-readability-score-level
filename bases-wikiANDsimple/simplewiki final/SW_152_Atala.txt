152 Atala is a very big, dark main belt asteroid. It is a type D asteroid, meaning that it is made of carbon, organic rich silicates and possibly water ice.
It was found by brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on November 2, 1875, but finding the asteroid was credited to Paul. It is named after Atala, eponymous heroine of the 1801 novel by François-René de Chateaubriand.
An occultation of a star by Atala was seen from Japan on March 11, 1994. Other occultations have been seen as recently as 2006.
