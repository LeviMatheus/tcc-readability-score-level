Particle physics is the area of physics that studies what makes up matter and radiation. It is also called high-energy physics because many of the particles studied are not normally found in nature, but can be made by hitting particles together in a particle accelerator. The biggest particle accelerator in the world is the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Europe.
Most modern particle physics research looks at subatomic particles (particles smaller than atoms). These include protons, neutrons, electrons, photons and neutrinos.
The best theory of particle physics is called the Standard Model.
