A petabyte (PB) is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices. Petabytes hold 1000 terabytes (GB) or a thousand trillion (1,000,000,000,000,000) bytes.
Large organisations use petabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data. People at home probably don't use petabytes, they would use gigabytes, megabytes and occasionally kilobytes.
