Fibrous proteins, also called scleroproteins, are long filamentous protein molecules
Fibrous proteins are only found in animals.
Fibrous proteins form 'rod' or 'wire' -like shapes and are usually inert structural or storage proteins. They are generally water-insoluble.
Fibrous proteins are usually used to construct connective tissues, tendons, bone matrix and muscle fiber.
Examples of fibrous proteins include keratins, collagens and elastins.
