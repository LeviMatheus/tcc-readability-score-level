The Fall/Liberation of Sàigòn happened on April 30, 1975. It was the capture of Saigon (Vietnamese:Sài Gòn) by the National Front for the Liberation of Vietnam and the Vietnam People's Army, marking the end of the Second Indochina War. It also resulted in the name of Saigon being changed to Ho Chi Minh City, in honour of former President Ho Chi Minh.
