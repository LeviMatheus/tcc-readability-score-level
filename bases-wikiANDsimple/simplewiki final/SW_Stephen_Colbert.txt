Stephen Colbert is an American actor and comedian. He was born on May 13, 1964 in Washington, DC. He is the host of "The Colbert Report" on Comedy Central. Colbert uses a special form of comedy called satire to make fun of politicians and the news media.
On "The Colbert Report" (which he pronounces IPA: to make the words sound the same), he pretends to be a right-wing talk show host. He likes to ask his guests very embarrassing questions that make it seem that he is a serious far right-wing conservative who is also not very smart. In real life, Colbert is a liberal Democrat.
Many famous American politicians and people in the news media agree to appear on his show because it is very popular. Colbert started as a comedy writer and performer for many other programs, such as "The Daily Show" and the "Strangers with Candy" movie, both also on Comedy Central.
