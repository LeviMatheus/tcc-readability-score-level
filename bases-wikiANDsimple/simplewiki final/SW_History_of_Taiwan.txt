Taiwan (leaving out the Pescadores) was first populated by native Taiwanese people. In the 17 century, the Dutch took over southern Taiwan, and then Spain took over northern Taiwan. In 1642, the Dutch made Spain leave and took over northern Taiwan. In 1644, the Qing Dynasty had just started ruling China, and Ming Dynasty's courtier, Koxinga landed Taiwan, made the Dutch leave, and ruled Taiwan turned it into a place to resist the Qing Dynasty. This period is called "the period of Ming Zheng", or the Kingdom of Tungning, the Kingdom of Yanping. One year later, the Qing Dynasty ended the Kindom of Tungning. The Qing Dynasty ruled Taiwan for 212 years. Qing Dynasty lost the First Sino-Japanese War and gave Taiwan to Japan. Taiwanese people shortly created the Republic of Formosa that lasted for about one year. In 1945, the Republic of China won the Second Sino-Japanese War and won back Taiwan. Taiwan has since then been ruled by the Republic of China.
