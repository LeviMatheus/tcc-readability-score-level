Anne Redpath was a Scottish artist. She was born in Galashiels, Scotland in 1895. She died in 1965.
She was the daughter of a tweed designer. Her father's work had an effect on her use of color and texture in her paintings. "I do with a spot of red or yellow in a harmony of grey, what my father did in his tweed", she said.
