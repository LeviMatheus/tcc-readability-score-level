The President of the Bundesrat () is the speaker or chair of the Bundesrat, which is the upper house of the German parliament.
Each of the ministers president of the federal "Länder" (states) acts as the president of the Bundesrat for one year.
President of the Bundesrat can also acts as deputy to the Federal President if the Federal President is out of Germany or not able to act because of illness etc. If the Federal President dies or is removed from office the President of the Bundestag will act as President until a new president is elected, which must be within within thirty days.
Election.
The President of the Bundesrat usually is elected on the 1 November in one year, and serves until the 31 October in the next year. The Basic Law says, in Article 52.1, that "the Bundesrat elects its President for one year". However, in practice the presidency rotates among all Länder equally, in accordance with a predetermined order. The order changes sometimes, because the it depends on each state's population.
