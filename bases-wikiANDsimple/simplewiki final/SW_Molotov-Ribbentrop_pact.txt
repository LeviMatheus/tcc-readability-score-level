The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was signed by Vyacheslav Molotov (Russian foreign minister) and Joachim von Ribbentropp (German foreign minister) on 23 August, 1939. The pact promised that neither Russia nor Germany would attack the other. It also divided Poland between them.
However, a week after the pact (treaty) was signed, Hitler broke it in 1941. This began a series of conflicts that led to World War II.
