The Cessna 182, marketed under the name Skylane, is a four-seat, single-engine, light airplane. It has the option of adding two child seats, installed in the baggage area.
Introduced in 1956, the 182 has been produced in a number of variants, including a version with retractable landing gear, and is the second most popular Cessna model, after the 172.
