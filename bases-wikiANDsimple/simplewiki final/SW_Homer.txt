Homer is the name of the Greek poet who wrote the epic poems the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey". Not much is known about him, or even if he was a real person. Some people think it was really a group of people who made those poems. Other people think Homer was really a woman.
According to legend, Homer was a blind poet who lived in Ionia. It is thought that he lived in the 8th century BCE. Most modern scholars think the Iliad was written in the second half of the 8th century BCE.
