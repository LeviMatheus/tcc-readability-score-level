The Chicago Cubs are a Major League Baseball team that plays in Chicago, Illinois.
History.
The Cubs were started in 1869. Although they were a very successful team during their early years, the success did not continue into the later years. After 1908, the Cubs didn't win a Championship title.
The last time the Cubs appeared in the World Series (baseball's Championship game), was in 1945. They lost to the Detroit Tigers. The Cubs have come very close to making it to the World Series since then, but have had a mishap each time they came close.
Stadium.
When playing home games in Chicago, the Cubs play at Wrigley Field. The stadium was built in 1914 and has been the home playing field of the Cubs since 1916.
During games, the stadium is filled with Cubs fans, who are known for always cheering for their team, even if they are not winning. Even though the Cubs currently hold the record for the longest championship dry spell in all of American professional sports, their fans remain loyal to them.
The Billy Goat Curse.
The Chicago Tribune bought the team in the early 1980's. The name "Billy Goat " comes from a bar known to all reporters as Billy Goat's Tavern, located on lower Wacker drive in downtown Chicago. When this "curse" started to sell the Cubs all the main characters were conveniently dead.
During the 1945 World Series, a man by the name of Vasili "Billy Goat" Sianis attended Game 4 of the series with his pet goat. During the 7th inning of the game, the Stadium's security guards asked Sianis to leave the stadium because his goat was bothering other fans. Sianis became angry and cursed the Cubs, saying that they would never win a World Series as long as they played at Wrigley Field. Although the curse is often seen as a joke for most Cubs fans, some fans think it could be the reason why the Cubs have not won a World Series title.
