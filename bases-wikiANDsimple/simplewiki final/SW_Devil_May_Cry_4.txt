"Devil May Cry 4" is the latest video game in the series of "Devil May Cry". It was released on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on February 5 2008. Before to this game, all "Devil May Cry" games had only been released on the PlayStation video game consoles. This one was the first game to be relased on the Xbox as well as The PlayStation. In January, gamers could download a demo at the Playstation Store and Xbox Live Marketplace.
One big difference in this game is that Dante is no longer the main character. A new character named Nero is the new hero. Lady and Trish from older games return in this game. This game has more new characters, such as Kyrie, Credo, Agnus, Gloria, and Sanctus and new demons and bosses for the player to fight.
This game is just like the first games. It follows the usual "Devil May Cry" gameplay using a variety of melee and long-range weapons
