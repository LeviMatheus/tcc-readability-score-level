The Maya peoples form a diverse range of the Native American peoples of southern Mexico and northern Central America.
The most populations of Maya are in the Mexican states of Yucat√°n, Campeche, Quintana Roo, Tabasco, and Chiapas, and in the Central American countries of Belize, Guatemala, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador.
