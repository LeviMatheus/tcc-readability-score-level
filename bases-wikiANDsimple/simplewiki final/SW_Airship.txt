Airships are vehicles used to travel in the air. Airship can mean blimp, dirigible or balloon. (Some people may say "airship" meaning airplane, jet, helicopter or other aircraft.)
Blimps.
A blimp is a balloon with a motor. Blimps can be up to hundreds of meters long and very tall. The helium inside them keeps them up in the air and the propellers can push it through the air.
Dirigibles.
A dirigible is an airship with a rigid frame. A Zeppelin is a type of dirigible. The most famous Zeppelin was the Hindenburg. It crashed when it was landing. Many people died.
