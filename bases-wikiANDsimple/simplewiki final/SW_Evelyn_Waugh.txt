Evelyn Waugh (pronounce like the word "war"), (born 28 October 1903; died 10 April 1966) was an English writer. He is well known for his satirical novels which include "Decline and Fall", "Vile Bodies", "Scoop", "A Handful of Dust" and "The Loved One", and especially for "Brideshead Revisited" and the "Sword of Honour" trilogy. When he was writing these novels he used experiences that he had in his own life. He often describes British aristocracy and high society, making satirical fun of them. However, in his real life he was also attracted to them.
His travel writings and his diaries and letters have also been published.
