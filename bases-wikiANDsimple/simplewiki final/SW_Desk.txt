A desk is a piece of furniture where someone can sit and write, often with drawers or other places to put books, papers, and other things. Unlike a table, there is only one side of the desk where somebody could sit.
Desks come in many different sizes. There is a Armoire desk, which is very big. There is also a portable desk which is very small. Desks can be used at home. They can also be used in an office.
A computer desk will have a computer on top. The keyboard and mouse will pull out from underneath the desk.
