Thrymr or Saturn XXX, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Gladman, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000 S 7.
Thrymr is about 5.6 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 20,810,000 km in 1120.809 days, at an inclination of 175° to the ecliptic (151° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.453.
Thrymr may have formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe at some point in the past.
Its name comes from Norse mythology, where Thrymr is a Jotun or frost giant.
The name was said as Thrym in. However, the IAU Working Group on Planetary System Nomenclature later decided to add the nominative case ending "-r" to the root "Thrym".
