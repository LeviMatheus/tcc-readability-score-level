The Class 125 was a design of three car Diesel Multiple Unit built for British Rail in 1958. They were high-density units, externally very similar to the Class 116. They were built specifically for the Lea Valley Line, were all withdrawn in 1977, and none survive to this day. Like many first-generation DMU classes, they never carried their 125xxx TOPS set numbers.
