The 2003 invasion of Iraq (March 20, 2003 - present) means the war waged by the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and some other countries against Iraq, to end the rule of Saddam Hussein. The main reason that the war started was the United States thought that Iraq had dangerous weapons of mass destruction that they were not telling the truth about. Many people thought that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the leaders of Al-Qaeda, was hiding in Iraq after the September 11, 2001 attacks. Though Saddam Hussein was not involved in the planning of the September 11 attacks, many people accused him of giving Al-Qaeda a safe place to hide from the United States.
