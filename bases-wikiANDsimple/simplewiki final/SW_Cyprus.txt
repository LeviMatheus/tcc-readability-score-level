Cyprus is a country in Asia, that is often counted as part of Europe for reasons of culture and history. It is an island in the Mediterranean Sea. The capital is Nicosia. Most of the population speaks Greek, but the north of the island is ruled separately and is Turkish-speaking. In July 1974 Turkey liberated the north of Cyprus after Greek rebellion groups working for the government started wide spread violence against the Turkish community to destroy the large minorities and unite the island with Greece under a campaign known as ENOSIS, first brought forward by Greek ruler Makarious, an orthodox Greek Christian. Originally, the Turkish Ottoman Empire had control of Cyprus, before temporarily renting it to the British to pay off debts. The land was not returned after Britain declared war on Turkey, in which Turkey became victorious and established an independent republic under the first president Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. The South side of Cyprus, currently being occupied by the Greeks, is part of the European Union, in which Turkey and the Northern Turkish republic of Cyprus is seeking membership in also.
