In computer science, speculative execution is the execution of code, before being sure if the result will be needed.
The technique is used in most high-performance microprocessors to execute a complete instructions or parts of instructions before being sure whether this execution is required
In the context of functional programming, the term "speculative evaluation" is used instead.
