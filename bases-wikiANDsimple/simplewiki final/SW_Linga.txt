A linga or a lingam is a very complex symbol of Hinduism. It is associated with Shiva, one of the three main gods of the Hindus. A linga looks like a phallus. The Hindu scriptures say that a linga represents energy and strength. In almost all the temples of Shiva, Shiva is shown in the form of a linga.
Beside above places, in almost all the towns and villages of India, Shivaâ€™s temples are found. In all such temples, lingas are worshipped.
