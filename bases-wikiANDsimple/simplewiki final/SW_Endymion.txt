Endymion is a human character in Greek mythology.
His story is told by various ancient authors. In most versions he is a shepherd, and a young man of unusual handsomeness â€” so much so that the Moon goddess Selene falls in love with him. She uses her divine power to keep him asleep forever, preserving his youth and beauty.
The Endymion story has been re-told by poets and playwrights. The English playwright John Lyly wrote one version; and the poet John Keats used the story as the basis for his long poem "Endymion".
