Biography.
Farrell was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, but when he was five he moved to Mission Viejo, California where he attended Mission Viejo High School. He graduated in 1999 at the University of California, Los Angeles. He can play bass guitar, electric guitar, cello and violin.
Farrell was a member of a Christian punk/ska band called Tasty Snax. While he was at the college, he shared the room with his friend Brad Delson, and they practiced together.
Unfortunately, he had to go in tour with the Tasty Snax so he couldn’t play with Delson and his band. Then, Farrell left his band to play bass with Linkin Park. Farrell's fellow band mate Mark Fiore became Linkin Park's videographer.
