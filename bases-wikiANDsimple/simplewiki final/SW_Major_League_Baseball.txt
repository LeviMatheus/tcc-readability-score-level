Major League Baseball is the company in the United States and Canada that is in charge of professional baseball. Both the American League, also called AL, and National League, also called NL, are part of the company. Even though it is named "major league" (high group), the company is also in charge of much of the minor league (low group) of baseball. The company owns everything that happens in major league baseball games. It also includes MLB Productions and MLB Advanced Media, which are in charge of major league baseball games on television and the teams and company web pages. There are 30 different major league teams.
At the end of every season, the best teams play a World Series. The best teams are chosen by the best teams in the west, central, or east from each division (AL and NL) plus one extra team from both AL and NL (called the wild card) that's the best out of all of the remaining teams of the division. Teams then play "best out of 7" games in their own division. The teams that lose are out of the World Series, and this process continues until there is only one AL team and one NL team. These teams play the final "best out of 7" games and the winner of the games win the World Series.
