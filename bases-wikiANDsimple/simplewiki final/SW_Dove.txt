A dove or pigeon is a bird of the family "Columbidae". The birds can be found worldwide, but the greatest variety is in the areas around Indonesia and Australia. The young doves and pigeons are called "squabs." There are over 300 species of doves.
Pigeons and doves are thick-bodied birds with short necks and short narrow bills. The species commonly referred to just as the "pigeon" is the wild Rock Pigeon, common in many cities.
The nests of doves are usually made of sticks. Their two white eggs are incubated by both the male and the female. Doves feed on seeds, fruit and plants. Unlike most other birds, the doves and pigeons produce a type of milk. Both sexes create this highly nutritious milk to feed to the young.
As a symbol.
In Genesis, Noah released a white dove to find land after the flood. The dove returned with an olive branch. Usually, a white dove with an olive branch in its beak means peace and love.
