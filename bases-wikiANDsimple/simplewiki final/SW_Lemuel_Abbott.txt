Lemuel Abbott (c. 1730 â€“ April, 1776) was an English priest and poet. Little is known of his background, but he worked as a priest in Ansty, Leicestershire and Thornton. He is known mostly for his collection of poems called "Poems on Various Subjects, whereto is Prefixed a Short Essay on the Structure of English Verse", published in 1765. Abbott and his wife Mary were probably the parents of the artist Lemuel Francis Abbott.
