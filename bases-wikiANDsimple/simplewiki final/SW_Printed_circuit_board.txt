A circuit board is a card made specially for attaching electronic components. Circuit is the name for something which is looped. Electricity flows through a circuit board in different loops. The most common circuit boards are called PCBs (printed circuit board) and are most commonly mass produced ready for a specific job. Some circuit boards are made plain and a person can scrape the copper to suit the job they need. Inside the card is copper for connecting the electricity between the electronic components. The electronic components are soldered on (similar to welding). Soldering is a way of melting metal so that it drips on and sticks. Soldering on circuit boards is done with a very soft metal that can be melted again to remove components without damaging anything. Most things that use electricity have at least one circuit board inside.
Circuit testing.
Other circuit boards for testing components are called bread boards. Bread boards are not soldered. Components are clipped on to a bread board for testing and can be unclipped and removed.
