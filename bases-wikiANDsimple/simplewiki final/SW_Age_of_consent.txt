If two people want to have sex, law says that they must have a certain "age". This is called the age of consent. At that age, law says that the people are mature enough to decide for themselves if they want to have sex with each other.
The age of consent varies between states and countries, but it is usually around 12-18 years.
If a person is caught having sex with someone who is below the age of consent, he or she may be punished as a sex offender. They may have to serve a prison sentence.
