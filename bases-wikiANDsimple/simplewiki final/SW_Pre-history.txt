The word pre-history comes from the Ancient Greek words προ = before and ιστορία = history. Someone called Paul Tournal first used the French word Pré-historique. He found some things from pre-history in some caves in France. The word was used in France since the 1830s to talk about the time before writing. Daniel Wilson used it in English in 1851.
It means the time before people made writing. Things from pre-history are called "pre-historic." Pre-history can start at the start of the universe but the word more often means a time when there was life on Earth; dinosaurs are called prehistoric animals and cavemen are called prehistoric people. A very small amount is known about pre-history because it was not written down by the people who lived then. What we do know about pre-history we know because of things like tools, bones, and pictures in caves. Pre-history ends at different times in different places when people make writing.
In pre-history people lived in groups called "tribes" and lived in caves or tents (houses made from animal skin). They had simple tools made from bones and sticks that they used to hunt and to make simple things. They made fire from stones and they used fire to cook food and to keep warm. They made clothes out of animal skins that they used to keep warm. Society started when people started to do individual jobs. This is called the division of labor. The division of labor made people to depend on one another and led to advanced civilizations.
Some important sciences that are used to find out things about pre-history are palaeontology, astronomy, biology, geology, anthropology, and archaeology.
