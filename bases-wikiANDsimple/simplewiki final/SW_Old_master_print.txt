An old master print is a work of art made by a printing process. Most of the old master prints were made by 1830 and no new ones came after. The main techniques used to make an old master print are woodcut, engraving and etching. Sometimes, old master prints are printed on paper, but rarely.
Many great European artists, such as Albrecht DÃ¼rer, Rembrandt, and Francisco Goya, were printmakers.
