306 Unitas is a common Main belt asteroid. It is classified as an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Elia Millosevich on March 1, 1891 in Rome. It was second of the two asteroids he found. The other was 303 Josephina.
Although 306 Unitas has an orbit similar to the Vesta family asteroids, it was found to be an unrelated asteroid on the basis of its non-matching spectral type.
