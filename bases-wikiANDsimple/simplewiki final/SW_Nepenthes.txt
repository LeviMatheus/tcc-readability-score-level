The "Nepenthes", often know as "Tropical Pitcher Plants" or "Monkey Cups", are a genus of carnivorous plants in the family of the Nepenthaceae where we can find about 120 species (this number is fast increasing, with one to two new species being described each year). Numerous natural and many cultivated by the men. These kind of plants come from South China, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines; westward to Madagascar and the Seychelles; southward to Australia and New Caledonia; and northward to India and Sri Lanka. Many are plants of hot humid lowland areas, but the majority are tropical montane plants, and for to live they need warm days but cold and humid nighs. The name "Nepenthes" was first published in 1737 in Carolus Linnaeus's "Hortus Cliffortianus". Nepenthes are plants that need to eat insects from their pitches, they can catch, little spiders,mosquito, and sometimes maggots. The traps contain a fluid of the plant's own production, which may be watery or syrupy and is used to drown the insects. The trapping efficiency of this fluid remains high, even when significantly diluted by water, as inevitably happens in wet conditions. When the insects is inside the trap for it, it's impossible to escape. "Nepenthes" usually produce two types of pitchers. Near the base of the plant are the large lower traps, which typically sit on the ground, while the upper pitchers may be smaller, coloured differently, and have different features than the lower pitchers.
The lower part of the trap contains glands which take nutrients from captured insects.
One of the earliest pictures of "Nepenthes" appears in Leonard Plukenet's "Almagestum Botanicum" of 1696. The plant, called "Utricaria vegetabilis zeylanensium", is without doubt a "N. distillatoria".
