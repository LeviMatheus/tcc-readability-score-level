Bullets are small metal objects fired from guns. They are usually made from lead, and are propelled by a small explosion. A special powder named gunpowder is put inside the shell and makes the explosion which causes the bullet to be proppelled forward. The bullet is put on top of the shell, so that when the gunpowder explodes, the bullet is forced out at high speed. Bullets are used for many methods but mostly as a weapon in war and for shooting targets as a sport.
