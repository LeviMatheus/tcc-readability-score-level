A suspension bridge is a type of bridge that has been made since ancient times as early as 100 AD. Simple suspension bridges, for use by pedestrians and livestock, are still constructed, based upon the ancient Inca rope bridge.
Suspended from two high locations over a river or canyon, simple suspension bridges follow a shallow downward arc and are not suited for modern roads and railroads.
The design of the modern suspended-deck suspension bridge was developed in the early 19th century.
