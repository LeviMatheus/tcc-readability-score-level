Izumo (Japanese: 出雲国; "Izumo-no-kuni") was an old province of Japan. The territory of Izumo today is part of Shimane prefecture in the Chūgoku region. The origin of the word "Izumo" is from the name of the goddess Izanami. Legends tell she is the mother of Japan, and that she is buried on Mt. Hiba, at the border of the old provinces of Izumo and Hoki, near modern day Yasugi of Shimane Prefecture. By the tradition of Kojiki, the entrance to Yomi (the Japanese Hell) is also believed to be located in Izumo province.
