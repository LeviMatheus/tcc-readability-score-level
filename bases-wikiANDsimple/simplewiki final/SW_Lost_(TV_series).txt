"Lost" is an American television series that follows the lives of plane crash survivors on a tropical island, somewhere in the South Pacific. Each episode has a story from a character's past or future. The show was created by J. J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Jeffrey Lieber. It is mostly filmed in Oahu, Hawaii. The first episode was shown on September 22, 2004. Since then, four seasons have aired. The show is produced by ABC Studios, Bad Robot Productions and Grass Skirt Productions and airs on the ABC Network in the United States. Because of its large cast and the cost of filming in Hawaii, the series is one of the most expensive on television.
"Lost" had an average of 15.5 million viewers per episode on ABC during its first year, and won many awards including the Emmy Award for outstanding drama series in 2005 and best American import at the British Academy Television Awards also in 2005.
In May 2007 it was announced that "Lost" will continue for a fourth, fifth, and sixth year, with the final episode showing in May 2010. The announcement said that three final seasons will each have 16 episodes, running weekly in the spring without repeats. Season 4 began airing January 31, 2008. When the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, only 8 of the planned 16 episodes had been filmed. After the writer's strike was resolved, it was announced that only 5 of the remaining 8 episodes in season 4 will be filmed. It is expected that the 3 missing episodes will be added to seasons 5 and 6.
