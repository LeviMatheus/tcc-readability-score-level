Ornithomimus was a dinosaur that could run very fast. It usually ate meat.
Appearance.
The Ornithomimus had three toes on each foot, it also had long arms and a long neck, but a small head. It also had claws on each hand and foot. It had sharp teeth because it ate meat and plants.
It was 12 ft (3.5 meters) long, 7 feet (2.10 meters) high and weighed about 100-150 kg. It walked on two legs and looked slighty like an ostrich, except for its long tail. But, like an ostrich, it would have been able to run very fast.
