A needle is a small tool used to push or pull a thread through a small hole.
It is most often used to make clothing and footwear.
The needle consists of a short stick with a sharp point at one end and hole for the thread at the other end. Needles are now mostly made of steel, but in ancient or Stone Age times they would have been made of small bones or twigs.
Once the thread is put through the hole in the needle and "doubled-back" so that it cannot fall out, then the whole needle and its thread can be put through the material.
