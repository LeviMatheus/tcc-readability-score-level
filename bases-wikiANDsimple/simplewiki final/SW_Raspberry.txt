A raspberry is an aggreate fruit, meaning it is many fruits joined together.
It typically grows in forest clearings or fields where fire or wood-cutting has produced open space. The raspberry flower can be a source of nectar for honeybees. As a cultivated plant in moist temperate regions, it is easy to grow. It has a tendency to spread unless cut back.
Two types of raspberries can be bought in stores: the wild summer-bearing type, which produces fruit in the summer, and double- or "ever"-bearing plants, which also bear fruit in the summer.
Leaves of the raspberry are used fresh or dried in herbal teas. Leaves are found in groups of 3 or 5, and the undersides are silver-white in color. Blackberries have leaves that look similar to raspberry leaves, but the undersides are green.
