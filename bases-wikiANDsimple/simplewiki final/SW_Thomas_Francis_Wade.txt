Sir Thomas Francis Wade (25 August, 1818–31 July, 1895) was a London-born British diplomat and sinologist who produced a syllabary in 1859 that was later amended, extended and converted into the Wade-Giles Romanization for Mandarin Chinese by Herbert Giles in 1892. His Chinese name was Wei Tuoma (威妥瑪).
