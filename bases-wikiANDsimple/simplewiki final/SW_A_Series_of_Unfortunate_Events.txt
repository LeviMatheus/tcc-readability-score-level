"A Series of Unfortunate Events" is a series of thirteen books written for children by Lemony Snicket. They tell the story of 3 unlucky orphans (Violet Baudelaire, Klaus Baudelaire, and Sunny Baudelaire) and their lives after the death of their parents. The main villain of the books is Count Olaf who wants to steal Baudelaires' inheritance (the money their parents left behind). Count Olaf uses many disguises to get their fortune.
In 2004, there was a movie version from Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon movies, starring Jim Carrey as Count Olaf.
