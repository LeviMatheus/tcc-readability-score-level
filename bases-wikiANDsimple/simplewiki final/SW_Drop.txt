A drop is a small bit of liquid, such as water, which is held together by surface tension.
They are normally thought of as falling.
Something that is dropping can sometimes be called dripping.
Drops are often circular in shape, and sometimes when light is refracted through them, it makes a rainbow effect. Rain is an example of when drops fall. Drops are also like bubbles, except they hold liquid instead of a gas, like air.
