Condom (also Condom en Armagnac) is a commune in the south of France. Currently about 7.500 people live in the city.
The city lies on one of the pilgrims passages to Santiago de Compostela.The city lies on the via podiensis. It has a very prominent (gothic) cathedral. It has also made itself a name with the production of Armagnac, a kind of brandy. It is also one of the biggest communes of France, measured by surface area.
Despite naming similarities, the condom was neither invented nor developed in Condom-en-Armagnac. There is a museum about condoms there, though.
