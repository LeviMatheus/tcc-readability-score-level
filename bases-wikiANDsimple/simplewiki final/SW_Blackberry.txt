The blackberry is well known shrub. It grows to about 3 m in height. It produces an edible black fruit, known by the same name. The plant tolerates poor soil very well. It is very pervasive. It will grow fast, taking over uncultivated spots very fast. The black, juicy plump ones taste sweeter than the pre-mature blackberries (the red ones).
