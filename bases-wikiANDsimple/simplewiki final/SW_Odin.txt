In Norse mythology, Odin was the king of the Ã†sir. He is a god of war, but also associated to wisdom, poetry, and magic. Odin rides on an eight-legged horse called Sleipnir, and his famous spear is called Gungnir. He also has an precious arm ring called Draupnir, and two ravens called Hugin and Munin who tell him all the things happening around the world. Odin only has one eye, because he sacrificed one to drink from the fountain of wisdom.
Half of the souls of heroes slain in battles will be guided by the Valkyries, battle maidens, to Odin's hall, Valhalla. The other half belongs to the goddess Freyja.
His wife is Frigg and Jord, the Earth. His eldest son is Thor, god of thunder.
Odin would be swallowed by Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir at Ragnarok.
