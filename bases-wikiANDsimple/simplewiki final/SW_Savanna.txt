The word savanna comes from the term for plains.
They are covered with tall grasses. They may have an open bush layer, but not too many trees. The savannas' climate is often tropical wet and dry. Temperatures can reach up to 64Â°.
The world's greatest diversity of animals is found on the savannas of Africa. Some herbivores found in the savanna are antelopes, impalas, gazelles, buffalos, wildebeests, zebras, rhinos, giraffes, elephants, and warthogs. There is also a large number of carnivores, including cats (lions, leopards, cheetahs, servals), dogs (jackals, wild dogs), and hyenas. The vegetation in the Eastern African is also rich with grass and some scattered trees.
