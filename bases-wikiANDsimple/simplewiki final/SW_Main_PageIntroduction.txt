This is the front page of the Simple English Wikipedia. "Wikipedias" are places where people work together to write encyclopedias in different languages. We only use simple English words and grammar here. The Simple English Wikipedia is for everyone! That includes children and adults who are learning English.
There are articles on the Simple English Wikipedia. All of the pages are free to use. There is a discussion in the "GNU Free Documentation License". You can help here! You may change these pages and make new pages about whatever you want. Read the help pages and other good pages to learn how to write pages here.
