Computers can be part of several different networks. Networks can also be parts of bigger networks. The "local area network" in a department store is usually connected to the "corporate network" of the parent company, and may have privileges with the corporate network of a bank. Any connected machine at any level of the organization may be able to access the "Internet", for example to demonstrate computers in the store, display its catalogue through a web server, or convert received orders into shipping instructions.
Microsoft Windows, Linux and most other operating systems use IP for networking. Apple Macintosh computers used Appletalk in the past, but it uses IP now.
