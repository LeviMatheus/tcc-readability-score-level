The British Rail Class 02 were a class of twenty 0-4-0 diesel-hydraulic shunting locomotives. They were built by the Yorkshire Engine Company in 1960 (first ten, D2850-D2859) and 1961 (D2860-D2869). They were built for use in places of restricted loading gauge and curves such as docks. They had the door to the cab at the rear, with a railed veranda behind the cab. This feature was very unusual on British Rail locomotives. It was used on many Yorkshire Engine Co. designs and was/is quite normal in North American practice.
