Pterodaustro was a pterosaur from South America, are living from Cretaceous period. Pterodaustro most likely fed on tiny invertebrates: zooplankton and krill. Interesting enough, flamingos derive their pink colour from pigments found in these invertebrates (the pigments are actually found in algae, which the invertebrates consume).
Pterodaustro was medium sized, having a wing-span about two meters in length and having only been found in Brazil.
