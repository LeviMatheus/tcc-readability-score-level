Weather tells us what is happening in the sky above us. Weather includes wind, lightning, storms, hurricanes, tornados, rain, hail, and snow. Energy from the sun affects the weather.
Climate tells us what kinds of weather usually happens in an area at different times of the year.
Changes in weather can affect our mood. We wear different clothes and take part in different activities under different weather conditions. We choose different foods in different seasons.
Weather stations around the world measure different parts of weather. Ways to measure are wind speed, wind direction, temperature, barometric pressure, and humidity. People try to use these measurements to determine what the weather will be like in the future. These people are called "meteorologists".
