SecurDisc is a hard- and software based
security technology for CD’s/DVD’s, which was developed by Hitachi-LG
Data Storage and Nero AG. SecurDisc provides a full
range of powerful security features to protect data stored on optical media
against copying, unauthorized access and it helps to recover data in the event
of disc failure. SecurDisc also helps to ensure the
integrity and reliability of data stored on CDs and DVDs over long periods of
SecurDisc’s security features.
SecurDisc has five security features: data reliability, password protection,
data integrity check, digital signature and copy protection
Data reliability.
SecurDisc significantly increases the chances for
restoring files on failed, for example scratched discs.
Normally, when data is recorded to
optical media, for example CD’s/DVD’s, the discs rarely consume their maximum capacity.
Therefore often a large amount of space remains unused.
SecurDisc uses this remaining free space in
order to store information about the data written on the disc. In the
event of disc failure, these additional information are used by SecurDisc to rescue the data on the damaged parts of
Password protection.
SecurDisc protects confidential data by using
AES-128 encryption. Nobody can access the protected data without the
password set by the original author of the data disc.
When a user wants to access the
password-protected data on the disc, he is asked for the password by a password
prompt. Then, the password is passed through a secure channel to the drive.
After that, the password is checked by the drive. If it is the correct one, the
drive grants access to the data, stored on the disc. SecurDisc is a hardware-software based solution, and is
therefore more difficult to hack and more secure then software-only solutions.
secured by the strong AES-128 encryption and additionally
by secret values stored in the firmware of the drive. This combination provides for
Data integrity check.
SecurDisc uses a data integrity check in
order to warn the user in the case of the risk of loss of data due to disc
decay. So the user notices that his data on the disc are not save anymore and has
enough time to back it up to another disc. For this data integrity check SecurDisc uses its checksum feature.
Digital Signature.
sign an entire disc using a trusted signing key. Therefore another user can
verify the authenticity of the data using the signature verification key
distributed by the author of the disc. A private key is used for the digital
signature, and the recipient verifies it using the corresponding public key, which is the signature verification key. So both users can be sure that it is the
the original disc from the author.
Copy Protection.

Special equipment needed for SecurDisc.
In order to use the features

and any common writable CD/DVD. The required private-public key pair for the
Digital Signature can be also created by Nero Express, if someone does not
have such a key pair already.
Accessing a data disc with SecurDisc copy-protection.

and SecurDisc viewer is needed as well.
Accessing a non SecurDisc copy-protected SecurDisc data disc.
For accessing a non SecurDisc copy-protected SecurDisc
data disc, you need InCD Reader and any common disc

Using SecurDisc.
SecurDisc can be used for business as well as for personal matters.
Business partners can use SecurDisc for securing confidential data with the SecurDisc password protection feature.
Furthermore SecurDisc is a possible solution for data privacy problems.
Also SecurDisc can be used by personal users for e.g. permanent data storage on optical media i.e. CD's/DVD's.
Using SecurDisc for business matters.
Business partners can use SecurDisc for securing confidential data with the SecurDisc password protection feature.
Therefore they only need to burn data to CDs/DVDs using Nero Express
and a SecurDisc drive, and activate the password
needs just the password and the InCD Reader to access
They can also use the digital
signature feature to be sure that the discs they exchange are authentic and
have not been altered accidentally or even maliciously.
Using SecurDisc for personal matters.
SecurDisc can be used by personal users for permanent data storage on CD's/DVD's.
Hobby photographers (as well as professional photographers) can use a SecurDisc-enable drive to record their data to optical media
in order to preserve the quality and readability of their photos. This is
managed by the data integrity feature built into SecurDisc,
which protects the images against disc decay, which can harm the readability of
