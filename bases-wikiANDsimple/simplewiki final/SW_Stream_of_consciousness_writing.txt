Stream of consciousness is a term used in literary criticism for a literary technique that reports thought processes of a person.
That can be done either in context with observation of the surrounding world or without such observations, then it is called interior or internal monologue. Stream-of-consciousness writing is typical for the modernist movement. The introduction of the term to describe literature, transferred from psychology, is attributed to May Sinclair.
