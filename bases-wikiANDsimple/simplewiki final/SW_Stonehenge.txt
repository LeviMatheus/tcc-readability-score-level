Stonehenge is a site in Wiltshire, England. It is made of earth and stones standing in circles. It was built between 2640 and 2480 B.C and used until 3500 years ago. No one knows who built it or why they built it. During the summer solstice, the sunrise lines up with some of the stones. It is made out of a hard stone called "sarsen". In Egypt and South America, similar very old buildings can be found. They also show the time of the solstice. Stonehenge might therefore have been a kind of calendar for those ancient nations. At that time, religion and astronomy were fully mixed. Dead people were buried there so it was a kind of cemetery. Some people claim that it has magic powers.
Stonehenge itself is owned by the Crown and managed by English Heritage while the surrounding land is owned by the National Trust.
