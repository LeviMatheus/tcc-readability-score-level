History.
The Middle East Airlines opened for business on May 31, 1945. It was done so by Saeb Salam, with support from BOAC. MEA's work started on January 1, 1946 with a service between Beirut and Nicosia. Then, its airplanes started to fly to Iraq, Egypt, Syria, and Cyprus. The company bought two Douglas DC-3 planes in mid-1946.
On September 7, 2006, Israel ended its 8-week long air blockade on Lebanon. A Middle East Airlines plane from Paris flew to the Rafik Hariri International Airport at 6:06 p.m. Lebanese time (3:03 p.m. GMT). MEA resumed its normal flight timetable on September 11, 2006.
