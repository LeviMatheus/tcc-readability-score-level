The Black Sea is a sea surrounded by land. It is between Europe and Asia and is linked to the Mediterranean by the narrow Bosphorus.
"Upper sea" and/or "Kardunia's sea" is an old name of the sea called the Black Sea in later centuries. Though "Black" is inappropriate to its azure blue waves and the name Black Sea has been denounced in the society and in the poem of Pridon Khalvashi from Sakartuelo i.e. Georgia in 1975, that name is still used.
