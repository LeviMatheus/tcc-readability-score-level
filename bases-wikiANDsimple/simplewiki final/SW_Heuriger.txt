Heuriger is a word that describes the wine of the current year, and the places who serve it. According to a law of 1784, the winemakers may serve their own current wine, without a special license. These resaurants are licensed according to laws of the Bundesland. In Vienna these laws date from 1975. Very often,these establishments also serve cheese and sausages, other meat products, certain kinds of fish, mixed pickles, eggs, various spreads (to put on breads) etc. Usually they only serve cold dishes.
