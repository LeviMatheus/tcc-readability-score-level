Lynx is the name of four species of wild cats. Not all biologists agree about the taxonomy (scientific classification) of lynx in use today. "Kitten" is a baby cat or lynx.
Look.
Lynxes have short tails, and usually some hair on the ears. They have large paws (feet) padded for walking on snow, and long whiskers on the face. The color of the body is from light brown to grey and is sometimes marked with dark brown spots, especially on the legs. They weigh about 5 kg or about 11 pounds (approximately the size of a large Domestic Cat) and can weigh up to about 30 kg (66 pounds).
Habitat.
The lynx live in the high altitude forests with many shrubs, reeds and grass. It hunts only on the ground, but it can climb trees and swim.
It can be found in the some places in northern Scandinavia, in North America and also in the Himalayas. Since the 1990s people try to move part of the population of the Eurasian Lynx to Germany. It can also be found in Białowieża Forest (northeastern Poland), and southern Spain.
Since 1999, the Colorado Division of Wildlife try to move other wild lynx population from Canada back to the United States.
Life.
Usually, lynxes live alone, but a group can travel and hunt together. They sleep in crevices (openings in rocks) or under rocks. It gives birth to 2 to 4 kittens at a time. It eats birds and mammals, for example, rabbits, sheep and goats.
Taxonomy - Kinds of lynxes.
The Marbled Cat, "Pardofelis marmorata", is sometimes also called a kind of lynx.
The Caracal or Desert Lynx and the Jungle Cat are similar to the lynx, but they are not much relative.
Conservation.
The Iberian Lynx is the most endangered feline in the world. There are only two populations (togheter, 300 animals), in the southern Spain.
Hunting lynxes is illegal in many countries.
