Indus Valley toad ("Scientific name", "Bufo stomaticus") is a species of toad endemic to Pakistan, from the plains to about 1800m. It is particularly common in the Indus Valley, where it is the national amphibian of Pakistan.
This toad lacks cranial crests and the space between the eyes is broader than the upper upper eyelid. The tympanum of the ear is two-thirds the diameter of the eye. The first and second fingers are nearly equal and there is a single sub-articular tubercle. A spiny ridge is found on the tarsus. There is a tibial gland and the parotoid is longer than broad. Three dark bands run transversely on the forearm. The underside is whitish with dark mottling on the throat.
