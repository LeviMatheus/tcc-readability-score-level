The Carbon Footprint relates to the amount of carbon emissions human activity is leaving on the Earth.
Origin.
The use of carbon based resources is usually applied to the pollution caused by using fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuel (oil, gas, coal) to release energy produces carbon emissions. This also results in the greenhouse effect.
The Media.
It has become an expression often used by media to do with sustainability. Single people and businesses are often asked to consider the amount of carbon their particular use of resources is producing and how this affects the environmental concern and the likely link to global warming. This is often applied to travel and in particular oil use in air transport and automotive transport.
