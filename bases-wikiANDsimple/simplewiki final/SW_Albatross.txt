Albatrosses are a family ("Diomedeidae") of seabirds.
Albatrosses are hard working athletes. They have some amazing skills, for example they can fly a very long distance.
They are among the largest flying birds, weighing in at up to 10 kilograms (22 lbs). Some species have striking colors, and perform beautiful mating dances. Albatrosses live at sea and find their fish and squid food on the open ocean. They come to land on islands only because their young have to be on land until they can fly.
To handle this problem, albatrosses can cover thousands of kilometers on one trip to find food for their babies and themselves.
Scientists have found that there are 24 species of albatrosses. They all have a stocky body, webbed feet, very long wings, and hooked beak.
