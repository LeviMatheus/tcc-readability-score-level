"Theme Hospital" is a simulation computer game developed by Bullfrog and EA Games. It was published in 1997. The game is quite humourous.
The Game.
In the game, the player must build and operate a hospital. There are different rooms you can build. These are to diagnose the patient and to treat the illness.
Some illnesses are quite unusual. One is the bloaty head disease where the patient's head blows up. Another is the slack tongue disease, where the patient has an unusually long tongue.
