Team Milram is an Italian-registered UCI ProTeam established in 2006. The team is often called a German team because its main sponsor is Milram, part of the Nordmilch company from the "Land" Bremen.
Milram took over the ProTeam licence of Domina Vacanze. Erik Zabel and Alessandro Petacchi are the teamâ€™s top cyclists. There are 25 other riders, mainly from Germany and Italy. Milram is the third team in the UCI ProTour with a German main sponsor.
The team manager is led by Italian Gianluigi Stanga, who has been a team manager in professional cycling since 1983. The directeurs sportifs (Sports Directors) are the Italians Vittorio Algeri, Antonio Bevilacqua and Oscar Pellicioli. Gerry van Gerwen from the Netherlands is the commercial manager.
Milram only joined the UCI ProTour in 2006. Since then they have won 88 podium positions (that is, finished a race either first, second, or third) (24 first, 29 second, 35 third).
Team MILRAM reorganised itself for its second season. Five new riders joined and eight riders left the team. The most prominent new rider is Igor Astarloa, 2003 World Champion from Spain. Additionally, the team added Brett Lancaster, the up-and-coming riders Marcel Sieberg and Niki Terpstra, as well as neo pro Sebastian Schwager. After breaking his kneecap in 2006, Alessandro Petacchi regained his top form and won some races.
There is a MILRAM Continental Circuit Team, and those young riders and those from other U23 teams are helped so they can develop their skills
