"03 Bonnie & Clyde" is a single by rapper Jay-Z featuring R&B singer Beyoncé. It was taken from his ninth studio album ' and can also be found on the international editions of her solo debut album "Dangerously in Love". Released in 2002, the song reached number four on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyoncé's first top ten single as a solo artist; it also reached number two in the UK. The single is notable for causing drama between Jay-Z and Toni Braxton over what she claimed was a stolen sample. Jay-Z had to work with Suge Knight to secure the rights to cover this song from Tupac Shakur, who made the original version of the song called "Me and My Girlfriend" which appeared on his 1996 classic" " and which Jay-Z also referenced in his song "All I Need" from The Blueprint.
Music video.
The music video for the song, directed by Chris Robinson, was nominated for "Best Hip-Hop Video" at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, but it lost out to Missy Elliott's "Work It." The name of the song is a reference to Eminem's song "'97 Bonnie and Clyde", and by extension the original Tupac song, in which he refers to himself and his girlfriend as the "'96 Bonnie and Clyde".
There is an edited version of it, entitled "Bonnie & Clyde '03" which features many of Beyoncé's vocals rather than of Jay-Z. It is included in her "Dangerously In Love" CD.
