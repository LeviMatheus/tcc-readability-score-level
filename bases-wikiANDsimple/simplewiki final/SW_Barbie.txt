Origins.
When Barbara was a child, her parents saw she would rather play with paper dolls than baby dolls, her mother created the Barbie doll. But this information was later thought to be false as Barbara's mother had been contested by someone living near her, that she had created a much similar doll before she had. As their was no proof, Barbie remained.
Sexism.
Some people believe Barbie gives girls a wrong idea of what they will look like when they grow up. Barbie is a very big trend. She has had many sisters, boyfriends, and friends. She has dream houses and clothes. She has many jobs from teacher to doctor to astronaut. Barbie's current boyfriend is Ken, named after Barbara's brother. Barbie's current sister is Kelly. There have been many other dolls like Barbie since Barbie was first produced. Barbie also created MyScene dolls, a spoof of Bratz. Many people believe that the introduction of the Barbie doll was wrong due to the fact that it made young girls believe that they had to become skinny in order to be just like Barbie. Barbie is a teen doll, which gives little girls a peek at what might happen in their teen life. This is also thought to be bad, because Barbie has lots of boyfriends.
