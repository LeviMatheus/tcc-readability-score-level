The shiitake mushroom ("Lentinus edodes" or "Lentinula edodes"), also known as Chinese black mushroom or black forest mushroom, is an edible mushroom typically grown on the shii tree. Two Chinese variant names for high grades of shiitake are "dōnggū" ("winter mushroom") and "huāgū" ("flower mushroom," which has a flower-like cracking pattern on the mushroom's upper surface); both are produced at colder temperatures.
