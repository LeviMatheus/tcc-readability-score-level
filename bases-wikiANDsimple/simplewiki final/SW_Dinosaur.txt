Dinosaurs ("Dinosauria") were reptiles that lived a very long time ago. The word "dinosaur" comes from Greek, meaning "terrible lizard". Scientists think dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago. About 65 million years ago, dinosaurs became extinct. Birds are sometimes considered descendants of dinosaurs.
There were many kinds of dinosaurs. Today scientists know about hundreds of different kinds of dinosaurs. Some, called herbivores, ate plants and others, called carnivores, ate meat. The largest dinosaurs were plant-eaters, like "Apatosaurus" and "Brachiosaurus". They were the largest animals to ever walk on dry land.
Other plant-eaters had special weapons, to help them fight off the meat-eaters. For example, "Triceratops" had three horns on its face, "Ankylosaurus" was covered in boney plates, and "Stegosaurus" had spikes on its tail. Scientists have a good idea of what they looked like, because of the bones that have been found.
Most meat-eaters ran around on their back legs, like people do. Some were very large, like "Tyrannosaurus" and "Spinosaurus", but some were small, like "Compsognathus". It was the smaller sized meat-eaters that may have evolved into birds. One of the first birds was "Archaeopteryx", but it looked much like a dinosaur.
There were large flying reptiles that lived at the same time as dinosaurs called Pterosaurs, but they were not closely related to dinosaurs or even birds. There were also many kinds of large reptiles that could swim, like Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs, but they weren't closely related to dinosaurs either.
