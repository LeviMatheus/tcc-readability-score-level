11 Parthenope is a big, bright Main belt asteroid.
Parthenope was found by Annibale de Gasparis on May 11, 1850, the second of his nine asteroid discoveries. It was named after one of the Sirens in Greek mythology, said to have founded the city of Naples. De Gasparis "used his utmost endeavours to realise a 'Parthenope' in the heavens, such being the name suggested by Sir John Herschel on the occasion of the discovery of "Hygeia" in 1849".
There has been one seen occultation by Parthnope, on February 13, 1987.
