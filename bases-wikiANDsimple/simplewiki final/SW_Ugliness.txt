Ugliness is a property of physical things which are not nice to look at. Something or someone who has ugliness is called ugly. This word is commonly used in when talking about human appearance. The opposite of ugliness is beauty.
Ugliness can be a matter of opinion. Two people can look at the same object and one may think it is beautiful and the other may think it is ugly. This is shown in the popular phrase "Beauty is in the eye of the beholder". However, scientists have found that human ugliness is part of sexual selection (choosing a partner for sex) and shows poor genetic or physical health.
Although "ugly" usually means "a lack of physical beauty", the property of ugliness may also be used to describe other things such as music, literature, or human behavior.
