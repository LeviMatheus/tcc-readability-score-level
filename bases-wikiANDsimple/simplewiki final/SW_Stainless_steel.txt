In metallurgy, stainless steel means a ferrous alloy with a minimum of 10.5% chromium content. The name means that stainless steel does not stain, corrode or rust as easily as ordinary steel.
The term corrosion resistant steel is used when the alloy type has not exactly the 10.5% minimum of chromium, for example in the aviation industry. As such, there are now different and easily accessible grades and surface finishes of stainless steel, depending of the environment in which the material will used in its lifetime. Everyday use of stainless steel one finds in cutlery.
Stainless steels have a higher resistance to oxidation (rust) and corrosion in many natural and man-made environments; however, it is important to select the correct type and grade of stainless steel for the particular application.
