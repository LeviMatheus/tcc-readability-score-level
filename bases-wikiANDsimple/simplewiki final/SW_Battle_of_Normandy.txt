The Battle of Normandy was fought in 1944 between the German army and the Allied forces as part of World War II. Sixty years later, the Normandy invasion, codenamed Operation OVERLORD, is the largest invasion by sea in history, involving almost three million troops crossing the English Channel from England to Normandy in then German-occupied France.
The main Allied forces came from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, but a total of twelve nations contributed units, the rest being Australia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland.
