The head of government of a country is the person who runs it. This is not always the same person as the head of state.
For example in the United States the president is both the head of state and the head of government. In the Republic of Ireland the president is the head of state but the Taoiseach is the head of government. In most modern monarchies the king (or queen) is the head of state but not the head of government.
