The Sahara Desert in north Africa is the second largest desert in the world (after Antarctica). It is about 9,065,000 square kilometres in size. Some scientists think it is 2.5 million years old. It is the hottest place on the Earth, but not the driest. The driest is the Atacana desert in South America.
The name "Sahara" is from an Arabic word صحر that means "desert".
