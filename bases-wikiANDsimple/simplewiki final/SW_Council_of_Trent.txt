Council of Trent was the 19th Ecumenical council of the Roman Catholic Church. Considered one of the Church's most important councils, it was convened in Trento three times between December 13, 1545, and December 4, 1563, as a response to the Protestant Reformation. It clearly specified current Catholic doctrines on salvation, the sacraments, and the Biblical canon, it answered all Protestant disputes.
The council was first delayed and sometimes suspended because of resistance from the popes and revolt against the emperor. Emperor Charles V favored a council, and Pope Paul III finally summoned the council in 1537, but the plans fell through. In 1538, proposals for a council again failed. The pope convoked the council in 1542, but it didn't actually meet until 1545. The council was virtually suspended between 1547 and 1551. It again met from 1551 to 1552, when it was suspended due to a revolt against the emperor. Pope Paul IV (1555-1559) was so strongly anti-Protestant that the council could not reconvene until his succesor took office. The final period covered 1562 to 1563.
The Council of Trent was the most important event of the Counter-Reformation. It would be over 300 years until the next Ecumenical Council.
Pope Paul III (1534–49) – saw that the Protestant Reformation was no longer confined to a few preachers, but had won over various princes, particularly in Germany, to its ideas. Therefore he desired a council.
But the council was delayed until 1545, and convened right before Luther's death. It was transferred to Bologna in March, 1547 on the pretext of avoiding a plague; indefinitely prorogued, September 17th, 1549.
It was reopened at Trento, May 1, 1551, by Pope Julius III (1550–55); broken up 1552, recalled by Pope Pius IV (1559–65) for the last time, January 18, 1562, when it continued until December 4, 1563.
Objects and general results.
1. To condemn the principles and doctrines of Protestantism and to define the doctrines of the Catholic Church on all disputed points.
2. To effect a reformation in discipline or administration.
1. The church's interpretation of the Bible was final. Any Christian who substituted his or her own interpretation was a heretic. Also, the Bible and Church Tradition had the same authority.
2. The relationship of faith and works in salvation was defined, following controversy over Martin Luther's doctrine of "justification by faith alone".
3. Catholic practices such as Indulgences, pilgrimages, the veneration of saints and relics, and the veneration of the Virgin Mary were strongly reaffirmed.
The doctrinal decisions of the council are divided into decrees ("decreta"), which contain the positive statement of the conciliar dogmas, and into short canons ("canones"), which condemn the dissenting Protestant views with the concluding "anathema sit" ("let him be anathema").
