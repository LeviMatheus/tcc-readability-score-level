Casimir III the Great (Polish "Kazimierz III Wielki") (April 30, 1310 - November 5, 1370) was the King of Poland from 1333 until 1370. He was the son of Wladyslaw I.
During his rule, Poland grow up after fragmentation. He held peace with the Teutonic Order for as long a time as possible. He did this because he knew Poland was weak. Because of this, Casimir III changed direction of the Polish from north and west to east. In 1340, he conquered Red Ruthenia (and with it Lviv) from Hungary. Trade laws created by him made incomes from trade come into the city. This did much to make Cracow and Lviv more important and rich.
