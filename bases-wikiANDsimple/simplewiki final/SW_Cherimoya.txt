Cherimoya is a sweet fruit that comes mostly from Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia. The inside of a cherimoya is soft, and it is white in color. The skin of the cherimoya fruit is green when it is ripe, and brown if it becomes too ripe. The cherimoya has large, black seeds. They are poisonous, and should not be eaten, like the skin. The cherimoya is special because it can be grown in high places.
