American Airlines Flight 77 was an airplane that was hijacked by terrorists and was crashed into The Pentagon. The crash was a part of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States of America. 58 people (including 5 hijackers) and 6 crew members died in the crash. The plane was a Boeing 757, and the time of the crash was 9:37 am Eastern Daylight Time.
Theories.
Some think that a Boeing 757 did not crash into The Pentagon, because the hole in the building from the crash was only 75 feet wide, while the wingspan of a Boeing 757 (the length from the end of one wing to the other) is 124 feet.
