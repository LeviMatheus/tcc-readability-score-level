Fairtrade certification (often just Fairtrade or Fair Trade Certifiedâ„¢ in the United States) is a system which gives a certificate to some products. These products must follow rules about fairness to workers and the environment.
The FLO International system gives certificates to many different products, including bananas, honey, oranges, cocoa, cotton, dried and fresh fruits and vegetables, juices, nuts and oil seeds, quinoa, rice, spices, sugar, tea and wine.
