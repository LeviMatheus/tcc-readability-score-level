The United States Congress is the legislative, or law making branch of the United States government.
It has two houses (parts): The United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate. This two house system is known as a "bicameral" ("bi" is an old word for "two", and "camera" is an old word for "chamber" or "room") legislature.
The primary duty of Congress is to write, debate, and pass bills (laws they want), which are then sent to the president. If the President agrees the bill should be a law he or she signs the bill. If the bill is not signed, it does not become a law, and people say the President did a "veto" of the bill.
Most U.S. states make laws the same way, except the State House and Senate together are called a "legislature" instead of a congress, and the bills are sent to the state "governor", since states do not have presidents.
