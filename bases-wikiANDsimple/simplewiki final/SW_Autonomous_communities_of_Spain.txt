Spain is divided in 17 parts called autonomous communities. "Autonomous" means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the United States of America, for example.
Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In 1978 these parts came together, making the autonomous communities.
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called "historic communities": Galicia, País Vasco and Cataluña. These communities have 2 official languages: Spanish and their own language (gallego or eusquera or catalán).
Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: Ceuta and Melilla. They are called "autonomous cities".
