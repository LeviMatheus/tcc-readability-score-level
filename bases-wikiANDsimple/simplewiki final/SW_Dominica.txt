The Commonwealth of Dominica is an island nation that is located in the Caribbean Sea, between the French-speaking territories of Guadeloupe and Martinique. The island measures 751 km² (290 mi²) in area. Roseau is its capital; Portsmouth is another main town. Close to seventy thousand people live on the island.
The currency of the island is the East Caribbean Dollar.
The island's name comes from the Latin for Sunday, "Dies Dominica". It is not to be confused with the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles.
Because of the lush beauty and untouched splendour it boasts (also seen in its rainforests), it is nicknamed the "Nature Island of the Caribbean".
The President of Dominica is Nicholas Liverpool; its prime minister is Roosevelt Skerrit.
Dominica was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493. In 1763, it became a territory of the United Kingdom from which its independence was received on November 3rd, 1978.
In August 1979, Hurricane David, the most powerful storm to hit the island, wiped out its entire infrastructure.
In 1980, Dame Eugenia Charles became its prime minister, and the first one of her kind in the West Indies.
On November 21, 2004, the island was hit by its most destructive earthquake in history; Portsmouth and the northern area were deeply affected.
Dominica is most famously depicted in Jean Rhys' classic prequel to "Jane Eyre", "Wide Sargasso Sea".
