Peoples Temple was an organization founded in 1955 by Jim Jones that, by the mid-1970s, possessed over a dozen locations in California including its headquarters in San Francisco. It is best known for the death of over 900 of its members on November 18, 1978 in Guyana, at the Peoples Temple Agricultural Project (informally called "Jonestown"), a nearby airstrip at Port Kaituma, and Georgetown.
