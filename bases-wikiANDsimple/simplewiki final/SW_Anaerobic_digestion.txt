Anaerobic digestion (AD) is the process of decomposition of material in an environment without oxygen. This process does happen naturally as well, but it is called anaerobic digestion only if it is supported and contained. An anaerobic digester is an industrial system that supports these natural process to treat waste, produce biogas that can be used to power electricity generators, provide heat and produce soil improving material.
