Cetology is a type of science. It is the study of the cetaceans, which are whales, dolphins, and porpoises.
Cetology is the branch of marine mammal science that studies the approximately eighty species of whales, dolphins, and porpoise in the scientific order Cetacea. The term was coined in the mid-19th century from the Greek cetus ("whale") and -ology ("study").
Cetologists, or those who practice cetology, seek to understand and explain cetacean evolution, distribution, morphology, behavior, community dynamics, and other topics.
