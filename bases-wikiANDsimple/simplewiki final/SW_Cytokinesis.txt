"Cytokinesis" is the division of cells after either Mitosis or Meiosis I and II.
During Cytokinesis, the "cytoplasm" (the liquid center of the cell that holds the "organelles" into place.) splits into two equal halves, a cleavage point appears and the cell becomes two daughter cells. This occurs right after the beginning of anaphase (in mitosis and in meiosis I and II) and continues during telophase (in mitosis and in meiosis I and II) until the cell has completely divided and interphase (in mitosis and meiosis II only) has re-started.
Cytokinesis in plants.
In plants cytokinesis is slightly different. As plant cells cannot move apart because of their rigid cell wall, a cell plate begins to form during late anaphase and throughout telophase. When the cytoplasm and organelles are divide evenly between the two new cells, the plate then becomes less flimsy and soon becomes another rigid cell wall separating the daughter cells.
