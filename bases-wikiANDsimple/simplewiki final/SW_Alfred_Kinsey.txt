Alfred Charles Kinsey (June 23, 1894 - August 25,1956) was an American biologist. He was interested in entomology and zoology. He is best known for the research he did on human sexuality. His research had a great influence on social and cultural values in many parts of the world. It also had a determining influence on the sexual revolution that happened in the 1960s.
He wrote some papers which became known as the Kinsey Reports. In them, he asked himself how widespread or differentiated human sexual practices were. He wondered, how much difference there was in the way different people had sex with each other. He developed the Kinsey Scale to measure sexual orientation. On one end of the scale, at the value 0, the individual is entirely heterosexual. On the other end, at value 6, he or she has a purely homosexual orientation.
Many people see him as the father of sexology.
