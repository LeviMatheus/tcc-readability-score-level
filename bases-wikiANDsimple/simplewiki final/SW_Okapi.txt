The Okapi ("Okapia johnstoni") is an even-toed ungulate mammal from central Africa. With the Giraffe they form the family "Giraffidae".
Appearance.
The Okapi has velvety brown fur, and the upper part of the legs and the backside have white stripes. They have long black tongues, which are long enough to wash their eyes and ears. Male Okapis have small horn-like stumps on their head which are covered with skin. Females do not have these horns.
Life.
Okapis live in the rainforests of central Africa, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
They are mostly active during the day. Okapis eat mostly leaves and buds from trees, but also grass, ferns, fruit, and fungi.
Okapis usually live alone. After 420 to 450 days of pregnancy the mother gives birth to one baby, which drinks milk for up to 6 months. Okapis become mature when they are 4-5 years old. In captivity Okapis can become 30 or more years old.
Other information.
The Okapi was unknown and a mystery to western researchers for a long time. In the past, scientists thought that the Okapi was a mix between the giraffe and the zebra.
The "International Society for Cryptozoology" uses the Okapi as its symbol, because the Okapi was unknown for a long time.
