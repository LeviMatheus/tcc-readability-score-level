Proceratosaurus was a dinosaur from the Middle Jurassic era around 180 million years ago. It was found in London, England, the capital of the United Kingdom in Europe. It was first believed to be an early ancestor of Ceratosaurus; though later scientists discovered that it was actually an ancestor of the coelurosaurs. It was probaly an early relative of Compsognathus and the later tyrannosaurids like Tyrannosaurus. The Proceratosaurus usually grew up to 7 feet tall and 17 feet long.
