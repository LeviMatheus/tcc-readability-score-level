The Cantonese Wikipedia () is the Cantonese edition of Wikipedia, run by the Wikimedia Foundation. It started on 25 March 2006.
As a small community, from early on, Cantonese wikipedians have decided to follow by the policies and rules of the English Wikipedia, wherever they are applicable. This idea has provided sucsus and allows wikipedians to concentrate on the content. As of August 1, 2008, the Cantonese Wikipedia has more than 190000 edits, 8500 articles, and more than 6100 registered users, 11 of whom are administrators.
Cantonese is one of the five regional Chinese languages to have its own Wikipedia. The other four are: Minnan Wikipedia (Main Page), Mindong Wikipedia (Main Page), Wu Wikipedia (Main Page), and Hakka Wikipedia (Main Page). It is also the second largest Wikipedia edition of Chinese languages (including Classical Chinese Wikipedia).
