The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is the first video game console made by Nintendo. It came out in 1985 in the United States and was very popular.
The controller for the NES was different from the joysticks that older consoles had. It had a D-pad button, that could go up, down, left, or right. It also had A, B, Select, and Start buttons. The NES could use use up to two controllers for multiplayer games. There were also other types of controllers that could be used with the NES.
Some games for the NES are Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Mega Man, Castlevania, Donkey Kong, and Final Fantasy. There have been many sequels made to these games, and they are still enjoyed today.
