Choreography (or "dance-writing") is the art of making dances. It tells dancers how they should dance and move.
A person who does choreography is called choreographer. A choreographer makes a dance based on music or a synopsis (a writing of what occurs in the dance).
Origin.
The word choreography was first seen in the American English dictionary in the 1950s.
Before this, people said "Dances Staged By,"
or "Dance Director" to talk about choreographers.
