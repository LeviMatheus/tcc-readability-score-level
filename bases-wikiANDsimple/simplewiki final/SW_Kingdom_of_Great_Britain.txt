The Kingdom of Great Britain, also known as the United Kingdom of Great Britain, was a state in Western Europe, in existence from 1707 to 1800. It was created by the merger of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, under the Acts of Union 1707, to create a single kingdom that included the whole of the island of Great Britain. A new single parliament and government, based in Westminster in London, controlled the new kingdom. The two separate kingdoms of Scotland and England had shared the same monarch since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I.
The Kingdom of Great Britain was followed by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 when the Kingdom of Ireland became part of the United Kingdom by the Act of Union 1800 after the suppression of the Irish Rebellion of 1798.
