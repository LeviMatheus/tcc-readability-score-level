Newton metre is the unit of moment in the SI system. It is abbreviated N m or N·m, and sometimes written with hyphen "newton-metre". It is a compound unit of torque corresponding to the torque from a force of one newton applied over a distance arm of one metre.
A newton metre is dimensionally equivalent to a joule.
