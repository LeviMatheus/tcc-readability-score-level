A cell wall is the wall of a plant cell. Animals' cells do not have cell walls. It is there mainly to protect the cell from damage. It is also there to make the cell strong, to keep its shape, and to control the growing of the cell and plant.
In a plant cell, the cell wall is made of long molecules called cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose. The cell wall lets some proteins in and keeps others out. Water and small molecules can go through to help the cell.
