is a meal common in Japanese cuisine, made to take away from home to be eaten somewhere else. A traditional bento consists of rice, fish or meat, and one or more pickled or cooked vegetables as a side dish. Containers for bento may be very different, from disposable mass produced to hand crafted lacquerware. While bento are can be bought at many stores and in all of Japan, it is still considered a very important skill of a Japanese housewife to be able to prepare a good boxed lunch.
Bento can be very elaborate, aesthetically pleasing cuisine arrangements. Often the food is arranged in such a way as to resemble other objects: dolls, flowers, leaves, and so forth. For some special occasions like hanami, more elaborate and bigger bentos are prepared.
