Godzilla is a giant dinosaur-like fictional monster who first appeared in movies from Japan, starting in 1954.
During his movie career, this large reptile fought against several other mythical monsters, including the giant moth-like Mothra, the three-headed King Ghidorah, his own robotic mirror image Mechagodzilla, and many more.
The Japanese name, "Gojira", is a combination of the words "gorilla" and "kujira" (means "whale").
