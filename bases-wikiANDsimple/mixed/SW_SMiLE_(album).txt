"SMiLE" was a Beach Boys album. Their bass player Brian Wilson wanted the album to be the follow-up to the album "Pet Sounds". For some reasons, it was not released for over 30 years.
1960s.
After seeing the success that "Pet Sounds" had been, Wilson wanted to make an album that was even better. In late 1966, he started work on what he said would be "the greatest rock album ever made." He asked poet Van Dyke Parks to write words for new songa.
Not released.
When the time came to release the album, Brian said that the album was not finished and would be delayed for an unknown length of time. People still hoped that he would finish it, but in 1968, the album was cancelled. Wilson had stopped working on it and it would never be finished.
"Smiley Smile".
Later in 1968, The Beach Boys released another album called "Smiley Smile". The album had new songs that used many unused instrumental parts written and recorded for "SMiLE". "Smiley Smile" was not the great success that Wilson thought "SMiLE" would have been. The Beach Boys lost many fans because of the album's failure. The failure also cost Capitol Records much money because not enough people bought the album. Many years later, Brian Wilson's brother Carl, who played lead guitar for the band, took over Brian's place songwriter and producer for The Beach Boys.
2004.
In 2004, 3 years after Brian left The Beach Boys, he finished "SMiLE" to celebrate his completion of rehab (a program to get people to stop using drugs). The album was a huge success. People were happy that "SMiLE" could finally be heard as it was meant to be heard.
