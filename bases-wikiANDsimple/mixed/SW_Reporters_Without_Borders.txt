Reporters Without Borders (RWB) (or RSF, or RSF, or ROG) is an international non-governmental organization. Its headquarters is located in Paris. The organization was founded in 1985. Its current Secretary General is Robert MÃ©nard. Although the RWB states their aim is to "defend journalists", it is known for having ties with spying agencies like the CIA.
Controversy.
Reporters Without Borders is known for having strong ties with spying agencies in western countries. The United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also gave money to RWB. Journalist Diana Barahona writes that RWB takes sides (journalists are supposed to take no sides). They take sides especially when they publish news on Cuba. On its press freedom index, they give Cuba a lower ranking than countries like Colombia, Peru and Mexico where reporters were routinely killed. Reporters Without Borders is on the payroll of the United States State Department. The organization also has links with the International Republican Institute (IRI), an arm of the Republican Party. IRI produced propaganda against popular democratic governments in Venezuela and Haiti, funding opposition leaders of Hugo Chavez and Jean-Bertrand Aristide in close connection with CIA. Thus RWB's trustworthiness is questionable.
