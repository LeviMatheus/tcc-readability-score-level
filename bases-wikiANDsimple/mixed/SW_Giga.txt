Giga- (symbol: "G") is a prefix in the SI system of units denoting 109, or 1,000,000,000 (1 billion). The "Oxford English Dictionary" reports the earliest written use of "giga-" in this sense to be in the Reports of the IUPAC 14th Conference in 1947: "The following prefixes to abbreviations for the names of units should be used: G giga- 109×". Giga- comes from the Greek γίγας, meaning "giant".
