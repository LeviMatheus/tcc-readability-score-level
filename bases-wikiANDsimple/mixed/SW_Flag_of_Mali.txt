The flag of Mali has three equal vertical stripes. Starting from the flagpole, the colours are green, gold, and red, which are the pan-African colours.
The flag became official on March 1, 1961. The original flag became official on April 4, 1959, when Mali joined the Mali Federation. This flag was the same, but the golden stripe had a human "stick figure", called a "kanaga", in black, with its arms pointing to the sky. The figure was removed because of an Islamic belief against making pictures of humans. (Mali is about 90% Muslim.)
