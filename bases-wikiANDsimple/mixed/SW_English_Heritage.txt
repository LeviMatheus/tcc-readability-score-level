English Heritage is an organization of the United Kingdom government (Department for Culture, Media and Sport). It manages many monuments of the historic environment of England. It was set up under the terms of the National Heritage Act 1983. Before the Department of the Environment had had these functions.
British Heritage takes care of many important historical and archaeological sites, from Stonehenge to the world's earliest iron bridge. But it has responsibilities in conservation, giving advice, registering and protecting the historic environment as well. It also maintains a public archive, the National Monuments Record (NMR).
