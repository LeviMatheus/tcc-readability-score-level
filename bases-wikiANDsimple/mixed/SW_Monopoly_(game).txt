Monopoly is a board game played by two to eight players. It is played on a board with spaces named after streets. These streets are actual streets in Atlantic City in New Jersey in the United States. In the British version, they are named after streets in London. Like many board games, each person has his own game token that he moves on the board. If he/she passes the go space, he/she collects $200. There is also a pair of dice, and play money. A person wins by having the most money at the end of the game. There are many versions of Monopoly such as Star Wars Monopoly and Create-your-own-opoly (where you name the streets yourself).
On the Monopoly board are 40 spaces. In the four corners of the board are the space where each player begins, called "GO"; "Free Parking", "JAIL", and "Go to Jail". Along the sides of the board are properties and businesses for sale. There are 22 "properties", 4 "railroads", the "Electric Company" and the "Water Works". There are also "Income Tax" and "Luxury Tax", and "Community Chests" and "Chances".
