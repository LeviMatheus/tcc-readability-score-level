Baguettes are long thin loaves of bread popular in France, and other French-speaking countries.
Baguettes are common in Europe. Usually, they are made of white bread. They need to be eaten rapidly, because the white bread goes bad very fast. Baguettes usually have a hard crust on the outside but soft white bread on the inside.
French laws say that bread may only contain the following four things: flour, water, yeast and salt. Anything containing more than those things must not be called bread.
A baguette is about 5-6 cm wide, 3 to 4 cm high, and about 65 cm long. Such a baguette usually weighs about 250 grammes. Breads which are thinner (and lighter) are called ficelle (thread). It is common to dip the bread into olive oil when it is eaten.
