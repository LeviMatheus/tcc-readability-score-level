Cabo Enga√±o is a cape near Punta de Agua, the easternmost point of the island of Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic. The region around the cape is very dry where cacti grow.
Christopher Columbus saw the cape for the first time on 16 January 1493 and named it as Cape Sant Theramo (or Cape San Telmo).
Punta Cana International Airport, one of the busiest airport of the country, is to the south of the cape.
