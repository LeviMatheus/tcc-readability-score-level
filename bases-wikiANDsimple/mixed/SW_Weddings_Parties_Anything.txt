Weddings Parties Anything (sometimes called WPA and Weddoes) were an Australian folk rock band. They started in 1984 in Melbourne, Victoria. The band stopped playing together in 1998. They took their name from The Clash song "Revolution Rock". Music expert Billy Pinnell said their first album "Scorn of the Women" was the best first Australian rock album since Skyhooks' album "Living in the '70s".
