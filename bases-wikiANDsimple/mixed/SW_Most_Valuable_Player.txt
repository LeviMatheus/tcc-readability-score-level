In sports, a Most Valuable Player award is an honour given to the player or players of a team that performed better than the other players throughout a league or contest. It was first used in professional sports, but is now used a lot in amateur sports and other things unrelated to sports, such as business and music awards. A similar award used in sports, often in soccer, is man of the match.
