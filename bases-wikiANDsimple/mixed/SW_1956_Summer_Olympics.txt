The 1956 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVI Olympiad, were held in 1956 in Melbourne, Australia. However, the equestrian events were not held in Australia because of quarantine regulations. These events were held five months earlier in Stockholm, Sweden, making it the second time that events of the same Olympics were held in different countries. (In the Antwerp, Belgium Olympics of 1920 one sailing event had been held in Dutch waters). Melbourne was chosen as the host city over instead of Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Montreal and six American cities on April 28, 1949 at the 43rd IOC session.
