A longbow is a type of bow. It is much longer than most other bows and is much more powerful.
The longbow was mainly used in the Middle Ages up until Henry VIII's reign. The longbow was mainly an English weapon, with the best users of it being English or Welsh.
It was made from hard wearing, flexible wood, and could fire great distances. The people who fired longbows made their enemies very frightened. The French often cut off the forefinger and middle fingers of those that they caught. This led to the archers trying to make the French angry by waggling the fingers in a "Two-Fingered Salute", which is today considered rude.
