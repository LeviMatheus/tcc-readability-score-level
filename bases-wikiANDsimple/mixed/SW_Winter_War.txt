The Winter War (November 30, 1939 - March 13, 1940) was a conflict fought between the Soviet Union and Finland. It began when the Soviet Union tried to invade Finland soon after the Invasion of Poland. The Soviet military forces expected a victory over Finland in a few weeks, but the Finnish forces resisted both better and longer than expected.
