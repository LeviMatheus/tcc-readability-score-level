The Asian Black Bear ("Ursus thibetanus" or "Selenarctos thibetanus"), also known as the Asiatic Black Bear, Tibetan Black Bear, the Himalayan Black Bear, or the Moon Bear, is a medium sized, sharp-clawed, black-colored bear with a distinctive white or cream "V" marking on its chest. It is a close relative of the American Black Bear with which it is thought to share a European common ancestor.
