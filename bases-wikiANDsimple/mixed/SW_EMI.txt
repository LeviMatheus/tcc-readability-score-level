EMI is a music company based in London and New York. It is in charge of a record label, EMI Music. EMI is one of the "big four" record labels; labels not part of the "big four" are called. It started in 1931, when it was called "Electric and Music Industries". In 1957, it took over Capitol Records.

It almost bought Universal Records in 1998, too. In 2007, it was taken over by a group called Terra Firma, after it said no to a bid from Warner.
