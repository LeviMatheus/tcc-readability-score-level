The aurochs or urus ("Bos primigenius") was a very large type of cattle, that was once very common in Europe but is extinct now.
The word "aurochs" (or) comes to English from German. The use in English of the plural form "aurochsen" is directly parallel to the German plural and analogous to English "ox" (sg), "oxen" (pl).
The word "urus" () comes to English from Latin, but came to Latin from Germanic origins. The words "aurochs", "urus", and "wisent"Â  have all been used synonymously in English., But the extinct aurochs/urus is a completely separate species from the wisent (the European bison).
According to the Paleontologisk Museum, University of Oslo, aurochs developed in India some two million years ago, came into the Middle East and further into Asia, and reached Europe about 250,000 years ago. They were once considered a distinct species from modern European cattle ("Bos taurus"), but today not any more. Modern cattle have become much smaller than their wild forebears: the height of a large domesticated cow is about 1.5 meters (5 feet, 15 hands), whereas aurochs were about 1.75 meters (5.75 feet, 17 hands). Aurochs also had several features rarely seen in modern cattle, such as lyre-shaped horns set at a forward angle, a pale stripe down the spine, and different color according to the sex. Males were black with a pale stripe down the spine, while females and calves were reddish (these colours are still found in a few domesticated cattle breeds, such as Jersey cattle). Aurochs were also known to have very aggressive temperaments and killing one was seen as a great act of courage in ancient cultures.
Subspecies.
At one time there existed three aurochs subspecies, namely "Bos primigenius namadicus" (Falconer, 1859) that occurred in India, the "Bos primigenius mauretanicus" (Thomas, 1881) from North Africa and naturally the "Bos primigenius primigenius" (Bojanus, 1827) from Europe and the Middle East. Only the European subspecies has survived until recent times.
