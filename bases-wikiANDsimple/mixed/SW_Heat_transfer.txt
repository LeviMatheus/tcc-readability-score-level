In thermal physics, heat transfer is the passage of thermal energy from a hot to a cold body. When a physical body, e.g. an object or fluid, is at a different temperature than its surroundings or another body, "transfer of thermal energy", also known as heat transfer, happens in such a way that the body and the surroundings reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Heat transfer always occurs from a hot body to a cold one, a result of the second law of thermodynamics. Heat transfer can never be stopped; it can only be slowed down.
