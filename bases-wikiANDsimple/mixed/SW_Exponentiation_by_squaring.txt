Exponentiating by squaring is an algorithm. It is used for the fast computation of large integer powers of a number. It is also known as the square-and-multiply algorithm or binary exponentiation. It implicitly uses the binary expansion of the exponent. It is of quite general use, for example in modular arithmetic.
Squaring algorithm.
This algorithm is much faster than the ordinary method to compute such a value. Multipliying x by itself, n operation's are needed to calculate "x n". With the method shown above, only log2(n) operations are needed.
