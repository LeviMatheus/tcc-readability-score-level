Hull, Florida is found in Southwest DeSoto County, Florida in the US. It is 861 miles from the US capital Washington, DC. The population is only around 150 people.
Hull was the site of a creosote tie treating plant for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad, which was acquired by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad during the 1920s. The Seaboard Railroad continued the creosote plant operation through the 1950s. In the late 1920s, Hull became the junction of a new branchline of the SAL to Fort Myers and Naples. For a period of time, name train passenger service was operated on the branch. This line was abandoned in 1953.
