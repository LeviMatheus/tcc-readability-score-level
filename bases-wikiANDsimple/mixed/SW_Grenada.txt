Grenada is an island nation in the Caribbean Sea that received its independence from the United Kingdom in 1974. Its capital is St. George's.
The island was invaded by the American military in 1983 because of Cuba's presence there. In 2004, a hurricane named Ivan destroyed most of the island's resources.
Grenada is called the Spice Island on account of its most famous export, the nutmeg.
