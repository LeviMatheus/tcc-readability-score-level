St. Paul's Cathedral is a cathedral in Central London, England. It was built in 604. The man who built it was called Mellitas Bishop of the East Saxons. In 962 and 1087 the cathedral burnt down and was built up again. Before today's version of the cathedral there were four others but they also burnt down because they were built with wood. Today's cathedral is made of stone and it was built in 1666, after the Great Fire Of London. St Paul's is a popular tourist attraction and is still used as a church today.
