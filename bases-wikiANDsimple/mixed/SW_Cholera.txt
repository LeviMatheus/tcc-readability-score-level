Cholera is an infectious disease. It is caused by a bacteria "Vibrio cholerae". This bacteria usually lives in water. "Vibrio cholera" is more common where fresh water mixes with salt water, like where rivers enter the ocean. It is more common in water with lots of algae.
Symptoms.
Cholera is an acute intestinal illness, causing abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea, and vomiting.
The diarrhoea and vomiting, in turn, can cause very bad dehydration of the body, leading to death
if untreated. Dehydration is losing too much water and salts.
How people get cholera.
Cholera is contracted by eating foods and/or drinking water contaminated with the bacterium "Vibrio Cholerae".
Often, people get cholera from eating fish that is not cooked enough. They can also get it if they eat food or drink that was polluted with the diarrhoea from people who have cholera.
How to treat cholera.
People with cholera need medical treatment. Most of the treatment for cholera is giving people fluids (water) and electrolytes (salts). For most people with cholera, fluids and electrolytes are given by mouth. This can be done with 80-90% of people. The best way to give this by mouth is WHO-ORS: World Health Organization Oral Rehydration Solution. (Oral means by mouth. Rehydration means to give back fluids and electrolytes to someone who is dehydrated. Solution is a mixture of salts and water.)
Some people cannot take enough fluids and electrolytes by mouth. Usually this is because vomiting is so bad. These people must be given treatment intravenously. (Intravenous means into a vein. Intravenous fluids and electrolytes are given through a needle into a person's vein.) This is necessary because if people cannot drink enough fluids and electrolytes, they can die quickly.
