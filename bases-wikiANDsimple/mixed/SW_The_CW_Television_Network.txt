The CW Television Network, is a television network that created when two of the United States six major television networks (The WB and UPN) merged in 2006, making only five major broadcast networks now, in the US, the other four are CBS, NBC, ABC, and FOX. Veronica Mars was cancelled after its third season on the CW, despite mass protest from loyal viewers. The viewers sent in Mars Bars candybars in protest to keep VM on the air. In fact, there are now NO Mars candybars left in the United States, due to this protest. Storylines were left incomplete, and some viewers have become less supportive of the network since Veronica Mars was so unjustly ripped off the network.
