Between the years AD 1900 and 2099, September 11 of the Gregorian calendar is the leap day of the Coptic and Ethiopian calendars. These leap days occur in the years immediately before leap years in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. In all common years of the Coptic and Ethiopian calendars, September 11 is New Year's Day.
Since 2001, the date has been widely known for the terrorist attacks that occurred in the United States that year. The date is also lesser known for the date of a 1973 Chilean coup d'Ã©tat, that overthrew the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende and would lock Chile in a 17-year dictatorship, which left around 3,000 people dead or missing.
