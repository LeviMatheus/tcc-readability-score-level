The Holguín province was established in 1978, when it was split from the "Oriente" region.

At Moa, there is a huge cobalt processing plant with shipping facilities, that was constructed with the help of foreign aid, much of it from Canada. There are chrome, nickel, iron and steel plants dotted throughout the province as well.
