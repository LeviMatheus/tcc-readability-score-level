Marcus Antonius (Latin: M·ANTONIVS·M·F·M·N¹) (ca. 82 BC – August 1, 30 BC), known in English as Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general. He was an important supporter of Julius Caesar as a military commander and administrator. After Caesar's assassination, Antony allied with Octavian and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus to form the second triumvirate. The triumvirate broke up in 33 BC and the disagreement turned to civil war in 31 BC, in which Antony was defeated by Octavian at the Battle of Actium and then at Alexandria. Antony committed suicide along with his wife, Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt, in 30 BC.
