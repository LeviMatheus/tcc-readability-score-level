The Class 180 "Adelante" is a type of British diesel multiple unit built by Alstom between 2000 and 2001 at Washwood Heath in Birmingham. The units are express trains originally built for First North Western but then the contract was passed over to First Great Western (FGW) to supplement their High Speed Train fleet. However, due to reliability and operating problems the decision was made to withdraw most of the fleet from service. The majority of the units have already been returned to the Leasing Company with the remainder of the fleet to follow in due course. Four operators are currently looking for Class 180 units, which are unwanted by First Great Western, indicating the desperate shortage of high-speed InterCity rolling stock on Britain's railways.
