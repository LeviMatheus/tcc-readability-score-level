Go Fish is a game with playing cards. 2-10 people can play.
Every player gets five cards. The rest of the cards (the deck) are put face down where all the players can get them. Cards that are the same color and the same number are called pairs. If a player has a pair, they put it face up in front of them so everybody can see it. The player to the left of the player who gave everybody their cards goes first. When it is a player's turn, they ask another player for a card that is the same color and number as one they already have. They can ask any player. If the other player has the card, they give it to the one that asked, and the one that asked puts the pair in front of them and gets to go again. If the other player does not have the card, then they say, "Go Fish," and the player that asked takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If a player has no cards when it is time for him to go, then he just takes a card from the deck and the next player goes. If there are no cards in the deck and the player has no cards, then that player doesn't get to go. The game ends when all the cards are face up in pairs. The winner is the player with the most pairs.
