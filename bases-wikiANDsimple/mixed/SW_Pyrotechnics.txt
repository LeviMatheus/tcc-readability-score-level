Pyrotechnics is often thought to be synonymous with the manufacture of fireworks, but it includes also items for military and industrial uses.
Items such as safety matches, oxygen candles, explosive bolts and fasteners and the automobile safety airbag all fall under pyrotechnics. Without pyrotechnics, modern aviation and spaceflight would be impracticable.
This is because pyrotechnic devices combine high reliabilty with very compact and efficient energy storage.
