The Labrador Retriever (or Lab and Labrador for short) is a breed of dog.
Labrador Retrievers are very gentle dogs with family-friendly personalities. They enjoy attention and exercise with their owner. This dog is great with children. They love to run around in big, open spaces, have a natural love of bringing things back, and learn to retrieve easily. They like the water no matter what temperature outside as their coat protects them. They are strong swimmers as they have webbing between the toes on their paws. They come in three colors: black, yellow, and chocolate or brown. There are many different shades of "yellow" Labrador, including a type that looks bronze or dark orange.
This tough, hardy breed of retriever is a great choice as a family pet. They are playful, easy to train, and naturally obedient. Labrador Retrievers do require regular amounts of daily exercise and are prone to obesity. As a pet, they can be demanding of attention and are best suited in a home where they can have a daily workout. They like water and have a unique otter-like tail, which they use like a rudder when they swim.
The origin of the Labrador Retriever is unsure due to the many different theories to how the Labrador, as we know it, came to exist. A popular theory is that the Labrador's ancestors were brought to Newfoundland by English fisherman. These dogs were descendants of Newfoundland dogs brought to Europe and bred with Portuguese Water Dogs and other sports dogs.
Although there is only one type of Labrador Retriever recognized by the CKC (Canadian Kennel Club), many Labrador enthusiasts will argue that there are actually two types of Labradors. These can be broken down into the categories of English (Show) Dogs and American (Field) Dogs.Labs are fairly easy to train(with gentleness and patience), and make great family pets,but need to be acquainted with kids at an early age.They are very energetic dogs.
