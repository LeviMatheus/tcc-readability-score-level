The Computer Contradictionary is a non-fiction book by Stan Kelly-Bootle that compiles a satirical list of definitions of computer industry terms. It is an example of "cynical lexicography" in the tradition of Ambrose Bierce's "The Devil's Dictionary". Rather than offering a factual account of usage, its definitions are largely made up by the author.
The book was published in May 1995 by MIT Press and is an update of Kelly-Bootle's "The Devil's DP Dictionary" which appeared in 1981.
Reception.
The "Los Angeles Times" panned the book, wrote that it was "smartly-titled" but was an "awfully stupid book". "ACM Computing Reviews" recommended dipping into it because "a dictionary is a difficult read".
