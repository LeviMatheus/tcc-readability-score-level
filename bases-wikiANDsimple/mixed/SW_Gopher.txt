Gophers are small, burrowing rodents. There are over 100 kinds of gophers in America. Gophers have long front teeth, tiny features, and short tails. They live in very complex tunnels underground. They live by themselves and feed on roots and shrubs. They are known to be pests and ruin people's lawns and gardens.
More notable are the Pocket gopher (which is a true gopher). Some gophers are really ground squirrels or marmots.
