In British English, a supporter is a person who likes and supports a sportsperson or a team. Many teams of some sports have thousands of supporters, for example, the football team Real Madrid.
In American English, "supporter" is more often used in other subjects, for example, in politics. In sports, the word "fan" (from "fanatic") is more often used.
