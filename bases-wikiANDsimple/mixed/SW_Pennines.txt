The Pennines are a mountain range in England. Often said to be the "backbone of England", they form an unbroken range stretching from the Peak District in the Midlands, through the Yorkshire Dales, parts of Greater Manchester, the West Pennine Moors of Lancashire and Cumbrian Fells to the Cheviot Hills on the Scottish border. Their total length is about 250 miles (400 km).
Etymology.
The name Pennines is believed to come from the Celtic "pennioroches", meaning "hill", although the earliest written reference to the name dates only from the 18th century.
Altitude and size.
The mountains are not very tall and are often called hills. The highest is Cross Fell in eastern Cumbria, at 893 metres (2930 feet). Other principal peaks include Mickle Fell (788 m/2,585 ft) Whernside (736 m/2,415 ft), Ingleborough (723 m/2,372 ft), Pen-y-ghent (693 m/2,274 ft), and Kinder Scout (636 m/2,087 ft).
The landscape of the Pennines are mostly upland areas of high moorland.
The Pennines constitute the main watershed in northern England, dividing the eastern and western parts of the country. The rivers Eden, Ribble, and Mersey flow westwards towards the Irish Sea. On the other side of the watershed, the rivers Tyne, Tees, Swale, Calder, Aire, Don, and Trent flow eastwards to the North Sea.
