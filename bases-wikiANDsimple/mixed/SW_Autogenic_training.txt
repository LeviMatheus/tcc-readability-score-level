Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the German psychiatrist Johannes Schultz and first published in 1932.
The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures ("e.g." lying down, sitting meditation, sitting like a rag doll, "etc.").
Schultz emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. However, unlike some forms of yoga and meditation, autogenic training is devoid of any mysticism. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system.
