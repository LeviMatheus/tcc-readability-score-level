A smile is a facial expression a person normally makes when they are happy. People smile for many reasons e.g. told a funny joke or smiling for a picture to be taken. However, sometimes people smile to cover up an embarrassing feeling. A smile can often be used as a sign of confidence or agreement or as a sign of happiness. Animals sometimes show their teeth -known as a snarl- to show fear or power.
Internet.
On the Internet, smiles can normally be typed up. This is normally called a smiley, smiley face, or happy face. Smileys show emotion when people are not able to see it in real life. Smileys typed on the computer are called emoticons. Smileys can change depending on where the person typing the smiley is.
