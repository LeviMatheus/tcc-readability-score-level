The California Gold Rush was when a lot of people went to the mountains of California to find gold. It started when James W. Marshall found pieces of gold while building a sawmill for John Sutter in 1848. Hundreds of thousands of people went to California. However, some people stayed home and opened supply shops supplying travelers with mining tools.
Many people became rich, but most did not. Besides trying to find gold, some people started selling things. Sometimes a woman could earn more than her mining husband. Men like Levi Strauss also sold things. He invented and sold jeans made from denim. We can say that the California Gold Rush ended in 1855.at that time, gold miners went back home because gold was harder to find.
