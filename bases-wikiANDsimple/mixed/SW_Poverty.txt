Poverty is not having enough money to have basic needs like food, water, shelter, or toilets. Many people in different countries live in poverty, especially in developing areas of Africa, Latin America and some parts Asia.
There are different ways to measure poverty. The World Bank says that "extreme poverty" is when someone needs to live on less than US$ 1 a day (that dollar is an ideal one. It has been adjusted to rule out certain effects of inflation, meaning that prices of things increase higher than what a person is paid, and other price level differences). "Moderate poverty" is when people need to live on less than 2 such dollars a day. In the year 2001, 1,100,000,000 people were seen as "extremely poor", and 2,700,000,000 were seen as "moderately poor".
In the developed world this does not apply. There, many people are seen as the "working poor". They have a job, but do not earn enough money. They need to spend a lot of that money for living expenditures, so that at the end of the day, little of it is left.
There are different ways to tell if a country is rich or pooor. The Gross Domestic Product, or GDP and HDI are two of those measures. Gross Domestic Product which is the money made from trade from inside the country. the product made from another country and sold within the country does not count even if a product is made.
HDI, meaning the Human Development Index is a different matter. It is determined by life expectancy and adult literacy rates. Places in Africa like Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone are the poorest, with Sierra Leone having the lowest HDI ranking in the world.
