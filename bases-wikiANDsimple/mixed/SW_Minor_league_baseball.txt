Minor league baseball is a level of professional baseball in North America. It is made up a many different teams which play in many leagues and levels of ability. Minor league teams are used by Major League teams to have a place to put their players who they do not feel are good enough to play in the Major League yet.
Once a player has shown he is good enough to play in one level of the minor leagues, he is usually moved up to a higher, more difficult level, until he is finally able to play in the Major Leagues. This way players are able to get better at baseball before having to play against tougher opponents. Almost all players in the Major Leagues had to play in the minor leagues first in order to become good enough to play in the Major Leagues.
Sometimes, Major League players who are have been hurt will play a few games in the minor leagues before playing in the Major Leagues again, in order to see if they feel good enough to start playing again.
There are also other professional baseball leagues that Major League teams do not use to as a place put their players. These are known as "Independent Leagues". In these leagues players do not go to higher or lower levels of ability.
