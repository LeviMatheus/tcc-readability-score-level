Edward III (13 November 1312 – 21 June 1377) was one of the most successful English monarchs of the Middle Ages. He ruled for 50 years.
He made England the strongest military power in Europe.
Edward was crowned when he was fourteen years old, after his father was forced to resign. After his victory against the Scots, he declared himself heir to the French throne in 1337 and so started the Hundred Years' War. The war went very well for England; the victories of Crécy and Poitiers led up to the Treaty of Brétigny by which he gained a lot of territory. When he became older, he was much less active mostly a result of his bad health.
Edward also established the Order of the Garter, and developed of legislature and government. But during his reign there was the Black Death.
In his own time and for centuries after Edward III was praised a lot. But by Whig historians he was seen as an irresponsible adventurer. This view has turned, and modern historians see what a good king he was.
