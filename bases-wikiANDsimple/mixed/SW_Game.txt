Games are played for fun and enjoyment. One person can play a game, or many people can play a game.
A game usually has rules telling players what to do and what not to do. Players follow these rules in a game. Some games have many rules and are more complicated some games have few rules and are very simple. In a game, one person can win and another can lose. Or they both can win, or they both can lose. Where there is no winner and no loser, it is often called a drawn game or a tied game. Games can be played on a computer, or they can be played with a ball or board. Some games, like "Eye Spy" can be played only by looking at things.
