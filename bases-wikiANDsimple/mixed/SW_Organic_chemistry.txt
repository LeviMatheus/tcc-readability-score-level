Organic chemistry is a type of chemistry that deals mostly with carbon-based molecules. It gets its name from an old belief that these molecules could only be made from organic matter (animals, plants, soil, etc.). Scientists now know that this belief is untrue. The old belief was disproven when Friedrich Wohler made urea in a laboratory without any organic matter. Most chemical compounds with carbon are considered organic, but there are some compounds that are called "inorganic". Carbon monoxide (CO) is an example of an inorganic compound. Another example of inorganic is polythene.
