Croydon is a place in south London, England and is part of the London Borough of Croydon. It is the 20th best shopping area in the UK, and currently has two shopping centres called Centrale and the Whitgift Centre, with a third one called Park Place planned. There is a large bus station on the edge of Croydon, called West Croydon, and two train stations.
The town is well known for holding a lot of offices for companies to let. The council wants to keep Croydon a big town by building more offices and entertainment facilites so a new re-generation plan called the Croydon Gateway is planned. Purley Way, just south of Croydon, is a large retail park area which has many shops like Comet, Sainsbury's, McDonald's, IKEA, Argos, M&S, Boots along with a cinema and bowling alley.
Tramlink, a tram system, is mainly centred in Croydon. It is the only tram system in the whole of London at the moment. There are three routes that operate on the system, Route 1, Route 2 and Route 3 or Yellow, Red and Green. The tram goes to places like Elmers End and Beckenham in Bromley, Wimbledon and Mitcham in Merton and Addington and Addiscombe in Croydon.
