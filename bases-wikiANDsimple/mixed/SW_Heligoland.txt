Heligoland is a small German group of islands in the North Sea.
It was formerly Danish and then British. The islands in the southeastern corner of the North Sea have a population of 1,650. They are the only German islands not nearby to the mainland and are about two hours' sailing time from Cuxhaven at the mouth of the River Elbe.
Geography.
Heligoland is located 70 km (44 miles) from the German coast line and actually consists of two islands: the populated triangular-shaped 1 km² (0.4 sq mi) main island ("Hauptinsel") to the west and the "Düne" ("dune," Heligolandic: "de Halem") to the east. While the former is what the place name "Heligoland" normally is used to refer to, the latter is somewhat smaller (0.7 km²), lower, surrounded by sand beaches and not permanently inhabited.
