A medium is the way or means information is sent or received. Paper is a common "medium", used every day by millions of people. Television is another very common medium; it is said that there is not a community on Earth where at least one family does not own a television. The plural form of "medium" is "media", so radio and television are both types of broadcast media, but paint, charcoal, ink, and clay are types of artistic media. When people buy or sell things, the "medium" is often coins or paper money, but it may also be shells, gems, livestock, or even an agreement to perform a service in the future.
A medium is also a person who it is said can pass messages between the living and the dead. This type of medium was quite popular in the West in the 19th century, but most were found to be dishonest and few remain today. In Taoism, mediums still work. However, the power of mediums is mostly believed by the superstitious.
Medium is also a size, coming between small and large. Other words used in this way include "intermediate", "average", and "middle".
