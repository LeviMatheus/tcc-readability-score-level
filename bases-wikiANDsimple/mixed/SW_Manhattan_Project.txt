The Manhattan Project was the program in which the United States tried to make the first nuclear weapons. The project went on during World War II, and was run by the U.S. Army. The head of the project was General Leslie R. Groves, who built the Pentagon, while the top scientist on the project was Robert Oppenheimer, a famous physicist. The project cost $2 billion, and created many secret cities and bomb-making factories, such as a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a nuclear reactor in Hanford, Washington, and a uranium processing plant in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The project was a success, and the United States created two nuclear bombs which they used against Japan in 1945.
After the war, the laboratory is since abandoned. Today, it is an empty ghost town on the deserts of New Mexico.
