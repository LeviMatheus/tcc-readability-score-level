The Second International (1889-1916) was an organization created in 1889 by socialist and labour parties who wanted to work together for international socialism. It continued the work of the dissolved First International, though taking out the still-powerful anarcho-syndicalist movement and unions, and was still there in 1916.
Among the Second International's most famous actions were its (1889) declaration of May 1 as International Labour Day and its (1910) declaration of March 8 as International Women's Day.
The International's permanent executive and information body was the International Socialist Bureau (I.S.B.), in Brussels and formed after the International's Paris Congress of 1900. Emile Vandervelde and Camille Huysmans of the Belgian Labour Party were its chair and secretary. Lenin was a member from 1905.
