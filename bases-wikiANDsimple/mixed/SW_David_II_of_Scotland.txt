David II (March 5, 1324 â€“ February 22, 1371) King of Scots, son of King Robert the Bruce by his second wife, Elizabeth de Burgh (d. 1327), was born at Dunfermline Palace, Fife.
He was married on July 17 1328 to Joan of the Tower (d. 1362), daughter of Edward II of England and Isabella of France.
David became king of Scotland after the death of his father on June 7, 1329. He was crowned at Scone in November 1331.
After the victory of Edward III of England in July 1333, David and his queen went to France. In June 1341 he came back and began to rule. In 1346 he invaded England, but was defeated and taken prisoner at the Battle of Neville's Cross on October 17, 1346, and remained in England for eleven years, living principally in London and at Odiham in Hampshire. In October 1357 he was allowed to go back to Scotland for a payment of 100,000 marks. The money was never paid completely.
In 1371 David died in Edinburgh Castle.
