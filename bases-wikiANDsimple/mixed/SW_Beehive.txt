A beehive is an enclosed structure in which some species of honey bees (genus "Apis") live and raise their young. Natural beehives (or "nests") are naturally-occurring structures occupied by honey bee colonies, while domesticated honey bees are kept in man-made beehives in a location known as an apiary; it is these man-made structures that are most typically referred to as "beehives".
