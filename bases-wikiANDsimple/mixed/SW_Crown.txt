A crown is a type of headdress worn by a monarch. They are usually worn when they are crowned or at important occasions. Also, crowns are now used as a symbol of the monarchy.
Some children, mainly girls, connect flowers in a chain and wear them on their heads as if they were crowns. These are called "daisy chains" and have nothing at all to do with crowns. A crown can also be a part of the head.
