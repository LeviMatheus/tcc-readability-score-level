Weight is a property of matter on the earth. The earth pulls matter to it. This pull is called weight.
The matter pulls the earth too. Things weigh different when they are at sea level and on top of a mountain.
Measuring Weight.
The weight of a thing can be measured with a scale. The weight is a number showing how much the earth pulls the matter. The number needs a unit of measurement to be useful. The unit of weight used in science and engineering is the Newton, which is actually a unit of force. This is because weight is nothing more than a force.
