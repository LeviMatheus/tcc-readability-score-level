Embalming is the act of preserving a dead body, so it will not decompose. Most bodies are embalmed, if they have to be on display or lie in state for a funeral. Embalming is similar to mummification, which is what ancient people in Peru and Egypt did to their dead. Embalming is different from taxidermy, where you only preserve the skin.
