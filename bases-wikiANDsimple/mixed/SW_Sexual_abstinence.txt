Sexual abstinence is the practice of voluntarily refraining from some or all aspects of sexual activity. Common reasons to deliberately abstain from the physical expression of sexual desire include religious or philosophical reasons (e.g. chastity), material reasons (to prevent conception (undesired pregnancy) or Sexually Transmitted Disease transmission), or to conform to legal regulations.
Sexual abstinence has been debated since ancient history, both in terms of same-sex and opposite-sex relationships.
Premarital chastity.
Many religious and ethical systems proscribe sexual activities between a person and anyone other than a spouse of that person, including most denominational variations of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, as have, historically, many legal systems and societal norms.
