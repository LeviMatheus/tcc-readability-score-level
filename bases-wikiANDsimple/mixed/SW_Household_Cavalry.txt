The British Household Cavalry, is a army corps (pronounced "core") of two regiments of soldiers. Cavalry regiments, until the end of World War I, were always "mounted" on horses. Nowadays "cavalry regiments" are mounted on tanks. The British Household Cavalry is unusual because they are also still mounted on horses. The reason for this is that they are part of the "Household Division". In Britain the "Household Division" has the special duty of guarding the monarch and the royal household. The term "Household Division" is used in all Commonwealth countries.
In many other countries there are similar highly-trained army corps which guard the head of state and have ceremonial duties as well as regular military service. Regiments of this sort can be found in Australia, Brunei, Belgium, Canada, Denmark and many other countries. But when speaking in English of the "Household Cavalry", the term generally refers to the "British Household Cavalry".
