Doppler effect is a change in frequency and wavelength of a wave. It is caused by the change in distance between the thing creating the wave (causer) and whatever is measuring (watcher), seeing or hearing the wave.
Another word for "causer" is "sender". Another word for "change in distance" is "speed".
For waves read all the waves that can send out or reflected by a object. And for reflection read change of direction of a wave.
Effects of changes in distance.
If watcher and causer get closer, the wavelength is shorter and the frequency is higher.
If the distance between watcher and causer gets longer, the frequency is lower and the wavelength is longer.
For lightwaves can also be read
An extreme example of the doppler effect is an airplane flying at a faster speed than the speed of sound and how the wall of sound is heard on the ground.
