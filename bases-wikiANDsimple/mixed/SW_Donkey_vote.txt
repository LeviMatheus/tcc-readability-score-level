A Donkey vote is where someone numbers an election ballot paper in the order of the candidates being listed. For example, if J. Smith, M. Doe and N. Citizen were on a ballot paper, and the voter put a 1 beside J. Smith, a 2 beside M. Doe and a 3 beside N. Citizen, that would be classed a donkey vote.
