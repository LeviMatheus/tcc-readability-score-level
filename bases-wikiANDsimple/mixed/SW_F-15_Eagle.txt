The F-15 Eagle is a fighter jet that originally made by McDonnell-Douglas (later Boeing). It is known around the world for its toughness and "undefeated" record, meaning that it has never been shot down by an enemy plane. It is used primarily by the United States Air Force, but it is also used in Israel, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. It carries missiles to shoot down, or kill enemy fighter jet planes.
Redesign.
In 1981, the F-15 was redesigned to include the ability to carry bombs, allowing the F-15 to assume a ground-attack role, as well. This means that in addition to shooting down other planes, it can kill buildings on the ground. This new variant (design) of the aircraft was called the " F-15E Strike Eagle".
