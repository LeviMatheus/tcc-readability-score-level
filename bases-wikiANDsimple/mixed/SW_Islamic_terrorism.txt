Islamic terrorism is a kind of terrorism. The terrorists claim their religion, Islam, or how they interpret it is their motivation.
Many islamic scholars and theolgians say that it is wrong to kill innocent people. Suicide is something the Koran sees as wrong. The people doing terroist attacks, and saying their religion made them do it usually follow a very minority interpretation of Islam.
