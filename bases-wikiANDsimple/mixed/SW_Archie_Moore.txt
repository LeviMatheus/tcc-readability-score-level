Archie Moore (December 13, 1913 or 1916 â€“ December 9, 1998) was an American boxer. He held the light heavyweight championship between 1952 and 1961. Moore won the title from Joey Maxim by unanimous decision in 1952. He later lost the belt because he did not defend the title enough. Moore also fought for the heavyweight championship twice. He lost to Rocky Marciano on September 22, 1955, and to Floyd Patterson on November 30, 1956, in both of those attempts. One of his last fights was to Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali. Afterwards, Moore was Ali's trainer for a short time.
