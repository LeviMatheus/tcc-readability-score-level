Fertility is the natural capability to give life. In humans and animals, fertility means that the parent can produce babies.
In agriculture fertility means that a soil can support the growth of plants because it contains the right minerals and nutrients.
Fertility can also mean that something is very active: having a "fertile imagination" means being able to think of many new and interesting things.
As a measure, "Fertility Rate" is the number of children born per couple, person or population. This is different to fecundity. This is defined the "potential" for reproduction (influenced by gamete production, fertilisation and carrying a pregnancy to term). In the English language, the term was originally applied only to females, but increasingly is applied to males as well, as common understanding of reproductive mechanisms increases and the importance of the male role is better known. Infertility is a deficient fertility.
Human fertility depends on factors of nutrition, sexual behavior, culture, instinct, endocrinology, timing, economics, way of life, and emotions. Animal fertility is no less complex, and may display astounding mechanisms.
Female fertility after 30.
The use of fertility drugs and/or in vitro fertilization can increase the chances of becoming pregnant at a later age.
Doctors recommend that women over 30 who have been unsuccessful in trying to conceive for more than 6 months undergo some kind of fertility testing.
