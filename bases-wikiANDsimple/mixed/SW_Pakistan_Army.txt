The Pakistan Army (Urdu: پاک فوج) is the largest branch of the Pakistan military, and is mainly responsible for protection of the state borders, the security of administered territories and defending the national interests of Pakistan within the framework of its international obligations. Every year the 6th of September, as day after the annual celebration of the Pakistan Defense Day, the day is celebrated as the Army day in Pakistan. That day ground shows and other programs mark the PNA's role in defending the nation.
The Pakistan Army, combined with the Navy and Air Force, makes Pakistan's armed forces the seventh largest military in the world.
