"Dianthus" is a genus of about 300 species of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae, found mainly in Europe and Asia, with a few species found south to north Africa, and one species ("D. repens") in Arctic North America. Common names include carnation ("D. caryophyllus"), pink ("D. plumarius" and related species) and sweet william ("D. barbatus"). The name "Dianthus" is from the Greek words "dios" ("god") and "anthos" ("flower"), and was mentioned by the Greek botanist Theophrastus.
