Big Brother UK 2008 is the 9th series of Big Brother UK. New rules have been put in place since the last series and this one has been branded "Zero Tolerance" (meaning that no bad behaviour will be accepted). So far, there have been 20 housemates. Four of them have been evicted and two have been removed from the house for rule-breaking.
