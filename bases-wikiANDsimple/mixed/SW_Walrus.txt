A walrus is a marine mammal, the only species of the family Odobenidae, which is one of the three pinniped families. They live in the cold northern seas around North America and Europe.
Prominent distinguishing features of the walrus include a large bristly mustache used to feel the sea bottom for the small animals they eat, and a pair of tusks (really large upper teeth) used to dig up clams.
