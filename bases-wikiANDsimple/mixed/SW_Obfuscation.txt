Obfuscation means to make something harder to understand. Weasel words are a form of obfuscation. Obfuscation is usually used when people either do not know what they are talking about or wish to hide their meaning.
Some people say that when doctors use difficult medical words to hide unpleasant things from patients, they are using obfuscation.
