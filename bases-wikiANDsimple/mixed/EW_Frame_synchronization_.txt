In telecommunication, frame synchronization or framing is the process by which, while receiving a stream of framed data, incoming frame alignment signals (i.e., a distinctive bit sequences or syncwords) are identified (that is, distinguished from data bits), permitting the data bits within the frame to be extracted for decoding or retransmission.
Framing.
If the transmission is temporarily interrupted, or a bit slip event occurs, the receiver must re-synchronize.
The transmitter and the receiver must agree ahead of time on which frame synchronization scheme they will use.
Common frame synchronization schemes are:
Frame synchronizer.
In telemetry applications, a "frame synchronizer" is used to frame-align a serial pulse code-modulated (PCM) binary stream.
The frame synchronizer immediately follows the bit synchronizer in most telemetry applications. Without frame synchronization, decommutation is impossible.
The frame synchronization pattern is a known binary pattern which repeats at a regular interval within the PCM stream. The frame synchronizer recognizes this pattern and aligns the data into minor frames or sub-frames. Typically the frame sync pattern is followed by a counter (sub-frame ID) which dictates which minor or sub-frame in the series is being transmitted. This becomes increasingly important in the decommutation stage where all data is deciphered as to what attribute was sampled. Different commutations require a constant awareness of which section of the major frame is being decoded.
