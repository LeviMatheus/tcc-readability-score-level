A pocket is a bag which is part of an item of clothing, reached through an opening in the clothing. The fabric of the clothing is shaped to make these little pouches or purses which are very handy for keeping small amounts of money and other small objects for daily use.
Pockets can be on pants, shirts, skirts, or dresses. Pockets come in very different styles, shapes, closed or unclosed with zippers or buttons. Some styles of clothing though, do not have pockets.
