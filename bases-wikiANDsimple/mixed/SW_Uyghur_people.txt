The Uyghur (also spelled Uygur, Uighur, Uigur; Uyghur: ئۇيغۇر;) are a Turkic people of Central Asia. Today Uyghurs live primarily in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (also known by its controversial name East Turkistan or Uyghurstan).
There are Uyghur diasporic communities in Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, Germany, United Kingdom and Turkey and a smaller one in Taoyuan County of Hunan province in south-central China. Uyghur neighborhoods can be found in major Chinese cities like Beijing and Shanghai. There are small but very active Uyghur communities in the United States, mainly in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, DC, as well as Toronto and Vancouver in Canada.
