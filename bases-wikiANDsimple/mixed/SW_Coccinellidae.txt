What lady beetles look like.
Most people know lady beetles as small, round, red beetles with black spots on their backs. Not all lady beetles are red, and not all red lady beetles have spots. Some lady beetles are very little and are black and hairy. Other lady beetles are red or yellow but have black stripes. Some red lady beetles have no spots or stripes at all!
Brittney roxOne of the most common lady beetles in much of North America is the seven-spotted lady beetle. Scientists call it "Coccinella septempunctata". The name means ("sept") "seven" ("punctata") "holes", because it looks like the beetle has seven black holes in its back.
Each ladybird is different and many have individual charming characteristics.
What lady beetles eat.
Almost all lady beetles are carnivores, which means they eat other animals. The animals lady beetles eat are other insects. Many of these insects have soft bodies, such as aphids. Even baby lady beetles eat other insects.
