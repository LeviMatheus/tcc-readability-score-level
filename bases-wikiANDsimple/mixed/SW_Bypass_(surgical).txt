In medicine, a bypass usually means making another route for the blood to flow. Sometimes an artery, the channel through which the blood flows, becomes blocked up. The patient has a bypass operation. Very often the surgeon will take part of a vein from the patient's leg and move it to the place with the blockage so that the blood can flow round the blocked part.
