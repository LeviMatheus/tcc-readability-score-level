Charles Haddon (C.H.) Spurgeon (June 19, 1834 â€“ January 31, 1892) was a British Baptist preacher. People still know him as the "Prince of Preachers". In his lifetime, Spurgeon preached to around 10,000,000 people. Spurgeon would often preach 10 times a week at different places. His sermons have been translated into many languages. Today, there are more writings and books by Spurgeon than by any other Christian writer.
Spurgeon was the pastor of the New Park Street Chapel in London for 38 years. He was part of several controversies with the Baptist Union of Great Britain, and later had to leave that denomination. Throughout his life, Spurgeon suffered from depression and other mental illnesses. In 1857, he started a charity organisation called Spurgeon's which works all over the world.
