The Golden Raspberry Awards or Razzies, first awarded in 1981, were created by John Wilson in 1980, with the intention to be the opposite to the Academy Awards by dishonoring the worst that the film industry had to offer. It usually takes the form of a raspberry spray-painted gold and mounted on a plastic base.
Today, awards are voted by the membership of the "Golden Raspberry Award Foundation" (GRAF), and anyone can become a member of the foundation, something that doesn't happen with the Academy Awards. Traditionally, nominations are made public one day before the Motion Picture Academy announces its Oscar nominations, and the awards are presented one day before the Oscar ceremony.
The term "raspberry" is used as a joke, as in "blowing a raspberry."
