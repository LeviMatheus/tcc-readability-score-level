Naming.
In Russian-speaking countries, people are supposed to name their children after their father. One of the most famous Russian names is Anastasia. Girls' middle names are their fathers name plus a feminine ending of either "evna" or "ovna." Boys have their father's name as well, with a masculine ending added of either "evich" or "ovich." Girls' have their father's last name, and most of the time to make it feminine they add an "a" to their father's last name. Boys also carry their fathers name, no ending is added.
