Fame came to him from designing the Alaska flag. Benny was the winner of the contest conducted for Alaska students in grades seven through twelve in 1926. The Alaska Legislature adopted the design as the official flag for the Territory of Alaska on May 2, 1927. Later, the drafters of the Alaska constitution stipulated that the territorial flag would become the official flag of the State of Alaska.
