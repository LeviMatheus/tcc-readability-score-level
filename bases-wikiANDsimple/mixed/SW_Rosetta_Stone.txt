The Rosetta Stone is a stone that was discovered in Egypt in 1799. It had three pieces of writing on it that all said the same thing, but in three different languages. One was in an Ancient Egyptian writing called "Demotic", one was in another Ancient Egyptian writing called "Hieroglyphics", and one was written in Ancient Greek. This stone greatly helped historians who were trying to find out more about Ancient Egypt - its discovery led to the translation of Ancient Egyptian writing.
The historians could read the Greek and Demotic, and so they could then translate the words into Hieroglyhpics, and they then knew how to read the ancient words that people could not read for so many years. Demotic was the local language of the people in Egypt at that time.
The stone is named after the city where it was found, Rosetta. Today, that city is called "Rashid". The stone is now in the British Museum in London.
Part of the text.
The complete Greek text, in English, is about 1600â€“1700 words in length, and is about 20 paragraphs long (average 80 words/paragraph). In essence, the Rosetta Stone is a tax amnesty given to the temple priests of the day, restoring the tax privileges they had traditionally enjoyed from more ancient times. Some scholars speculate that several copies of the Rosetta Stone must exist, as yet undiscovered, since this proclamation must have been made at many temples.
