A link is a part of a chain. A chain is made of many pieces of metal; each piece is a link.
But today people also use the word link in a new way. The World Wide Web on the Internet is made of many different Web pages. The computer software that people use to make these pages (HTML) lets us go to other pages in a very fast and easy way.
The person who makes the Web page can tell the computer to show a word or a picture on the Web page as a link. This means that when we click on the link with our computer mouse, the computer will show us the new page we want to see. A lot of links are blue, and look like this, but a link can be any color.
Another word for this kind of link is hyperlink.
