A cluster is anything that is more than one item put together. For example a bunch of bananas is a cluster of bananas, or a classroom of kids is a cluster of kids. We say that bees get into a cluster when they swarm.
In music a cluster is a large group of notes on the piano usually played with the arm. Composers like John Cage used clusters.
