The Sugar Glider ("Petaurus breviceps") is a small marsupial originally native to eastern and northern mainland Australia, New Guinea, and the Bismarck Archipelago, and introduced to Tasmania.
Introduced into the United States approximately 15 years ago as domesticated housepets, Sugar Gliders are an extremely popular companion pet.
According to a recent 2007 study conducted by the American Veterinary Medicine Association (AVMA), it is estimated that American families have 1.1 million domestic Sugar Gliders in their homes; placing them between hamsters (1.2 million) and Guinea Pigs (1 million) in commonality as a household pet.
