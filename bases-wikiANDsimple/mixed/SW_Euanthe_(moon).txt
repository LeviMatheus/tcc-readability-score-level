Euanthe or is a non-spherical moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.
Euanthe is about 3 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,465,000 km in 598.093 days, at an inclination of 143° to the ecliptic (142° to Jupiter's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2001.
It was named in August 2003 after Euanthe, who was the mother of the Graces, according to some Greek writers.
Euanthe belongs to the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000 km, at inclinations of about 150°.
