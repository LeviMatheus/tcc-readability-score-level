Snakes are reptiles. They do not have legs. Snakes are known to eat small animals, for example mice and birds. Some snakes are venomous - their bite can be toxic (the toxin goes through their teeth), or they can spit venom. Some snakes like the Rubber boa or the Sand boa are small but some types like the Green Anaconda or Reticulated Python can be very large. Some snakes, like the King Cobra, are venomous, but some are not. They move by pushing and pulling themselves with the muscles on the bottom of their bodies. They swallow their food whole, sometimes by dislocating their jaws. Once the snake's prey is in its body, its internal muscles crush it so the animal can be digested. They are cold-blooded carnivores and some eat large prey. They feed on rodents and mice. They capture prey in many ways. Some snakes are big enough to kill a full grown person, but this is rare.
