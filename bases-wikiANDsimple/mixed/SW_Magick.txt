Magick is an old way to spell the word "magic". This spelling was used by Aleister Crowley for occult magic. He wanted to make it clear that he did not mean stage magic.
Crowley defined magick as "the science and art of causing change to occur in conformity with the will." By this, he included ordinary acts of will as well as acts of ritual magic.
