The Free City of Danzig (German: "Freie Stadt Danzig"; Polish: "Wolne Miasto Gda≈Ñsk") existed between 1920 and 1939.
The City had its own post office, currency and citizenship, but it was not independent: it was administered directly by the League of Nations, represented by a High Commissioner. The city was governed by the Senate. The head of state was the President of the Senate. The Free City was represented abroad by Poland's ambassadors.
