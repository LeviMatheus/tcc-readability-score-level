What is called the Gaza Strip is a stretch of land along the Mediterranean. The main city in the Gaza Strip is called Gaza. At the beginning of 2006, the strip is not part of any recognised country. Currently it is the Palestinian Authority that manages the territory.
It is amongst the most densely populated areas on Earth. About 1.5 million people live on a surface of roughly 493 kmÂ².
The Palestinian Authority says that this is an occupied territory. They say, Israel is the occupation force, and it should withdraw, and give the territory back to the Palestinians.
Israel does not see things this way: They gave over the territory to Palestinian administration in 2005, and have pulled back their troops.
Most inhabitants are related to the people expelled from Israel after the war of 1949/50. They live in refugee camps. The main problems facing the area are unemployment, poverty, and crime.
