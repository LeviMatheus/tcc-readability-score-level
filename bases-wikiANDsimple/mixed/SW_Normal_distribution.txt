The normal distribution is a probability distribution. It is also called Gaussian distribution, because it was discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. The normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution. It is very important in many fields of science. Normal distributions are a family of distributions of the same general form. These distributions differ in their "location" and "scale" parameters: the mean ("average") of the distribution defines its location, and the standard deviation ("variability") defines the scale.
The standard normal distribution (also known as the Z distribution) is the normal distribution with a mean of zero and a variance of one (the green curves in the plots to the right). It is often called the bell curve because the graph of its probability density looks like a bell.
