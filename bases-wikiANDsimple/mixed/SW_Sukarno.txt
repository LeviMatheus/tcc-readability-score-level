Sukarno (June 6, 1901 â€“ June 21, 1970) was the first President of Indonesia. He helped the country win its independence from the Netherlands. He was President from 1945 to 1967, presiding with mixed success over the country's turbulent transition to independence. Sukarno was forced to resign by one of his generals, Suharto. Suharto formally became President in March 1967.
The spelling "Sukarno" has been official in Indonesia since 1947. The older spelling Soekarno is still frequently used, mainly because he signed his signature in the old spelling. Official Indonesian presidential decrees from the period 1947-1968, however, printed his name using the 1947 spelling.
Indonesians also remember him as "Bung" Karno or "Pak" Karno. Like many Javanese people, he had one name; in religious contexts, he was occasionally referred to as 'Achmad Sukarno'.
