Quality is how good something is. If the quality of something is high then that means that the product is very good, and if the quality of a item is low that means that the product is not really good. When people say something is a quality product that means that the product is high quality. Usually high quality thing cost a lot of money an low quality things do not really cost much money. In other words things that are low quality are cheap.
