The word force means "to make someone or something do something".
For example, "Soldiers came to the town and forced all the people there to leave."
Scientists also use the word "force". In the science of physics, a force causes objects to accelerate (change the way they are moving). When equal forces act in opposite directions, they cancel each other out.
Gravity is a force. It makes things move toward each other. On the Earth, we see that it makes things fall toward the ground.
