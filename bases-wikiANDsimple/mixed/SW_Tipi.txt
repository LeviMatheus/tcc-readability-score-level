A tipi (also called tepee or teepee) is a kind of tent. It is cone-shaped. They were made by Native Americans of the Great Plains who frequently moved from place to place.
Tepees are made from long poles, and are covered with material. Long ago the material was animal skin or tree bark. Today, they are made from cloth.
Tepees were put up in as a circle, which symbolized the life.
Tepees are no longer usually used for a full-time home, but they are still used for special occasions, such as pow-wows.
Tepees were used by the Lakota
