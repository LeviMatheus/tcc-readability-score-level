Penicillin is a common antibiotic, used to treat bacterial infections. Penicillin was discovered by Scottish scientist Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928. It was not mass-produced until the 1940s, however. Penicillin is sometimes used to treat syphilis, tonsilitis, meningitis, and pneumonia as well as other diseases. It was commonly used during World War 2. Penicillin was discovered when Fleming went to the sink and found a mold stopping bacterial fungus growing on the plates. Australian scientist Howard Walter Florey made the penicillin mold into a medicine. Together with another scientist Ernest Boris Chain, Fleming and Florey were given the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1945.
