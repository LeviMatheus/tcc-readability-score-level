The Hanging Gardens of Babylon (also called the Hanging Gardens of Semiramis) and the walls of Babylon (near present-day Al Hillah in Iraq) are one of the Seven Wonders of the World. They were built by Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 BC. He is told to have built the gardens to please his wife, Amytis of Media. She wanted to see the trees and plants of her homeland. The hanging gardens were destroyed in an earthquake after the 1st century BC.

Some people do not believe the Hanging Gardens were real. In ancient writings the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were first described by Berossus, a Chaldean priest. He lived in the late 4th century B.C. Greek historians later wrote more about them.

However, recently there have been digs on the banks of the Euphrates River of some large 25 meter-thick walls.
