A fixed-wing aircraft or aeroplane or airplane is a kind of aircraft, something that can fly, but is heavier than air. Airplanes are sometimes called just 'planes. All airplanes have wings. Gliders are airplanes that do not have engines.
History.
A steam-powered unmanned fixed-wing aircraft, that weighed 9 lbs., was built by John Stringfellow in 1848. It could fly by itself without needing to be dropped from high up. There were gliders before this, but they had to fly by being pushed off a building or hill.
The first time a man flew (that is: took off, steered an aircraft and landed it) a motor-powered fixed wing aircraft was by Orville Wright in 1903 in Kitty Hawk, USA. However, the airplane called "Flyer 1" was not fully controllable. The first powered, controlled, sustained fixed-wing aircraft flight was made by a Brazilian called Alberto Santos Dumont in 1906, in Paris.
Modern day.
Today, fixed-wing aircraft fly between many cities and bring many people and cargo. Big cities usually have an airport - the place where fixed-wing aircraft can land and take off safely. Some large cities like New York City have more than one airport. Two major makers of airplanes are Airbus and Boeing.
Defensive uses.
The first aircraft for war bombing was used in Lybia in 1911 by Italy against the Ottoman Empire. Some fixed-wing aircraft are used by air forces to defend countries. These fixed-wing aircraft may use guns or missiles for combat with other aircraft, or they may drop bombs on ground targets.
Fixed-wing aircraft let people travel longer distances faster than ships or trains. Aircraft can fly from New York to London in about 7 hours. It would take one week or more on a ship.
Problems.
Sometimes, people are scared to fly. However, statistics show they are safer than cars. The September 11, 2001 attacks helped spread this fear of flying.
