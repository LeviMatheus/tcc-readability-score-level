A vein is a blood vessel running throughout the body. Through veins blood flows to the heart.
A vein has a large lumen, and less pressure as there is smaller amounts of smooth muscle and elastic fibres.
Veins carry blood to the heart and enter the heart through the vena cava, other main veins are the colonary vein and renal vein.
