Hydroelectricity is electricity that is made by the movement of water. It is usually made with dams that block a river or collect water that is pumped there. When the water is "let go" the huge pressure behind the dam forces the water down shafts that lead to a turbine, this causes the turbine to turn, and electricity is produced.
Advantages of hydroelectricity are that the way in which electricity is produced harms the environment less than fossil fuels like oil. Hydroelectricity is safe and produces no waste.
Hydroelectricity is also useful when electricity is needed very quickly. Water that has been stored in a dam can be "let go" when needed, so the energy needed can be made quickly. hydroelectricity will never become extinct because of our water supply. The advantages of hydroelectricity is once the dam is built the electricity is free,no waste or pollution produced and electricity can be generated constantly.
Disadvantages are that dams can harm the land and animals around them and some people say that they just do not look good.
