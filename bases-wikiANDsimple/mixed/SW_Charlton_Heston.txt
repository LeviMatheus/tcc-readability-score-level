Charlton Heston (October 4, 1923 â€“ April 5, 2008) was an American actor. He had many big roles, such as playing Moses in the film "The Ten Commandments", astronaut Colonel George Taylor in the film "Planet of the Apes", and the Academy Award-winning role of Judah Ben-Hur in the film "Ben-Hur".
Heston was also known for his politics. When he was young he held liberal views and marched with people such as Martin Luther King, Jr. for civil rights in the 1960s. It was rare for a Hollywood actor to be for such causes at that time. Later in his life, he was for conservative causes such as gun rights. He was president of the National Rifle Association, a group that is for the rights of gun owners, from 1998 to 2003.
Late in his life, Heston had Alzheimer's disease. He died in 2008 of pneumonia.
