The Columbine High School Massacre was a murder/suicide at Columbine High School near Denver, Colorado on April 20, 1999.
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, two students at the school, came to school armed with shotguns and assault rifles. They walked through the school firing randomly at other students and teachers. Before killing themselves, they killed 12 students and a teacher, and hurt 24 other students.
It was one of the first well-known massacres at a school in the United States, and the one with the most deaths until the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.
