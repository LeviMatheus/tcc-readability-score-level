The British Grand Prix is a car race normally held in Silverstone in Northamptonshire but it has been held at other racing circuits including Brands Hatch in Kent.
From 2010 it is going to be held at Donnington.
It started in 1926 by Henry Seagrave after he won both the French Grand Prix in 1923 and the Spanish Grand Prix the next year. This made Formula One racing popular in the UK.
