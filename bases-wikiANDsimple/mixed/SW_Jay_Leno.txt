Jay Leno (born James Douglas Muir on April 28, 1950) is an American comedian who works on late night television. He has been host of "The Tonight Show" since 1992, when Johnny Carson decided not to do it anymore. In 2007, during the writer's strike, Leno was on the side of the writers. After two months he went back to the show because he had paying wages to his staff (since there was no work) and could no longer pay them.
He guest-starred in the "Nickelodeon" TV series "The Fairly OddParents" as the "Crimson Chin" twice, his character's name emphasizes the fact that Leno has a large and square chin.
