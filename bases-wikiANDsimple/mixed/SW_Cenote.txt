A cenote (pronounced in Mexican Spanish and in English, plural: cenotes; from Yucatec Maya "dzonot") is a type of sinkhole that contains groundwater. It is typical in the Yucatán Peninsula and some nearby Caribbean islands. The term comes from a word used by the low-land Maya to refer to any location where groundwater is accessible.
Definition and description.
Cenotes are surface connections to subterranean water bodies. While the most well-known cenotes are large open water pools measuring tens of metres in diameter, such as those at Chichén Itzá, the greatest number of cenotes are smaller sheltered sites and do not necessarily have any surface exposed water. The term cenote has also been used to describe similar karst features in other countries such as Cuba and Australia, in addition to the more generic term of sinkholes.
Cenote water is often very clear, as the water comes from rain water infiltrating slowly through the ground. The groundwater flow rate within a cenote may be very slow at velocities ranging from 1 to 1000 meters per year. Cenotes around the world attract cave divers who have documented extensive flooded cave systems through them, some of which have been explored for lengths of 100 kilometers or more.
