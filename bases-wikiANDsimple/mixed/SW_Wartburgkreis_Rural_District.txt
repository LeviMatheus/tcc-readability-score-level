Wartburgkreis is a "Landkreis" (rural district) in the west of Thuringia, Germany. The city of Eisenach is nearly completely surrounded by Wartburgbreis.
History.
The district was set up in 1994 by joining the old districts of Eisenach and Bad Salzungen, and a few municipalities from the district Bad Langensalza. The city of Eisenach left the district in 1998 and became a district-free city.
The district is named after the Wartburg, a castle near Eisenach most famous as Martin Luther's refuge in 1521.
