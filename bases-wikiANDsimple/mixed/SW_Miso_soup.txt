Miso soup (味噌汁"misoshiru" in Japanese) is a traditional Japanese soup. It is made from a stock called "dashi" into which softened miso is dissolved. Various solid ingredients like wakame, seaweed, tofu from soybeans, and mushrooms are then added to make the finished soup. The soup is usually served in lacquer bowls with lids and drunk directly from the bowl. Solid ingredients are eaten with chopsticks. Different types of miso produce distinctive soups.
