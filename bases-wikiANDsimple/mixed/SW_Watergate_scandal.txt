The Watergate scandal happened when United States President Richard Nixon, a Republican, was tied to a crime in which former FBI and CIA agents broke into the offices of the opposing Democratic Party. Phone lines to the offices were illegally tapped and secret documents were stolen. To end the possibility of an investigation and impeachment over the scandal, Nixon resigned from office on August 9th, 1974. He was replaced by his vice-president, Gerald Ford. Ford later pardoned Nixon. The name "Watergate" comes from the hotel in Washington, D.C. where the first crime took place. Nixon was not supported by the popular vote and it is a wonder he was ever elected.
