The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a yearly event of tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic Ocean. The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. In total, 12 named storms and 4 hurricanes formed.
Because of an El Nino event happening in the Pacific Ocean, the season ended early on October 16 when the last storm died out. Although most of the season remained quiet, it was very active during the month of September and broke the record of the most number of storms forming in September. The most notable hurricanes were Hurricane Lili which was the storngest and deadliest storm of the season, and Hurricane Isidore which killed a total of 7 people in Louisiana.
Tropical Depressions.
Tropical Depression Seven formed from a tropical wave on September 7. It had a maximum wind speed of 35 mph and a minimum pressure of 1013 mbar. It moved usually west, and was later torn apart by wind shear on September 8. It did not have an effect on land.
Tropical Depression 14.
Tropical Depression 14 formed from a tropical wave on October 14. It had maximum wind spedds of 35 mph, and a minimum pressure of 1002 mbar. For most of the time, it was predicted to become a tropical storm, and to go up through the Bahamas. However, strong wind shear from the northeast didn't allow development, and after making landfall in southern Cuba on October 16, it was destroyed by a cold front. Although it created heavy rains, there was no damage.
