Sir Karl Raimund Popper (July 28, 1902 – September 17, 1994) was an Austrian and British philosopher and a professor at the London School of Economics.
He is counted among the most influential philosophers of science of the 20th century, and also wrote a lot on social and political philosophy. Popper is known for the idea of empirical falsification.
Life.
Karl Popper was born in Vienna (then in Austria-Hungary) in 1902 to middle-class parents of Jewish origins, both of whom had converted to Christianity. Popper received a Lutheran upbringing and was educated at the University of Vienna.. His father had 12,000-14,000 volumes in his personal library.
In 1919 he became attracted by Marxism and therefore joined the Association of Socialist School Students and also became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, which was at that time a party that fully adopted the marxist ideology. He soon became disillusioned, abandoned the ideology and remained a passive supporter of social liberalism throughout his life.
