The Lahore Resolution ("Qarardad-e-Lahore" قرارداد لاھور), commonly known as the Pakistan Resolution (قرارداد پاکستان "Qarardad-e-Pakistan"), was a political statement adopted by the Muslim League at its three-day general session on 22-24 March 1940 that called for greater Muslim autonomy in British India. Most people thought of this as a call for a separate Muslim state, Pakistan. The resolution was presented by A. K. Fazlul Huq.
