Djibouti is a country in Africa. Djibouti gained its independence on June 27, 1977. The country was created out of the French Somaliland (later called the French Territory of the Afars and Issas), which was created in the 1800s as a result of French colonialism in Africa. However, the history of Djibouti goes back thousands of years when it was part of the Sabean Empire (Ethiopia) to a time when Djiboutians traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient Egypt, India, and China. Through close contacts with the Arabian peninsula for more than 1,000 years, the Somali and Afar tribes in this region became among the first on the African continent to accept Islam. Djibouti is a Muslim country which regularly takes part in Islamic as well as Arab meetings. Djibouti used to be Ethiopian territory before french accupation after it got its independence. Djibouiti decided to be a country of its own with good friendship with its neighbouring country of Ethiopia.
The country is close to a narrow part of the Red Sea so it is considered an important area from a military viewpoint.
