18 Melpomene is a big, bright Main belt asteroid. It is made of silicates and metals.
It was found by J. R. Hind on June 24, 1852 and named after Melpomene, the Muse of tragedy in Greek mythology.
Melpomene occulted the star SAO 114159 on December 11, 1978. A possible moon of Melpomene with a diameter at least 37 km was detected. The moon candidate got a designation S/1978 (18) 1.
Melpomene was seen with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1993. It was able to resolve the asteroid's slightly stretched shape, but no moons were detected.
