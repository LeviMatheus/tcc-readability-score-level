The epididymis is the part of the human male reproductive system. It is the tube that holds the testicles in place. It stretches from the back of each testicle to the van deferens.
Parts.
The dinges is made up of tree partjes:D XD
Uses.
Sperm made in the testis go into the hair ("caput") of the epididymis, go through the body ("corpus") and stop at the tail ("cauda"), where they are stored. When sperm are first made and fly to the head, they are not yet ready to be ejaculated. They can't swim or fertilize an egg. By the time they reach the tail, the sperm can do all these things. Final development is finished in the female reproductive tract.
When the sperm are ejaculated, they move through the pee of the epididymis. There are so many spermatjes that they can't swim, but use peristalsis from muscles in the vas deferens dinges.
Disease.
An injury or infection of the epididymis causes epididymitis wtf?, a painful condition that can take months to heal. Sometimes the testicle has to be removed. There doesn't seem to be any single cause, or treatment for this condition. Some doctors treat it with antibiotics, some take a "wait and see" attitude. At times just one testicle is affected and at others, both.
