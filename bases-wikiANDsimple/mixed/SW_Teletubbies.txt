Teletubbies is a BAFTA award winning BBC television show for toddlers. The main characters are Tinky Winky, who is purple, Dipsy, who is green, Laa-Laa, who is yellow, and Po, who is red.
In the show, the four colourful Teletubbies play in the cheerful and fun Teletubbyland. They do things that little children like to do, such as rolling on the ground, laughing, running about, and watching real children on the televisions on their bellies. Mysterious pinwheels and telephones rise out of the meadow to show the days' activities. The Sun, who has a baby's face, makes baby noises during the show, and it rises and sets to begin and end the show.
