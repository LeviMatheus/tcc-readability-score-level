The Mass Rapid Transit or MRT (Chinese: 大众快速交通 or more commonly known as 地铁; Malay: "Sistem Pengangkutan Gerak Cepat"; Tamil: சிங்கை துரிதக் கடவு ரயில்) is a train system in Singapore.
The MRT is a system which links the different places of the country together using a network, or different lines, of trains. When a person travels from one place to another, he or she goes up a train in a train station and then moves in it with other passengers until the train reaches the place he or she wants to come off, or alight. Sometimes he or she has to change trains.
About 1.3 million passengers use the MRT. The system is 109.4 km long and has 64 stations. The trains run from 5:30 am to 1:00 am every day. A train comes every 3-5 minutes in peak hours, and every 7 minutes during off-peak hours. It is operated by the Singapore's SMRT Corporation and SBS Transit.
There are currently 3 lines in the MRT system, where they are connected by special stops called interchanges. A new line called the Circle Line is going to be finished.
Expansion.
The MRT system had been using its two main lines, the North South and East West Lines, for more than a decade until the opening of the North East Line in 2003. While plans for these lines, as well as those that are under construction, were formed long before, the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) publication of a white paper entitled "A World Class Land Transport System" in 1996 showed the government's intentions to greatly expand on the existing system. The plans allow for the long-term replacement of the bus network by rail-based transportation as the main way of public transportation. It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to over 160 in 10 to 15 years, and expected further expansion in the longer term. By 2030, the government foresees a rail network of 540 kilometres — more extensive than London's 408-kilometre Tube system.
On 25 January 2008, the government announced plans to accelerate the MRT's expansion plans. This included bringing forward the building of the new Thomson Line and Eastern Region Line, extension of the North South Line by a kilometre farther into the New Downtown and the extension of the East West Line by 14-kilometres into Tuas. The Circle Line will be opened earlier, with the Stage Three segment between Bishan MRT Station and Serangoon MRT Station opened by the middle of 2009. The Thomson and West Coast stations, initially to be opened at a later date, will open together with their neighbouring stations. The Circle Line will also be extended south to connect to the Marina Bay MRT Station. Finally, the Downtown Line's Stage Three will have its completion date moved forward from 2018 to 2016. It was anticipated that by 2020, the rail network would have grown to 278 kilometres from the current 138 kilometres, with ridership expected to rise from the current 1.4 million to 4.6 million daily. The network density will also rise from the current 31 to 51 kilometres per million population, putting it on par with the networks in London and New York, while exceeding those in Hong Kong and Tokyo.
Circle Line.
Currently under construction in five stages, the 33.3-kilometre Circle Line (CCL) will be the next major rail line to open after the North East Line began operating on June 20 2003. When completed, the line will connect all existing MRT lines, and will allow commuters to bypass the downtown area, reducing congestion especially at the City Hall and Raffles Place interchange stations. The Circle Line was originally scheduled to open in stages from 2007 to 2010, but when a section of tunnel near the planned Nicoll Highway station collapsed on 20 April 2004 during its construction and caused the death of four workers, the completion of the first stations was then announced to be postponed to 2010. The line was then planned to be opened in two phases - Stages 1 to 3 stretching from Dhoby Ghaut to Marymount stations to be opened by late 2010, and the final two states by 2011.
On 14 June 2005, the Land Transport Authority announced a new 3.4-kilometre, five-station branch line, then known as the "Downtown Extension", linking the Promenade station on the Circle Line to the Chinatown station on the North East Line. By 27 April 2007, however, the Downtown Extension was rebranded as Stage 1 of the new Downtown MRT Line (DTL), and no longer considered part of the Circle Line. A new branch line parallel to the DTL's Stage 1 was announced to link the Promenade and Bayfront Stations instead, with completion by 2012. On 25 January 2008, it was announced that that the branch line will be farther extended to the Marina Bay Station, with completion of both stations remaining at 2012. The announcement also confirmed that Stage 3 of the Circle Line from the Bartley to Marymount stations will have their opening brought forward to mid-2009 and the other four stages by 2010.
