A rod, a perch or a pole is a unit of length in the imperial and US systems.
In medi√¶val times English ploughmen used wooden a stick with a pointed tip to spur or guide their oxen. The rod was the length of this stick. In 1607 Edmund Gunter standardised this length.
The rod is still in use as a unit of measure in certain specialised fields. In recreational canoeing, overland paths where canoes must be carried are measured in rods. This is probably because the length of a typical canoe is about one rod. In the United Kingdom, the some gardens are measured in rods.
Popular culture and trivia.
In the episode of "The Simpsons" entitled "A Star is Burns", Grampa Simpson said "My car gets forty rods to the hogshead, and that's the way I likes it!" That's about 1.2 litres per metre, 12 feet per imperial gallon or 10 feet per U.S. gallon.
