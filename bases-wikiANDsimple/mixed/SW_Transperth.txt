Transperth is the name of the brand of the public transport system in Perth, Western Australia. Transperth is launched in 1986. It supplies public bus, train and ferry services.
Train services run on four lines that spread over the Perth metropolitan area. The lines are named Joondalup, Midland, Fremantle and Armadale. The new Mandurah line will be open late in 2007. All trains are operated using electricity.
Bus services run throughout the metropolitan area. A notable bus route is the CircleRoute which links major shopping centres, universities and railway stations in a circle.
Ferry services operate across the Swan River between the Perth CBD and South Perth. The ferry is popular for people to go to the Perth Zoo located in South Perth.
Passengers can take rides by buying cash tickets or using the ticket system known as "SmartRider".
