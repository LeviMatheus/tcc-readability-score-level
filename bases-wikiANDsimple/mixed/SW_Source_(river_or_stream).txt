The source of a river or stream is the original point from which the river flows.
The source of a river or stream may be a lake, a marsh, a spring or a glacier.
The farthest stream is called the headstream or headwater. The source is the farthest point of the river stream from its estuary or its confluence with another river or stream.
Where a river is fed by more than one source, it is usual to regard the highest as its source.
