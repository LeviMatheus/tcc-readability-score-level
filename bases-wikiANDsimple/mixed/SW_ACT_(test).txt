The ACT is an achievement test for college admissions in the United States made by ACT, Inc. It was first given in Fall 1959 by Everett Franklin Lindquist as a competitor to the College Board's Scholastic Aptitude Test, now the SAT Reasoning Test. Some students who perform poorly on the SAT find that they perform better on the ACT and vice versa. The ACT test is made of 4 tests: English, Math, Reading, and Science reasoning. In February 2005, an optional writing test was added to the ACT, like changes to the SAT that took place later in March of the same year. All four-year colleges and universities in the U.S. accept the ACT.
