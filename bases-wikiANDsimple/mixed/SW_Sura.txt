Sura (sometimes spelt "Surah" ('), plural "Suwar") is an Arabic term that means literally "something enclosed or surrounded by a fence or wall."
Sura means a "chapter" of the Qur'an. They are traditionally ordered in order of length and begin with the shortest. Each Sura is named for a word or name mentioned in an ayah (section), of that 'Sura'.
