An oil lamp is a lamp used for lighting. Usually, it produces a flame by burning olive oil, or other vegetable oil. The designs were usually made of potterry or metallic lamps. This design might remind someone that by cleaning (rubbing the lamp) a Genie might appear, and grant some wishes (as he did in the tale of Aladdin in the 1001 Nights)
Today, those lamps have mostly been replaced by kerosene lamps.
