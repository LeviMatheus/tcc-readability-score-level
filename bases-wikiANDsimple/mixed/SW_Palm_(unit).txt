A palm'", when used as a unit of length, is usually four digits ("fingers") or three inches, i.e. 7.62 cm (for the international inch).
In English this unit is no longer in use as other units that are based on the human arm: digit (Â¼ palm), finger (7/24 palm), hand (4/3 palms), shaftment (2 palms), span (3 palms), cubit (6 palms) and ell (15 palms).
