Down syndrome (also called Down's syndrome or trisomy 21; old name "mongoloid idiocy") is a genetic disorder. It comes from a problem with the genes. Humans are diploid organisms. This means that for each chromosome, there are two copies, one from the mother, and one from the father. During meiosis the number is reduced to one set of chromosomes. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21, or part of it. They suffer a mild mental retardation - they are usually not as intelligent as those people without it.
Children who have this condition take more time to learn new things. They also grow differently from other children. Babies with Down syndrome can be identified at birth because they look a little different from other babies. The condition is named after John Langdon Down, the British doctor who first described it in 1866. He called it "mongoloid idiocy", but that term is no longer used today.
Doctors in the UK usually inform others that people with the condition have a mild to medium learning difficulty. (In the USA the word retarded is still used, but this is a very rude word in other English speaking countries.) Some people with the condition have average intelligence, but may have other problems with development instead. People with Down syndrome often have a different shape of eyes than most people. A few people with the condition have severe learning difficulties.
Of every 800 to 1000 babies that are born, one is diagnosed with Down syndrome.
