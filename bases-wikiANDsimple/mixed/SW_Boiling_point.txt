The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the substance boils, or enters a state of rapid evaporation. For water this is 100° Celsius or 212° Fahrenheit.
where ΔTB.P. = change in boiling point,
Kb = a constant (this is.56 for water), and
"m" = molality of the solute.
The boiling point of a liquid also depends on the pressure of the surrounding air. An increase in air pressure increases the boiling point; a decrease decreases the boiling point. In the low pressure environment at the top of Mt Everest for example, water boils at only 69 °C. (156.2 °F).
