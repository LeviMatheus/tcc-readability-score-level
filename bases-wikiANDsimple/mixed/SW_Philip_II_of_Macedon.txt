Philip II was a king of Macedon. He ruled from 359 BC - 336 BC. He was the father of the emperor Alexander the Great, who was born in 356 BC. He united all of Greece. He would either bring a city-state into his empire with his military or he would talk/bribe the leaders into joining his empire. It was under his reign in 338 BC at Chaerona against Athens that Alexander first showed his military genius.
