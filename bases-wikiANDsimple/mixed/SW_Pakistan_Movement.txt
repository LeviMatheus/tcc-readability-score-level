The Pakistan Movement (also called Tehrik-e-Pakistan, Urdu: تحریک پاکستان) was was a political movement which was active during the first hald of the 20th century. At that time, British India belonged to Great Britain. In British India, most people were Hindu, and only very few were Muslim. The people who made the movement feared they would lose their liberty when the English left. They therefore wanted to create a separate state. This struggle was led by the Muslim League and resulted in the partition of the British Empire in India. The movement was led by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Other important leaders were Allama Iqbal, Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, Fatimah Jinnah, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, A.K. Fazlul Huq, and Sardar Abdur Rab Nishtar.
History of the movement.
The first person who had the idea of a separate state was Allama Iqbal in 1930. Choudhary Rahmat Ali proposed the name Pakistan in his Pakistan Declaration in 1933. People like Muhammad Ali Jinnah maintained their belief in religious unity. Religious hostilities between Hindus and Muslims gave the movement a stronger backing.
In 1940 during its meeting in Lahore, the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (also known as Pakistan Resolution) that asked for an independent state of Pakistan. Soon after World War II, the United Kingdom became convinced that they would not be able to keep their colonies in South Asia, as the British Empire suffered very badly from the war. By 1947, British India was divided into a Muslim majority Pakistan and a Hindu majority India. Bangladesh split form Pakistan in 1971.
