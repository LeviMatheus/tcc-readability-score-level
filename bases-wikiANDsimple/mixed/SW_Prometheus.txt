Prometheus was a Titan in Greek mythology. He stole fire from Zeus and gave it to the humans. As punishment, Zeus had Prometheus chained to a mountain. Every day an eagle would come and eat his liver. Every night, his liver would grow back. He is immortal, so he never dies, but it is still great pain that he gets for making the gods angry. After a long time, Zeus sent his son Heracles to free Prometheus by breaking the chains which held him.
