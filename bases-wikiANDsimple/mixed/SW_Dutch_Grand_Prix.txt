The Dutch Grand Prix was a Formula One automobile race held at Circuit Zandvoort, from 1952 to 1985.
1985 was its final running, as the company that commercially ran the circuit (CENAV) went out of business, marking the end of Circuit Zandvoort. The track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoort, was not used for some time and part of the grounds and approximately half of the track was sold in 1987 to Vendorado, a Bungalow park developer at that time.
