Overview.
Haines City High School belongs to the Polk County School Board and is a member of Polk District Schools. Haines City High School was the original high school in the city, opening in 1922. In the fall of 2005, a new school called Ridge Community High School opened, becoming Haines City High School's new rival (the old one being Lake Wales High School).
