Paramilitary is a way to describe forces that are organised like military forces, but that do not have the same status. Examples for such forces would be police forces guarding the borders of a country. There are paramilitary groups that are run by a country, and others that are not.
The name comes from Greek "para" (which means "beside") and Latin "miles" (which means "soldier").
