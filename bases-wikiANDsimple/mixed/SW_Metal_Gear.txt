"Metal Gear" is an action-adventure video game series made by Konami since 1987. This series of video games are more about not being seen and hiding in order to win - getting into fights can make you lose.
The main character of the 'Metal Gear' games is named Solid Snake. He is a soldier who does sneaking (hiding) missions by himself, much like James Bond. He is a clone of a famous soldier named Big Boss. The games have a large amount of story about these two men and the things that happen to them. Many players say the games are like watching a James Bond movie or reading a book about spies.
The series is named after a type of robotic tank that is in every game. These robots are very dangerous and Solid Snake makes it his job to stop them.
The latest game, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots has been made by Konami for the Playstation 3
