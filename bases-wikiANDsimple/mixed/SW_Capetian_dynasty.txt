The Capetian Dynasty includes any of the direct descendants of Hugh Capet of France. King Juan Carlos of Spain and the grand duke of Luxembourg are members of this family, both through the Bourbon branch of the dynasty.
The "direct Capetians" ruled France from the years 987 - 1328. After that the junior House of Valois ruled France until 1589, and the House of Bourbon ruled until the revolution of 1792.
