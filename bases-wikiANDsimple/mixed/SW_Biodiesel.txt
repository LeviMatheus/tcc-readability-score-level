Biodiesel is a type of fuel prepared by modifying vegetable oil.
In Brazil, castor beans are the best stuff to make biodiesel out of, because they're easier to plant and cost less than soybeans, sunflower seeds or other seeds.
In Germany biodiesel is, for the most part, produced from rapeseeds.
Biodiesel is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states in the US.
In Thailand, the raw material will most likely come from palm oil, coconut oil, "Jatropha curcas", and tallow.
Biofuel prepared from biomass is different since it is not transesterified oil.
