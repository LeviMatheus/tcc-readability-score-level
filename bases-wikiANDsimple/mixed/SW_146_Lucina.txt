146 Lucina is a main belt asteroid. It is big, dark and is made of carbonates.
It was found by Alphonse Borrelly on June 8, 1875 and named after Lucina, the Roman goddess of childbirth.
Two stellar occultations by Lucina have been seen so far, in 1982 and 1989. During the first event, a possible small moon (6 km in diameter) was detected.
Further evidence for a moon came in 2003, this time based on astrometric measurements.
