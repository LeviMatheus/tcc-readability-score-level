A fact is something that is true or real, or something that can be shown to be true or real.
A fact is something correct.
Facts and Opinions.
A fact is not the same as an opinion. An opinion is perceived and assumed to be true, but without proof or evidence. The Scientific Method is a means by which an opinion may be tested. However, not all opinions are testable and therefore may not be known to be true and remain merely an opinion until such time as a means to verify their truth is devised.
