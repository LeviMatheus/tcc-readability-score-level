In financial markets, stock is the capital that a firm gets by giving out and distributing of shares.
A person or organization which holds "shares" of stocks is called a shareholder. The whole value of the stocks that a firm has issued is called its market capitalization.
In the United Kingdom and Australia, the term "share" is used the same way as "stock" is described in the United States.
