History.
Nintendo was formed on September 23, 1889. They began making video games only in the 1980s. Nintendo's first video game console was the Famicom. Famicom was first only released in Japan but it was later released in some other areas, such as North America. When they released it in there, its name was changed to "Nintendo Entertainment System", or NES for short. They also released some popular stand-alone video games, with names like the arcade game "Donkey Kong", and NES games "Super Mario Bros.", "Duck Hunt", and "The Legend of Zelda".
Today.
Today, Nintendo has many popular characters and series. "Super Mario Bros.", and "The Legend of Zelda" are examples of these.
Nintendo currently makes the Wii, Nintendo DS, Game Boy Micro and Game Boy Advance SP video game consoles. Wii and GameCube plug in to a TV and are called "home consoles", because they are used most of the time at home. Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Micro and Nintendo DS are small and have their own screens. They are called "handhelds", because they can be taken anywhere.
