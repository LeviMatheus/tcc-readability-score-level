Nicola Rachele-Beth Grahame (born April 28, 1982) from Watford, Hertfordshire rose to fame in the UK when she was chosen to be a housemate on "Big Brother 7" in 2006. A former model and promotions girl, Grahame has become renowned for throwing temper tantrums â€” behaviour that divided viewer opinion during her time on Big Brother and subsequently led to her being given her own reality television show entitled Princess Nikki.
