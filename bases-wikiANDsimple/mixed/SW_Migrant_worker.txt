A migrant worker is someone who regularly works away from home, if they even have a home.
Although the United Nations' use of this term overlaps with 'foreign worker', the use of the term within the United States is more specific. In the United States, the term is most commonly used to describe low-wage workers performing manual labor in the agriculture field.
