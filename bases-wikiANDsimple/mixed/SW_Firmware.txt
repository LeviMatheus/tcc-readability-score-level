In computing, firmware is a computer program that is "embedded" in a hardware device, for example a microcontroller. It can also be provided on flash memory or as a binary image file that can be uploaded onto existing hardware by a user. Some firmware can also be modded or changed by some really ordinary computer users through curious tools.
As its name suggests, firmware is somewhere between hardware and software, neither too hard or soft. Like software, it is a computer program which is executed by a microprocessor or a microcontroller. But it is also linked to a piece of hardware and has no meaning without it.
In the past, firmware was stored in ROMs but now it is stored in non-volatile media such as EEPROMs and Flashs.
Firmware in many devices such as routers can now be updated without the need for additional hardware, often by downloading a new version from web to update the device, using instructions provided by the device manufacturer.
The easiest firmware to update is typically the system boot-related firmware, such as the BIOS in PCs. Some devices, such as video adapters and modems, frequently rely on firmware that is loaded by the operating system device drivers, and thus is updated by the operating system not by the user. Some computer viruses and hackers use operating system firmware update facilities to corrupt the firmware. An electronic device is said to be "bricked" if it is unable to start due to firmware issues.
