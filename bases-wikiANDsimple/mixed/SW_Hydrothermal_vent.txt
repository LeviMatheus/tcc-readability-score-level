A hydrothermal vent (which is also called Black Smoker) is a fissure in the surface of the Earth. There are gases that rise through it, and that heat the water around it. There are many such vents on Earth. If they are on land, they are usually hot springs, geysers, or fumaroles. Many Archea live near hydrothermal vents. These Archea support Giant tube worms, clams and shrimp.
