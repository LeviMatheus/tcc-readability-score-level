Impressionism was a style of art that started in the 1800s. The features of this style are: large, visible brushstrokes; plain, everyday objects and places; movement; strange angles; and a focus on the changing angles of light. Many Impressionist artists preferred to paint outdoors. Some of the most famous Impressionist artists were Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul Cezanne, and Camille Pissarro. Paris was the center of Impressionism, and artists who wanted to paint in this style lived or moved there.
The word Impressionism can mean any painting done in this style, but people most often use it to talk about these artists and that time period.
