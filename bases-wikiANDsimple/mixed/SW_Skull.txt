A skull, or cranium, is a set of bones that make up the head of a vertebrate and keep in place all body parts in the head. Its hard bones keeps the brain safe. Inside the skull are air pockets called sinuses, which act like cushions for the brain. When you have a headache in your forehead, it is usually because the sinuses are filled with fluid due to allergies.
In humans, the adult skull is normally made up of 28 bones. A skull is also used as a symbol of poison when used in conjunction with crossbones.
