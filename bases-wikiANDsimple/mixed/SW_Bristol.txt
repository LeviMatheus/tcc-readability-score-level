Bristol is a city in the United Kingdom. It is home to nearly 500,000 people. The River Avon runs through it to the Severn estuary.
It is between the counties of Gloucestershire and Somerset. In 1373, King Edward the Third ordered that it should be a county itself forever. However it lost county status in 1974, the year after its 600-year celebrations, becoming the largest district within the new Avon county. Avon was never popular and was abolished in 1996, when county status returned to Bristol, which became a unitary council.
The Bristol name means "the place where the bridge is" in Old English. It has been a port for 800 years, but now ships are too big to reach it. It has a new seaport at Avonmouth.
It has many historic churches and other buildings. The Clifton Suspension Bridge crosses high above the river.
Bristol was a centre for the slave trade.
Bristol was badly damaged during World War II. It now has many new factories and offices. The Concorde supersonic airliner was made here.
