Black's Law Dictionary is the most widely used law dictionary in the United States. Henry Campbell Black (1860â€“1927) was the author of the first two editions of the dictionary. However, it remains an abridged dictionary with pronunciation guides and slight reference material.
History.
The first edition was published in 1891 by West Publishing, while the second edition was published in 1910. The sixth and earlier editions of the book additionally provided case citations for the term cited, which was viewed by lawyers as its most useful feature, providing a useful starting point with leading cases. The invention of the Internet made legal research easier therefore many state- or circuit-specific case citations and outdated or overruled case citations were omitted from the seventh edition in 1999. The eighth edition introduced a unique system of perpetually updated case citations and cross-references to legal encyclopedias. The current edition is the eleventh, published in 2019.
As many legal terms are derived from a Latin root word, the dictionary provides a pronunciation guide for such terms. In addition, the applicable entries provide pronunciation transcriptions pursuant to those found among North American practitioners of law or medicine.
