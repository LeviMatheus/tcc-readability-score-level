The Airbus A320 is an airplane made by multi-national company Airbus that first flew in 1987. At the most, it can hold about 180 passengers. Other versions have space for between 105 and 220 seats. First delivered in 1988, the A320 was one of the first aircraft to use digital fly-by-wire flight control systems in a commercial aircraft. With more than 3,000 aircraft of the A320 family built, it is the second best-selling jet airliner family of all time after the Boeing 737.
The A320 has been involved in several accidents—some of these have killed a lot of people. The worst accident happened in 2007 when a TAM Airlines Airbus A320 crashed when it landed in São Paulo in Brazil during heavy rain. The crash killed almost 200 people. The A320 has also had a number of accidents involving the undercarriage.
Development.
The A320 was the world's first commercial jet to use a small joystick, also called a "sidestick", to fly it instead of a normal yoke (a steering-wheel like device). This matched the new digital 'fly-by-wire' system, the first use of this in a civilian aircraft, which makes the A320 much easier and safer to fly.
The A320 also has a full "glass-cockpit", where most instruments in the cockpit (the front part of the plane where the pilot is) have been replaced by television screens. Most of the technology first used on the A320 has been used in other Airbus aircraft made afterwards. Other manufacturers, like Boeing, have also used much of the technology like a glass-cockpit and fly-by-wire in the Boeing 777.
Engines.
The A319, A320 and A321 have engines made by two different companies; International Aero Engines (IAE) supply the V2500 and CFM International provide the CFM56. Over 70% of the A320 family have IAE engines.
The significantly smaller A318 has either Pratt and Whitney PW6000 engines or CFM56-5. The PW6000 was not as good as expected and this may have reduced the number of sales; several airlines cancelled their orders before the more efficient CFM engine arrived.
Types== .
The A320 has been shortened to produce the A319 and stretched to produce the A321. Recently it was shortened even more to make the A318. However this version has not sold as well and the only large operator is Frontier Airlines.
These different versions are known as "A320 derivatives". When talking about all of them, they are known as the "A320 family" or "A32x".
Changes in size are done by removing or adding sections of fuselage (the part of the aircraft passengers sit in) and adjusting the power of the engines. Airbus try to keep the airplanes the same where possible, to reduce operating costs.
Pilots only need one licence (called a type-rating) to fly all A320 derivatives.
Accidents and problems.
Seven incidents of nose gear malfunction, including JetBlue Airways Flight 292.
