Chrysler is a car manufacturer based in the United States. They are one of the oldest car manufacturers in the world. They own other car companies such as Dodge and Jeep.
It was created by Walter P. Chrysler in 1925 when he renamed the Maxwell Motor Company. From 1998 to 2007, Chrysler was part of DiamlerChrysler, a large German company. It is now owned by Cerberus Capital Management. Chrysler may become bankrupt if it does not receive money from the U.S. government. In 1979, Chrysler had similar problems. They got 1.5 billion dollars from the U.S. government. Lee Iacocca became CEO. Then, Chrysler created the K-car platform, invented the minivan, and sold many trucks to the army. They slowly recovered.
At its peak, Chrysler owned Dodge, Jeep, Plymouth, DeSoto, Valiant, Imperial, and Eagle (AMC). Only Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep survived.
