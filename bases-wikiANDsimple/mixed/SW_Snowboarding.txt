Snowboarding is a sport in which a person stands on a "snowboard" and rides down a slope covered with snow. It is like skiing, except both feet are on one board, instead of one board ("ski") for each foot. The types of jumps you can do are: Indy, 180, nosegrab, tailwhip, front/side 180,and backside 180.
