Puducherry, which used to be called Pondicherry is a Union Territory of India. Pondicherry is divided into four separate parts: Pondicherry, Karaikal, Yanam, and Mahé.
These four areas are under one name because they were all once ruled by the French. Chandannagar, the fifth former French colony located 30 kilometers north of Kolkata, in West Bengal, India, is now outside this unconnected territory.
When India took control of them, they took them in as one territory. Pondicherry is going through a name change to Puduchery, which means "new village" in the local language. It covers an area of 183 sq mi or 474 km², it is bigger than Andorra but smaller than Saint Lucia.
