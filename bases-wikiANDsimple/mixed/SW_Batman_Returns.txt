"Batman Returns" was the second major Batman film produced, and the second (and final) Batman film directed by Tim Burton.
The film features Batman (Michael Keaton) confronting a horribly deformed interpretation of The Penguin (Danny DeVito) who is working with corrupt businessman Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) to become mayor of Gotham City while fufilling a secret vendetta. At the same time, Batman must also confront the mysterious anti-hero Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer).
The film was widely considered to be one of the darkest interpretations of the character to date, leading in part to Tim Burton not being called back to direct "Batman Forever", the 1995 sequel to the film.
