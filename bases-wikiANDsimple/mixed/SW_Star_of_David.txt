The Star of David (Hebrew:מָגֵן דָּוִד, or Māġēn Dāwīd, pronounced in ancient Hebrew, and in Modern Hebrew) is a Jewish symbol. It is named after King David of Israel. It is very famous. The star consists of a triangle, overlapped by another, "upside-down" triangle. It is unknown how this came to be a symbol of Judaism, but it was first used in the Middle Ages. It is used on the flag of Israel, and was used by German National Socialists to identify Jews.
