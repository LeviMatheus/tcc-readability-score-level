In mathematics, a matrix (plural matrices) is a rectangular table of numbers. There are rules for adding, subtracting and "multiplying" matrices together. These rules sometimes lead to not so common properties, for example, if A and B are two matrices, it is not always true that formula_1 equals formula_2.
Many natural sciences use matrices quite a lot. In many universities, courses about matrices (usually called linear algebra) are taught very early, sometimes even in the first year of studies. Matrices are also widely used in computer science.
Definitions and notations.
The horizontal lines in a matrix are called rows and the vertical lines are called columns. A matrix with "m" rows and "n" columns is called an "m"-by-"n" matrix (or "m"×"n" matrix) and "m" and "n" are called its dimensions.
The places in the matrix where the numbers are, are called "entry". The entry of a matrix "A" that lies in the row number "i" and column number "j" is called the "i,j" entry of "A". This is written as "A"["i,j"] or "a'ij".
We write formula_3 to define an "m" × "n" matrix "A" with each entry in the matrix called "a'ij" for all 1 ≤ "i" ≤ "m" and 1 ≤ "j" ≤ "n".
Example.
is a 4×3 matrix. This matrix has m=4 rows, and n=3 columns.
The element "A"[2,3] or "a"23 is 7.
Addition.
The two matrices have the same dimensions. Here formula_6 is true.
Special matrices.
There are some matrices that are special.
Square matrix.
A square matrix has the same number of rows as columns, so m=n.
An example of a square matrix is
This matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns: m=n=3.
Identity matrix.
is an identity matrix. There is exactly one identity matrix for each dimension.
Inverse matrix.
formula_13 is the inverse of
formula_14.
One column matrix.
A matrix, that has many rows, but only one column, is called a column vector.
