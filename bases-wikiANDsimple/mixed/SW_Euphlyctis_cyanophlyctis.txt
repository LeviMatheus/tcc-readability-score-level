The Indian Skipper frog or Skittering frog ("Euphlyctis cyanophlyctis") is a common frog found in South Asia. They are slimy and are often seen at the edge of bodies of water with their eyes above the water. They noisily move away from the shore when disturbed, giving them their common name. They are rarely seen outside water.
