Melting is the process of changing something from a solid into a liquid (like ice into liquid water). It is the opposite of freezing. The temperature at which something begins to melt is called its melting point. When an object is heated, the object's particles begin to move faster and faster until the structured particles are freed. Now it is a liquid.
