The Philadelphia Phillies (or the Fightn' Phils) are a Major League Baseball team. They play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. They play in the National League East. The Phillies were started in 1883. Their manager is Charlie Manuel, and their general manager is Pat Gillick. The Phillies have kept their name and city for over 100 years. In 1980, the Phillies won their first and only World Series. In 1993, they made it once more to the series, but they lost. They didn't make the playoffs again until 2007, when they won the NL East division championship. However, they were swept by the Colorado Rockies in the NLDS. Their home uniforms are white with red pinstripes and a red hat with a white cursive "P". The hat is the same for them on the road, but they wear gray pants with one red stripe and a gray shirt.
