The Carp is a fish that lives in fresh water, such as rivers and lakes. In Europe and Asia carp are loved as a fishing and eating fish. However, carp are a really big problem in countries such as the U.S. and Australia. They cause the mud at the bottom of the river to move and in these countries people hate them.
Carp have been a source of food to humans, as well as popular ornamental fishes like the koi and goldfish.
