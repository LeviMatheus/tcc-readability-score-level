The Spanish Civil War (July 18, 1936â€“April 1, 1939) was a war in which the fascist Francisco Franco and his troops successfully took control of Spain. A lot of different groups worked together with the Spanish Republic (the government of the time) to stop him, including socialists, communists, anarchists, and other leftist groups. The fascist governments of Germany and Italy provided troops and supplies for Franco, while the Soviet Union sold the Republican forces weapons. Lots of people from other countries who did not like fascism volunteered to fight against Franco (sometimes against the orders of their own countries), including people from the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, and many other countries. These groups were known as the International Brigades. The war ended April 1, 1939 when the last of the Republican troops gave up. Franco became the ruler of Spain until he died in 1975.
On April 26, 1937 Guernica was bombed by Legion Condor, supported by Hitler's nazi regime. It was the first time that large civilian casualties resulted, the destruction received wide media coverage and created a public perception of German involvement which persists to this day.
