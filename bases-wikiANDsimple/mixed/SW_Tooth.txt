A tooth is one of the hard, white things in your mouth. Teeth (plural) are used to chew food. "Chew" means to break up and crush food so it can be swallowed (pushed down into your stomach). Some animals also use teeth as a weapon.
Tooth eruption.
Children have 20 teeth. The first teeth (called "primary teeth") start to "erupt" (come through the skin of the jaw) when a baby is 5-10 months old. When these teeth erupt it can hurt. Babies chew on things to make the pain better. This is called "teething" (verb infinitive: "to teethe"). Most children have all 20 teeth by 2 or 3 years of age. At age 6-7 the "permanent" teeth start to erupt. By the age of 11-12 most children have 28 adult teeth. The last 4 teeth, called "wisdom teeth" or "third molars" come in by age 17-21 in most people. Some people never grow wisdom teeth. Or they may have only 2 instead of 4.
Tooth structure.
The outside white part of teeth is called the "enamel". The enamel is made of calcium and phosphate. Under the enamel is the "dentin". The dentin is softer than the hard enamel. So it is hurt more by dental decay (cavities.) Under the dentin is the "pulp" which has the nerves and blood vessels that go to the tooth. This is the part that causes the pain of a toothache. "Cementum" is outside the dentin where there is no enamel. Cementum holds the tooth to the bone of the jaw.
Healthy teeth.
If they are protected and kept clean, teeth should stay for a person's whole life. Many people lose their teeth early because they do not do the right things to keep teeth healthy.
Disease of teeth.
Plaque is the soft white substance that forms on teeth when they are not cleaned. It has bacteria in it that hurt enamel. If plaque is not cleaned off, after 2 days it can become tartar. Tartar is a hard substance that forms on teeth (mostly near the gums). Tartar makes gums unhealthy and makes more bacteria grow on the teeth.
Plaque is cleaned off with a toothbrush. If tartar forms on teeth, a dentist must clean it off.
The bacteria that are on teeth eat into the enamel. Cleaning teeth, flossing teeth, eating good foods, and having a dentist take off plaque make less bacteria on teeth. If there is too much bacteria, they eat enamel faster than teeth make enamel. This makes holes in enamel called cavities. When a person gets cavities, he has the disease dental caries. Making cavities in enamel happens slowly. But once cavities go through enamel, the soft dentin is hurt much faster. If the cavity is not fixed by a dentist, it can go into the root. This permanently hurts the tooth. Once this happens the tooth must be taken out or the dentist must do a root canal (a surgery to replace the root with a chemical substance to keep the tooth in place, at times dangerous.) If the tooth is not fixed with a root canal or is not taken out, a tooth infection can happen. This infection can spread onto the face. It can even kill the person if not helped by a dentist or doctor.
