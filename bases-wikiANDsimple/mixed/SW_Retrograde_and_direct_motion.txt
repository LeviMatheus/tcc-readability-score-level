Direct motion is the motion of a planetary body in a direction similar to that of other bodies within its system, and is sometimes called prograde motion. Retrograde motion is motion in the opposite direction. In the case of celestial bodies, such motion may be real, defined by the natural rotation or orbit of the body, as seen in the skies from Earth.
