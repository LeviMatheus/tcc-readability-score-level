Silent barter is what is done when traders who cannot speak each other's language can trade without talking. This was used in many parts of ancient Africa. Silent bartering was mainly used during 500 A.D to 1500 A.D.
To do a silent barter, one group of traders would go to a certain location, leaving whatever they are offering to trade. The other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods (usually salt or gold) that were left. If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and leave because the person accepted the offer. This system of trading was used mostly in Ancient Ghana.
