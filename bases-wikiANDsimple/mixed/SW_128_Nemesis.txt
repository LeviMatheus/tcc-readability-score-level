128 Nemesis is a very big and very dark main belt asteroid made of carbonate. It rotates rather slowly, taking about one and half Earth days to finish one rotation. Nemesis is the biggest member of the Nemesian asteroid family having its name. It was found by J. C. Watson on November 25, 1872 and named after Nemesis, the goddess of retribution in Greek mythology. Nemesis is also the name of a hypothetical companion star of the sun.
