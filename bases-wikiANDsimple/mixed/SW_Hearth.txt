A hearth (har-th) is a brick or stone lined fireplace or oven that is used for cooking and heating. Historically, the hearth was the center of the home, as it provided heat for the house. Its Latin name is "focus" as it could be called the "focus" of the house.
In more modern times, the hearth can also be section of the fireplace that can be seen. This often includes tileing around the base of the fireplade onto the floor.
