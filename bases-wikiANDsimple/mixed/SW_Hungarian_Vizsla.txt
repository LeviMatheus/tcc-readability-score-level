Hungarian Vizlas are a type of dog, known for being affectionate and not aggressive. They originated in Hungary and are excellent hunting dogs.
History.
The breed was developed from dogs used by Magyar tribes. Vizslas were owned by sporting nobility of Hungary who used them to hunt with. They were also used to hunt deer, wild boar and wolf. The breed was almost wiped out during the First World War and again in the Second. Dogs were smuggled out of Hungary during the second war and used to breed in other countries.
Appearence and personality.
Hungarian Vizsla's are russet gold. Some dogs may also have small white marks on their feet and/or chest.
They are active, enthusiastic, friendly. Vizslas need human interaction to stay happy and therefore do not make good kennel dogs.
Exercise needs.
Daily exercise and mental stimulation are needed. Indoors, Vizslas can be quite inactive, preferring to rest beside their owners, whilst others can be quite demanding of attention. Outside they are very active. If Vizslas do not receive sufficient mental and physical exercise, they will become bored, and what they choose to do to amuse themselves will usually be seen by you as destructive - such as digging or chewing.
