Blood Red Shoes are an indie music band from Brighton, England. Blood Red Shoes's first album was "Box of Secrets". There are two members: Laura-Mary Carter and Steven Ansell. They are often compared to "The White Stripes" due to the boy-girl drum-guitar setup, but they dislike this comparison and, indeed, the White Stripes themselves. Laura-Mary plays guitar while Steven plays drums.
