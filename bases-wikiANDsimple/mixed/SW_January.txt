January is the first month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars. It has 31 days.
January is named for Janus, the Roman god of doors and gateways.
January and February were put on the calendar after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar, Winter did not have months. Although March was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new consuls (Roman leaders).
January's flower is the Carnation with its birthstone being the Garnet. The meaning of the Garnet is Constancy.
The first day of January is called New Year's Day. In some countries it has the name of the Saint Sylvester.
