Modes in music are a kind of scale.
The Ancient Greeks used several modes in their music. Medieval musicians borrowed the names of these modes to describe the scales used in their music. Today we usually use two modes: major and minor. A mode can start on any note.
Each mode has a different pattern of tones and semitones (or “half tones”) (see semitone).
tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone.
tone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.
The modes are easiest to see on a piano keyboard using the white notes only.
Each mode also has a version called “hypo—“.
For example: A to A is Hypodorian. It is the same as Aeolian, but the D is treated as the final note (we would say the “keynote”).
The names of the modes come from cities in Ancient Greece.
In the Middle Ages these modes were widely used in church music.
Some composers in recent centuries have enjoyed using the ancient modes from time to time in their music. Folksongs are often modal. Greensleeves is an example of a well-known tune which is modal.
