Inuvik is a town in the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is also where the local government of the Inuvik Region is based.
History.
Inuvik was created as a replacement in 1953 for the earlier administrative center, Aklavik because that area was often flooded. At first, it was called "New Aklavik" but was renamed Inuvik in 1958 because there was confusion between the names of Aklavik and New Akalavik. Inuvik means "Place of Man" in Inuvialuktun, the local Inuit language.
