Pakistan shares a long land border with Afghanistan (also called the Durand Line). The border is poorly marked and it is easily crossed by people.
Pashtun peoples live on both sides of the international border.
In June 2008 relations between the two countries worsened due to disagreements over fighting militants. Afghan President Hamid Karzai threatened to send troops over the border to fight militants. Pakistan then issued a warning to Afghanistan that it would not "tolerate any violations of its borders". Many Taliban now come from Pakistan and many sources state Osama bin Laden may also be in Pakistan, making relations worse because of the Afghan and coalition hunt to find him.
