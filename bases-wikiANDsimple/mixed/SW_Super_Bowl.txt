The Super Bowl is a special football game played every year at the end of the NFL season. The best team from each of the two NFL conferences play for the Vince Lombardi Trophy, which was named after the first coach to win a Super Bowl. For most football fans, it is a very special event. People who do not like football still watch it for the commercials and the half-time show. The San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys and the Pittsburgh Steelers currently are tied for most Super Bowl wins with 5. The teams Arizona Cardinals, Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and New Orleans Saints have not appeared in a Super Bowl ever. The Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets have not appeared in the Super Bowl since the merger in 1970.
