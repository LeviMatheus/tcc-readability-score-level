Democracy means ruled by all of the people. There are two types of democracy, direct and indirect. In a direct democracy there are no representatives. All decisions are made at the level of the people. When a budget or law needs to be passed, then the idea goes to the people. This obviously could get very complicated but if broken down into state levels of the same system it could be sorted out. There would be no political action groups because they would have to pay off the entire population of the country. Taxes could not be raised without the permission of the people. The few would no longer rule the many and the government would not cost billions of pounds just to operate. In indirect, or representative democracy, citizens elect representatives to make laws on their behalf. This is what most modern countries have today. Democracy is important because everyone gets a say in how the country should be run.
