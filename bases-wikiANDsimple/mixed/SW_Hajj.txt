The Hajj is the pilgrimage to Mecca, where the Kaaba is located.The Kaaba is a large, black cube situated in "The great mosque" in Mecca.
The pilgrimage is one of the five most important duties a Muslim must do. These duties are called the Five Pillars of Islam.
Muslims must make the Hajj at least once in a lifetime if they can afford it. Usually pilgrims go on a seven day roundtrip around the religious sites. The Kaaba is a holy place for Muslims and shows Muslims that each and every Muslim is equal in the eyes of God, and that he or she must be willing to give up anything are do anything for him. When on the pilgrimage special plain clothes should be worn.
The Hajj differs from an ordinary pilgrimage, Umrah, as it can only happen at a certain time of the year. The right time of the year is from the 8th to 12th day of Dhu al-Hijjah, the 12th month of the Islamic calendar. Because the Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, eleven days shorter than the Gregorian calendar used in the Western world, the Gregorian date of the Hajj is eleven days earlier from year to year.
An ordinary or lesser pilgrimage, Umrah, can be performed at any time of the year. The rituals of Umrah are also performed for Hajj, but there are actions that are exclusive to Hajj.
The pilgrimage to Mecca is very popular as millions of Muslims visit the Islamic city each year!
