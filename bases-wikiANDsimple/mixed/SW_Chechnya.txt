Chechnya ("Noxçiyçö") is a federal subject of Russia, located in the Caucasus which several times tried to depart from Russia. The issue is still being disputed, mainly because many people, both Russian and Chechen (people from Chechnya), died during the conflict. People of Chechnya are Muslims and are derived from ancient Hurrians who spoke a Dene-Caucasian language. Most Chechens belong to Hanafi school of Sunni Islam.
In Alexander Litvinenko's opinion Vladimir Putin became president by lying and blaming bombs in Moscow on Chechen terrorists.
