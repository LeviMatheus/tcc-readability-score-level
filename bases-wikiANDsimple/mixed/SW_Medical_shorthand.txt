Medical shorthand (shorthand: a way of talking and writing quickly) is a shorthand used by medical professionals (people who work to help sick people) to hurry explanation of diseases (sickness), patients, or medicines (drugs).
This shorthand can include shortening (making less lengthy) of longer disease names, by cutting the word down to it's base (the Latin or Greek part that makes it). Medical professionals also create (make) words that mean something. An example of this is "stat", used to indicate (show) that something needs to be hurried (gone faster). It is from the latin "base word" statim, meaning quick. A very commonly (often) used shorthand is shortening things on order forms for patients. An example is, pre-op meaning pre-operation (patient who is being prepared for surgery). These can be very complicated and extensive (meaning there is a lot of them).
Despite the fact that this shorthand might make it difficult for new Interns (new Doctors) or recently trained Nurses to get used to this unofficial language, it has been shown to improve (make better) the speed of treatment in hospitals.
