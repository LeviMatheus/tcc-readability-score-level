Samara Morgan is a fictional character from the movie "The Ring". In "The Ring", she is played by Daviegh Chase, and in "The Ring Two", she is played by Kelly Stables.
Origin.
Her true origin is found out in "The Ring Two". Anna Morgan is not Samara's birth mother. Evelyn (just Evelyn) birthed her when she was 16. When Rachel visited her, she was 42. Samara told her is a baby to kill her. So Evelyn tried to kill her. But the FBI stopped her. Ever since, she's been mentalized in a hospital. So Samara had to be put up for adoption. That brings us to Anna Morgan (a woman seen in the cursed video). She and her husband tried to get pregnant, but they never could. So they adopted her. Samara still sent weird things to her mind. Both of them were mentalized.
So she got rid of her. She suffocated her with a trash bag. Then she hit her in the head with a rock. But it only made Samara weak. So she threw her into the well.
The tape.
Samara then made a tape. It started with a cabin being built over the well after she was killed. Once, a group of teenagers were staying there and made a tape of their adventures. But Samara took advantage of it. Instead, there is black, gore scary pictures. After it ends, the closest phone will ring. A voice comes on. It says "Seven days" before hanging up. Then a curse is cast. The viewer has a week to break the curse. The only way is to make a copy of the tape and showing it to someone else. That will keep the cycle going.
