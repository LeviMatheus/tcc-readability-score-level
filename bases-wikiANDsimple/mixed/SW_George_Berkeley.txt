George Berkeley () (12 March 1685 â€“ 14 January 1753), also known as Bishop Berkeley, was a philosopher. His main philosophical achievement was the advancement of a theory he called "immaterialism" (later referred to as "subjective idealism" by others). He said that we know the sensations and we can think of an object, but we can not be sure that this object actually exists.
