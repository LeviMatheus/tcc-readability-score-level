A chloroplast is a small structure inside the cells of a plant that absorbs light and allows it to do a process known as photosynthesis.
Chloroplasts contain the chemical chlorophyll, which is needed to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll is what gives green plants their green colour.
A chloroplast also contains carbon dioxide and water, which is needed for photosynthesis (with the help of chlorophyll). It produces sugar for the plant. From which glucose is formed.
