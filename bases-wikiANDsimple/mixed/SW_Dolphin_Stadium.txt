The building of the stadium.
Dolphin Stadium was the very first stadium that was built using money from private people. Joe Robbie was the person who gave a good part of the money needed to build the stadium.
Robbie made the stadium with a wider field so that soccer and baseball could be played in the stadium. The seats that are closest to the field are 90 feet from the sidelines on the football field. Baseball was played in Dolphin Stadium as planned, and this was good because it made use of the wider fields.
After Dolphin Stadium was completed, it was renamed after the person who designed the field, Joe Robbie. The first regular season NFL game that was played in Dolphin Stadium was a win against the Kansas City Chiefs.
