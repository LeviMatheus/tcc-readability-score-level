A military engineer prepares the technical conditions for warfare. That means he builds trenches and other helps for defence and builds and destroys roads and bridges. In some cases an engineer may have to destroy something that he has built before. In many armies the military engineers are also called pioneers or sappers.
In modern times a military engineer that operates during battle is called a combat engineer.
Origins of military engineering.
Perhaps the first people who had a special force of military engineering specialists were the Romans. Roman military engineering was very good in its time. So they were able to build a double-wall of fortifications that was 30 miles long in total (both walls together) in just six weeks, when they wanted to encircle a besieged city in Gaul.
The design, construction, and destroying of the works shown would be the task of a military engineer.
