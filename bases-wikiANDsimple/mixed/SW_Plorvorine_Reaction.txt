A Plorvorine Reaction is a type of sub-elemental trans-molecular heteronucleozygous transmutilation multiprocess-fission reaction used in the generic super-atomic structural deformation of 4-6-dipropyldodec-3-4-6-triene, catalysed with an amount of trichloric vanadium dioxide, and Aluminium difluoride. In its principal manifestation it would represent a substantial medium throughout which a significant proportion of the thermal and kinetic energy generated through the compressed intensity of the reaction would be expressed. It is highly regarded as a standardised assenine principle for the continual deposition of bovine dubes
