Jens Lehmann (born November 10 1969 in Essen, Germany) is a German footballer. He has played for Arsenal F.C. since 2003. Lehmann is the goalkeeper of the German national football team. He has played 60 matchs for the national team.
As an adult.
Jens Lehmann has played for Arsenal in 2002 in November. He has had lots of memories but now in 2007 he got injured and then got replaced by Manuel Almunia. He came back on December the 1st from his knee injury. Now Jens has played 1 or 2 games for Germany and now is probably going to quit Arsenal F.C. and he is thinking to go to a German team. And now Arsenal F.C. have to say another goodbye to their 3rd recent mover.
Jens has just began to play again after his bad injury (knee injury). He played at least a game for Germany on December the 6th 2007. Unfortunantly he let in 3 goals and saved 22 from going in to the goals. Jens now might live in Germany forever because he is leaving Arsenal F.C. and moves in July 2008 to VfB Stuttgart.
