A ribbon is a thin, flexible band, usually cloth but also plastic or sometimes metal.
Ribbons are mostly used for tying or decorating things. Ribbons can be used to tie a person's hair, decorate clothing or uniforms, or to tie up packages. A typewriter uses a cloth or plastic ribbon to hold the ink.
