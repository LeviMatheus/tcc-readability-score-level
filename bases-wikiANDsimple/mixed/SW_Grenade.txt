Hand-held grenades.
Hand-held grenades are grenades used by the infantry (soldiers). There are three main types: one which gives a big powerful blast to destroy bunkers, another which starts fires and another which contains shrapnel to hurt enemy soldiers.
A hand-held grenade is usually shaped like an egg, with a metal-arm on its top and a ring. When you pull out the ring, the arm flips up and ignites a fuse. The user then has a few seconds to throw it and take cover, usually about 5 seconds.
An early type of hand-held grenade was a iron-ball, filled with gunpowder and with a long fuse that its user must light up with a match before throwing. The German army used stick grenades (grenades with handles) during World War one and World War two.
Cannon-grenades.
The most commonly used grenade, and it comes in all sizes, from 50mm cannons against aircraft, to 105mm shots in tanks, to up to 50cm or more mounted on great battleships or coastal fortresses.
It works the same way as a gun, but instead of just a lead bullet, the shell is packed with explosives like TNT. An artillery-grenade can do a lot of damage when it explodes.
Airplane-ammo-grenades.
Airplane-ammo-grenades are used in machine-cannons mounted on either warplanes or gunships (helicopters built for war). It is the same shape as a ordinarey shot, but much bigger. It consist of a tube with an ignition mechanism in its rear, which throws out the shell very quickly. The shell is loaded with TNT or any other type of explosive.
