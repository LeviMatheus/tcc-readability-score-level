A comb is a tool. It has small pieces sticking out of a main frame; these are called "teeth." A comb is usually flat. It is used to care for hair or other fibers.
Humans have been using combs as a tool for a long time, at least for 5000 years. Combs are used by humans to separate tangled hairs, to keep hair clean and to style hair. They are also used for decorating hair.
