Moapa Valley is a 40-mile valley and region in the American State of Nevada. Within the valley are four towns: Overton, Logandale, Moapa, and Glendale, Nevada. Logandale and Overton are not far from each other, and thus it is hard to tell one from the other without a sign. Moapa Valley was formed by the Muddy River, which flows through that area. Moapa Valley also contained a large amount of archaeological sites, mostly created by the Anasazi Native Americans, which were largely damaged by construction.
Moapa Valley is also the location of the Lost City Museum, which is a museum displaying artifacts and reconstructed adobe pueblos built on the original sites of the pueblos.
