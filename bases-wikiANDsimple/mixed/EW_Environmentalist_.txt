An environmentalist is a person who is concerned with and/or advocates for the protection of the environment. An environmentalist can be considered a supporter of the goals of the environmental movement, "a political and ethical movement that seeks to improve and protect the quality of the natural environment through changes to environmentally harmful human activities". An environmentalist is engaged in or believes in the philosophy of environmentalism.
Environmentalists are sometimes referred to using informal or derogatory terms such as "greenie" and "tree-hugger".
Impact: The environmentalist movement has made America today a more ecologically friendly place than in the 1960s and 1970s when the movement started (Goldstein 2002).
