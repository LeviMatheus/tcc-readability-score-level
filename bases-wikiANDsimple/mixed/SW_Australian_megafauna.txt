Australian megafauna is a term used to describe a number of comparatively large animal species in Australia, that had a body mass that was about more than 30% greater that that of their closest living relatives. These species became extinct during the Pleistocene (16,100Â±100 - 50,000 years before present), but exact dates for their extinction have been lacking until recently.
