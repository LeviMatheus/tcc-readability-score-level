The A∴A∴ (Latin: "Argenteum Astrum" or Greek: "Άστρον Αργόν", "Astron Argon", both literally; "Silver star", alternately, Latin: "Arcanum Arcanorum", is a magical order created by Aleister Crowley in 1907 after leaving the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It is a Thelemic magical fraternity in which the holy book of the order is "The Book of the Law". Its motto is: "The method of science, the aim of religion." While the A∴A∴ was not part of Ordo Templi Orientis, the O.T.O. did consider the A∴A∴ to be a close ally.
Various lineages of the A∴A∴ survive today that can be traced back to the founders Aleister Crowley and George Cecil Jones.
