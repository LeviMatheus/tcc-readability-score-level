Hater was an American rock band from the 1990s, a side project mostly under the direction of Soundgarden bassist Ben Shepherd. Additional members included Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron, John McBain (ex-Monster Magnet and, later, partner of Cameron and Shepherd in Wellwater Conspiracy), bassist John Waterman for the title album, Alan Davis on bass for The 2nd, and Brian Wood, brother of Mother Love Bone vocalist Andrew Wood.
The band released two albums of their brand of Stooges-tinged psychedelic garage rock: their self-titled debut in 1993, and their follow-up, "The 2nd", which was recorded in 1995 but released in 2005.
The band also contributed a song for the 1995 compilation album ' called "Convicted", which does not appear on either album. The musicians for the track were Shepherd, McBain, Davis, & Cameron (the same lineup for "The 2nd").
