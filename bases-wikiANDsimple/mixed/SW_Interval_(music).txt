An interval in music means the distance between two notes (whether these notes are played together or separately).
Two notes on a keyboard which are next to one another (counting both white and black notes) are a “semitone” apart. A “tone” is two semitones (see semitone). However, an “interval” depends on how the notes are written (what they are called) e.g. whether the black note between D and E is written as D sharp or E flat (which are two different names for the same note).
C D E F G A B C and down again.
(this is always so long as the letter name has not changed).
It is important to realize that, in order to work out what an interval is, the lower note should be treated as the first note of the scale.
Intervals can be “inverted” (turned upside down). For example: instead of going from a C up to an A (major 6th) we can go from C down to an A (minor 3rd).
Compound intervals are intervals bigger than an octave e.g.
C to D an octave and one more note above it is a major 9th.
Big intervals are called “wide” intervals. The opposite is a “narrow” interval.
