I (И, и) is the ninth letter in the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [i].
It looks like a backwards N. The lowercase и's italic looks like a "и". Its old name was "izhe".
It came from the Greek eta and stands for the Roman I.
There is another letter, the decimal I ("І", "і"), that sounds the same as И. Russian, Macedonian, Serbian and Bulgarian languages use only И; and Church Slavonic and Ukrainian uses both И and і. To tell the letters apart, И is sometimes called "octal I" because was eighth in the Cyrillic numeral system.
