Lego, also called LEGO, is a type of toy created and made by the Lego Group, a company in Denmark. The company was made by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The company's toy, "Lego bricks", have a lot of colorful building blocks that can be joined together easily, and also together with a whole set of gears, small fake people and other parts. There are also many other types of simple parts such as wheels, car screens, and plants. Lego bricks can be joined together in many ways, to make things like vehicles, buildings and even robots that can actually move. You can take the blocks out from anything you make, and use them again to make other things. When you buy a set, it will have all the pieces you need to build a type of thing. The blocks are joined together by some buttons on the top and joined using places where the buttons can go into at the bottom. The toys were originally created in the 1940s in Europe and now almost everyone in the world knows about it and likes it. Almost all the blocks from Lego sets can fit together. New blocks made in 2008 can fit with old blocks as old as 1963, and blocks made for older children can join with blocks for children. The blocks can join together no matter which set they come from. Lego blocks are made from plastic. Now, Lego can work with machines, and you can use Lego to make robots. Lego has been so popular that people sometimes even use the word to talk about building blocks.
