The first dance school was opened in 1661 in Paris, France. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. Ballroom dances are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the waltz are done with two people.
People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. Dance schools teach dance movements. It takes many years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer.
Dance can be used as a form of communication between humans or humans and animals, it is a way of becoming an object or it is musical, mythological or a funny piece of work. Classical ballet (say 'bal-ay'), tap, folk, dance gymnastics, figure skating and synchronised swimming are types of dance. 'Swan Lake' has been shown to the public using ballet.
