A peptic ulcer is an ulcer of the stomach or duodenum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestines. It is the tube that food goes through when it leaves the stomach. "Peptic" means talking about the stomach.
Gastric ulcers are peptic ulcers in the stomach.
Duodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers in the duodenum.
Causes of peptic ulcers.
Most ulcers are caused by an infection from bacteria. This bacteria is called "Helicobacter pylori". 90% of gastric ulcers and 75% of duodenal ulcers are from "Helicobacter pylori" infection.
Symptoms of peptic ulcers.
A symptom is a change in the body that tells someone that they have a disease. The biggest symptom is pain in the stomach. Pain is usually in the top of the abdomen below the ribs. Some people also feel pain go up to the chest.
Diagnosis of peptic ulcers.
The best way is "endoscopy". But this costs more money. Endoscopy is done by a medical specialist called a "gastroenterologist" (a doctor who knows much about the digestive system.)
A good thing about endoscopy is finding other diseases if there is no peptic ulcer. The symptoms of peptic ulcer can be from other diseases. Endoscopy can diagnose these other diseases.
Treatment of peptic ulcers.
The most important treatment is to stop the "Helicobacter pylori" infection. This is done with antibiotics. Antibiotics are medicines that kill germs like bacteria. More than one antibiotic is used.
Both of these medicines make the cells in the stomach stop making acid.
To stop peptic ulcers people must use antacids "and" antibiotics. The antibiotics kill the "Helicobacter pylori". The antacids let the stomach heal.
Once the medicines are done, the ulcer should be gone. It can come back. It comes back if the person gets "Helicobacter pylori" again.
