Investment or investing means that an asset is bought, or that money is put into a bank to get a future interest from it.
Literally, the word means the "action of putting something in to somewhere else" (perhaps originally related to a person's garment or 'vestment').
Types of investment.
The major difference in the use of the term investment between the economics field and the finance field is that economists refer to a real investment (such as a machine or a house), while financial economists refer to a financial asset, such as money that is put into a bank or the market, which may then be used to buy a real asset. An important thing to know about investing is that even when the times are tough that is the time when you most need to hold on to your investment.
Business Management.
The investment decision (also known as "capital budgeting") is one of the fundamental decisions of business management.
