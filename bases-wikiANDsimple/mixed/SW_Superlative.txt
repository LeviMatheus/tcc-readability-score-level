In English, most superlatives can be formed by adding -EST to an existing adjective, like fluffiest, craziest or coldest. Some adjectives have irregular superlative forms, such as far ("farthest"). Still more adjectives have no superlative form, and the superlative is made simply by adding the adverb "most" before the adjective. For instance, one does not say "funnest," or "interestingest," but rather "most fun," and "most interesting." This is known as a superlative construction. Superlative constructions are used for almost all adjectives ending in "ing" (interesting, fascinating, disgusting,appealing etc).
