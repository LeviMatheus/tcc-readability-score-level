144 Vibilia is a dark, big Main belt asteroid and probably primitive in composition (what it is made of).
It is the only big member of the Vibilia asteroid family.
It was found by C. H. F. Peters on June 3, 1875 in Clinton, New York and named after Vibilia, a Roman goddess.
Vibilia has been seen to occult a star twice so far (in 1993 and again in 2001).
