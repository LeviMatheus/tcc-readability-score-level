North West Cape is a large piece of land on the north west coast of Western Australia. There are mountains called the Cape Range through the middle of the peninsula and Ningaloo Reef is on the western edge. The town of Exmouth is also on the North West Cape.
In 1618, Dutch East India Company captain Lenaert Jacobszoon and Willem Janszoon of the boat called the "Mauritius" landed in the area. Phillip Parker King visited in 1818 and named it "North West Cape" as well as naming Exmouth Gulf after a Royal Navy officer, Edward Pellew, First Viscount Exmouth (1758 -1833).
Later, pearl boats visited the area from Broome.
