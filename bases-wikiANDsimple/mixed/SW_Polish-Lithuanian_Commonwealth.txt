The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a federation of two countries of the 16th century. In 1569, Jagiellon Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania formed this federation. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth covered more lands than the present lands of Poland and Lithuania. The lands of the Commonwealth also covered all the lands of present day Belarus; a large part of Ukraine and Latvia; and western part of present day Russia. This Commonwealth lasted for more than 200 years. It ended with the final Partitions of Poland in 1795. The Commonwealth was an extension of the Polish-Lithuanian Union, a personal union between those two states that had existed from 1386.
