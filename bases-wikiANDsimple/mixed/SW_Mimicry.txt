Mimicry happens when a group of organisms, called the "mimics", have evolved to share common perceived characteristics with another group, called the "models", through the selective action of a "signal-receiver" or "dupe".
Camouflage, in which a species appears similar to its surroundings is a form of visual mimicry.
