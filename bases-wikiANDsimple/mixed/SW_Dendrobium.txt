Dendrobium is one of the largest families of orchids with somewhere around 1000 species being known. Being such a large family creates much diversity. Dendrobiums are found only in the Eastern Hemisphere and range from Australia, throughout the South Pacific and Philippines, Southeast Asia, and India, and a small representation in Japan.
