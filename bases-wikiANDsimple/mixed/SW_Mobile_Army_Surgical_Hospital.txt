A Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (or M.A.S.H. or MASH) was a medical center used during wars, to care and fix injured soliders who got hurt in the fighting. They were an alternative to field hospitals and real hospitals which were used in World War II. During the Korean War, thanks to these kinds of hospitals, soldiers had a 97% chance of surviving an injury. They were also used in the Vietnam War and the first Gulf War, but were gradually replaced by Combat Support Hospitals or CSHs which are used today.
Many people know about these places due to a well-known movie and later TV show called "M*A*S*H", which was set was a hospital like this during the Korean War.
