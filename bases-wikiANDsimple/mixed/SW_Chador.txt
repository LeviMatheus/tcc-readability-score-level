A chador (Persian چادر) is a piece of clothing. It is for muslim women. In Iran, women wear chador in public. Chador covers all the body except the face. However some religious women, cover their faces with their chador too.
A chador is a full-length semi-circle of fabric open down the front. It is thrown over the head and held shut in front. A chador has no hand openings or closures but is held shut by the hands or by wrapping the ends around the waist.
