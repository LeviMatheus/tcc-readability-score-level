Boxer is a character from the book Animal Farm by George Orwell. He is a horse, and is nearly eighteen hands high. In the book he is as strong as 2 horses put together. He has a white stripe down his nose, and that gives him a strange appearance. But still he was respected for his great power in work and his good character. He works as a cart-horse, as does Clover. Benjamin likes him in secret. Through the book he falls into the quarry when he was pulling a cart full of rock and is sent the a vetrinarian on an other farm by Napolean. Squealer then claims he died peacefully, but as benjamin can read he realises hes actually gone to the knackers.
