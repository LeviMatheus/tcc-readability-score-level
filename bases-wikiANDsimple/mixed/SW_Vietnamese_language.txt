Vietnamese (tiếng Việt) is the official language of Vietnam. It has been strongly influenced by Chinese, particularly Cantonese. Vietnamese is also slightly similar to Khmer. Today it uses Quốc Ngữ, a Latin alphabet similar to English, though it once used Chinese-based symbols called Chữ Nôm. Almost no people know Chữ Nôm today.
