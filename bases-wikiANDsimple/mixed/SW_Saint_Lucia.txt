Saint Lucia is a tropical island country in the eastern Caribbean Sea. It is a part of the Lesser Antilles, and it is north of the islands of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and south of Martinique.
The island of Saint Lucia has more mountains than many other Caribbean islands, with the highest one being Mount Gimie, at above the sea. Two other mountains, the Pitons, are the island's most famous landmark. They are located near Soufrière, on the west side of the island. Saint Lucia is also one of the few islands in the world that has a volcano that people can drive into.
The capital city of Saint Lucia is Castries, where about one third of the population lives. Major towns include Gros Islet, Soufrière and Vieux Fort. The local climate is tropical, with a dry season from January to April and a rainy season from May to November.
