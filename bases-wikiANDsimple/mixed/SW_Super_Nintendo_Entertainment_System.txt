The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (often shortened to "SNES" or "Super NES") is a 16-bit video game console created by Nintendo. It was called the Super Famicom in Japan, and the Super Comboy in South Korea. The console can display 2D graphics. Super NES games are loaded from a cartridge. Sony asked Nintendo to create a peripheral CD-ROM reader for the Super NES, but the project, named "Play station", was abandoned and Sony decided to create their own video game console, and they named it the PlayStation.
