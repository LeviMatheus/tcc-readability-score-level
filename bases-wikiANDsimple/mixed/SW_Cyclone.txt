Cyclone in meteorology refers to any low pressure area with winds spiraling inwards. Cyclone rotate clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Northern Hemisphere. Cyclone is the general term for a variety of low pressure system types, such as tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones and tornadoes.
Cyclones occur commonly on Earth, but other planets have cyclones too. The most famous is Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Mars is also known to have cyclones.
It is very common to have a few objects flying around such as cows and frogs as well as rain. This is often the cause of unusual raining objects.
Cyclones are also called hurricanes and typhoons. They consist of the eye, eyewall and rainbands.
