The Zanskar Range is spread over a vast area from south eastern boundaries of the state of Kashmir and extends in the north west direction to the eastern limits of Baltistan. It separates Ladakh from the valleys of Kashmir and the Chenab River.
In other words it serves as a boundary line between Ladakh region of Occupied Kashmir and the remaining two regions of the state i.e. Jammu region and Vale of Kashmir. 23000 feet high peak Nunkun is situated within this range. Marbal Pass and many other passes which connect Ladakh with Kashmir are situated in this area, 13000 feet high Zojila Pass is situated in the extreme north west of Zanskar range. This range, in fact is a branch of the great Himalayan range of mountains. Many rivers taking birth in different branches of this range flow northward, and join the great Indus River. These rivers include Hanle River, Khurna River, Zanskar River, Suru River (Indus), and Shingo River.
