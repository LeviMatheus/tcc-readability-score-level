In chemistry and physics an atomic theory explains what the basic structure of matter is like. It says that all of matter is made up of tiny parts called atoms, and attempts to explain what atoms are like. Atomic theory has changed over time, but one of the earliest known atomic theories was explained by the Greek philosopher Democritus. A lot of the ideas in the modern theory came from John Dalton, a British chemist and physicist.
The theory applies to solids, liquids and gases, but it does not apply to plasmas or neutron stars, where temperature and density stop atoms from forming.
