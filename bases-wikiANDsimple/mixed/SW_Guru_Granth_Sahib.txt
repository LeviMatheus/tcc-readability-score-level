The Guru Granth Sahib is the name of a book of religion of Sikhs. The name of the book is made up of three words. The first word is Guru, and a Guru in Sanskrit language means a teacher. Granth is a word of Hindi, and this means a book. The third word Sahib is a word of Urdu language and it means master. Thus, the Guru Granth Sahib means "a Master Book by the Teacher". Guru Nanak, the first Guru of Sikhs, wrote the book, and so the book is called Guru Granth Sahib, that is the book by the teacher.
The book contains prayers, hymns and songs of Sikh religion.
