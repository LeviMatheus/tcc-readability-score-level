Uranos is the god of the sky in Greek mythology. He and Gaia, the earth Goddess, had many children. His children were called the Titans. He eventually began to have deformed children, which he decided to bury in the earth. These titans united under one leader, Cronos, and rose from the Earth to overthrow Uranos.
