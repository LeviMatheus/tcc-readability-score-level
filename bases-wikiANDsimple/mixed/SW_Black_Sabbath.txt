History.
Black Sabbath formed in 1968 and were originally called Earth and they played Hard Rock. They changed their sound after Tony Iommi thought that because people paid to watch horror films, they might want to hear scary music. So they began to write dark, scary and loud music with lyrics relating to Satan and death. They released their first album Black Sabbath on Friday February 1970. This was done on purpose as Friday 13th is considered an unlucky day by many people. Their first successful single came off the album, Paranoid that was released in 1970. The album had a song called 'War Pigs' which was against the Vietnam War. The band recored many other albums in the 70's and but they were troubled by drug addcition and drank a lot of alcohol. In 1979 singer Ozzy Osbourne was getting so drunk all the time the rest of the band fired him. They hired American singer Ronnie James Dio to replace him.
The band then recorded an album with him, Heaven and Hell. It was released in 1980. It was quite successful and helped to bring back some of their past glory. At this time, their drummer left and they hired a new one. After only two albums though Dio was fired. The guitarist, Tony Iommi, accused him of changing their recordings. After they fired Dio they had many different singers, drummers and guitarists. In 1991 Ronnie James Dio rejoined the band again but only for one year. In 1997 the original line up reformed and are now doing shows alll over the world again.
