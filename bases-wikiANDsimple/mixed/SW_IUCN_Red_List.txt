The IUCN Red List (also IUCN Red List of Threatened Species) is a list of species. The list tells for each species how likely it is to become extinct (or if it is already). This is called its conservation status. This list is complied each year by the World Conservation Union.
There are exact criteria to see if a certain species is threatened to become extinct. These criteria are the same for all regions of the world. The aim of the list is to tell people how threatened a certain species is. Politicians can then decide on the priorities and the efforts needed to save certain species from becoming extinct.
