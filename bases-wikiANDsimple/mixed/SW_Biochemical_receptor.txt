In biochemistry, receptors are special structures that can be found in cells. Receptors bind to specialised molecules. If the receptor has such a molecule, it is activated, else it is deactivated. Depending on its state, a change inside the cell may be triggered.
In short, receptors work like locks and keys. With the key, the lock can be locked or unlocked. If it is unlocked, the door belonging to it can be opened.
