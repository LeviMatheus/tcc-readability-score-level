"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is the seventh and last book in J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. The book was released worldwide on July 21, 2007 to an excited crowd. It became the fastest-selling book ever, with 8.3 million copies sold in the U.S. during the first 24 hours.
The film will be released in 2010, but on March 8, 2008, it was anounced that the film will be split into two parts; part one is due on November 19, 2010 and part two is due on May, 2011.
Throughout the books, Joanne Rowling has introduced a lot of different ideas and a great number of characters. While the stories are set in a magical world with sets of magical rules, the basic idea or philosophy of the story is about how real people behave toward each other. In the seventh book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", the author draws all the ideas and people together.
