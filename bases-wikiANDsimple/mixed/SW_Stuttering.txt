Stuttering or Stammering is a problem some people have when they speak. People who have it involutarlily repeat certain parts of words, or they prolong certain parts. Most often, stuttering is not a problem of producing speech (physically). It is also not linked to intelligence. It is usually a disorder linked to the development of children.
There are certain drugs that can treat it, but most often, a therapy is done. This therapy aims at changing the speech pattern by different means.
