An heir is a person who has inherited something after the original owner's death. Usually a child after their parents' death.
"Heir Apparent" and "Heir Presumptive" usually refer to someone who will inherit a royal or noble title.
An heir apparent is someone who will inherit after the death of the present title holder.
An heir presumptive is someone who might inherit, unless someone with a better claim under the rules of succession is born.
