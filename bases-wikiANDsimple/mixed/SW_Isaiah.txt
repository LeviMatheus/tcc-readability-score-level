Isaiah is a prophet of God, who prophesied from about 740-681 B.C. The name Isaiah means "the Lord saves". Isaiah is also the name of a book in the Old Testament, which tells the story of Israel in his time. Jesus was born hundreds of years later in 4 B.C, but still Isaiah predicted in this book, his birth and then death.
Assyria destroyed Israel at around 722 B.C and attacked Judah around 701 B.C.
