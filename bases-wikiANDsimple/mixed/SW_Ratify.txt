To ratify ("Ratification") is to adopt (accept and put in force) an important document or treaty that affects an entire country. For example, if a country decided to begin putting something like the Kyoto Protocol into force, then they have just ratified it. To have something ratified, it must usually be agreed to be good and must go through a process.
