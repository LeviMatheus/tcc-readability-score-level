Water buffalos are a kind of bovine. There are Wild Asian Water Buffalos and domestic buffalos or domestic Asian water buffalo. They occur (or rather, are bred) in Asia, South America and Southern Europe. They were bred from the Wild Asian Water Buffalo, which is now an endangered species.
Today, these buffalos are used for their milk, which has more fat than that of cows. The milk is processed to make Mozzarella, and curd. Feral populations are sometimes used to manage uncontrolled growth of vegetation around wetlands, they will simply graze it off. This keeps such bodies of water usable by birds and other wildlife.
