The home page of a web site is the document that a web server sends to another computer's web browser application when it has been contacted without a request for specific information. That is, when you enter only a domain name in the Address box without specifying a directory or a file, the "home page" is usually the first part of the web site you will be taken to. The Home Page is also called the Main Page.
A properly written home page will tell a user about the information available in the web site, and how to view different parts of the web site.
The home page of "simple.wikipedia.org" can be found at this link.
Home Page was a popular computer application used for composing web pages.
