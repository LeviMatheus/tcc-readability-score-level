There are four overseas regions of France. In the French language these are known as "départements d’outre-mer" or "DOM".
These four overseas regions have the same status as the metropolitan ones, those in the part of the country that is within Europe. They are like the overseas American states of Alaska and Hawaii.
Each of these regions returns elected representatives to the Senate and National Assembly in Paris, as well as to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The overseas regions of France together with the French overseas collectivities, elect three members to the European Parliament.
Since 1974, these regions have had their own individual Regional Councils for local government.
