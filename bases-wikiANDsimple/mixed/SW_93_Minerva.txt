93 Minerva is a big main belt asteroid. It is a C-type asteroid, meaning that it has a dark surface and probably made of carbonate. It was found by J. C. Watson on August 24, 1867 and named after Minerva, the Roman equivalent of Athena, goddess of wisdom,truth,war and the loom. An occultation of a star by Minerva was seen in France, Spain and the United States on November 22, 1982. An occultation diameter of ~170 km was measured from the observations. Since then two more occultations have been seen, which give an estimated mean diameter of ~150 km for diameter.
