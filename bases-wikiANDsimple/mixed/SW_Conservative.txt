Conservative is a word that means "does not like change". In politics, it can mean any political party or philosophy that is against big changes to the way society has always been. It also means wanting to save (or "conserve") resources (such as money, etc.) wherever possible, rather than spend them. These parties are usually set against "liberal" parties, which have the opposite philosophy. In the United States the Republican Party is considered the conservative party.
