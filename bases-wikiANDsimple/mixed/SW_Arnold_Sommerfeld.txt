Arnold Johannes Wilhelm Sommerfeld (* December 5th 1868 in Königsberg, East Prussia; † April 26th 1951 in Munich) was a German mathematician and theoretical physicist.
Sommerfeld was the son of a practical physician. After finishing school in 1886, he started studying mathematics at the University of Königsberg.
In 1891 he wrote his doctorate thesis about arbitrary functions in mathematical physics.
Afterwards he had to do his army serve.
Then he went to Göttingen. He became assistant at the institute for mineralogy, but was still interested in mathematical physics.
In 1894 he became assistant of Felix Klein. The year after he wrote his habilitation about the mathematical theory of optical diffraction and became docent for mathematics in Göttingen.
In the same year he became ordinary professor for mathematics at the mining college of Clausthal. Three years later he got a professorship at the Technical University of Aachen.
In 1906 he became professor for theoretical physics in Munich, were he stood for his lifetime.
While he was professor in Munich, he travelled two times around the world - in 1922/23 he was guest professor in Wisconsin and travelled afterwards through India, China and Japan, in 1928/29 he made a journey through the USA as teacher on universities.
In 1935 he went in pension, but he still worked until 1940.
There was a big trouble about the person, who should fellow him. Sommerfeld wanted to have Werner Heisenberg on his seat, but in time of Nazi regime a person got the job, who taught the so called German Physics, which included a kind of mystics. Sommerfeld tried to prevent that.
Sommerfeld died in 1951 by an traffic accident.
