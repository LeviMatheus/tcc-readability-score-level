Music video.
The "Falls Apart" video starts off showing the band in a dark wood room, with lots of rope around them. The members only have enough room to play their instruments. Eventually a man and a woman are shown and they are being held together by ropes. The man walks over to the woman and puts his arm around her. After a while she gets up and starts walking away, but then the ropes come off around everyone (the band and the couple alike). Because of this all of the body parts of the couple lie on the floor. But the man's hand crawls to the woman's hand and they hold each other while the band ends the song.
