A body double is a person who works in the movie or television production industry. Body doubles are models that act in scenes that actors or actresses do not want to do. For example, love scenes or scenes of nudity, where a person's body is shown.
Body doubles are usually models that have developed very good bodies by exercising and by eating well. Often, movies or television shows that use body doubles do not admit that a body double model was used.
In the popular American movie "Pretty Woman", a body double model called Donna Scoggins filmed nude scenes that actress Julia Roberts did not want to do.
