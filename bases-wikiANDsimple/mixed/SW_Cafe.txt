A cafe is a type of restaurant. Cafes usually serve coffee and snacks. The term "cafe" comes from French, meaning coffee.
You can read the newspaper and magazines there or chat about the topics of the time. It is familiar as a place where information can be exchanged.
A cafe is called a coffeehouse, coffee shop in English, and a cafe (also spelled as café in French, Spanish, and Portuguese or caffè in Italian) shares some of the characteristics of a bar, and some of the characteristics of a restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. In some countries, cafes more closely resemble restaurants, offering a range of hot meals, and possibly being licensed to serve alcohol. British cafes however, do not sell alcohol.
In the Netherlands, cannabis-selling cafes face an uncertain future under a planned new law banning smoking in public places. The cafes, which attract millions of tourists each year, allow customers to buy marijuana over the counter and openly smoke it.
Now cafes were reintroduced in the 1990s with the Internet cafe. The spread of modern-style cafes to many places, urban and rural, went hand in hand with computers. Computers and Internet access in a contemporary-styled atmosphere help to create a youthful, modern, outside place, compared to the traditional bar, or old-fashioned diners that they replaced. In the mid 2000s, cafes commonly offer Internet access, just as they offer telephones and newspapers.
