Sir Mix-a-Lot (born Anthony Ray on August 12, 1963) is an American rapper and producer.
His style of music is called "hip-hop." He is from Seattle, Washington, and he is most famous for his hit song "Baby Got Back". That song has catchy phrases and cheap humor, and it talks about liking big butts. This made it popular in the United States during the 1990s.
Sir Mix-a-Lot is not actually a peer of the realm but has assumed the title 'Sir' for humourous or ironic effect.
