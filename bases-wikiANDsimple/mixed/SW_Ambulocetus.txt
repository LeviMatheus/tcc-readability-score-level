Ambulocetus ("walking whale") was an early cetacean that could walk as well as swim. It looked like a furry crocodile or a giant otter but was actually an early whale.
Ambulocetus had a long, low body with short, powerful limbs. It's back legs in seemed to be used for movement. Its feet had long, probably webbed toes. Each toe ended in a very small hooflet). It's tail was slightly flattened, like that of an otter, to help it swim. It's eyes and nostrils were on the top of its skull. This let it see and breathe while just under the surface of the water. It had a very dangerous set of teeth.
One mostly complete specimen and several partial skeletons have been found in Pakistan.
