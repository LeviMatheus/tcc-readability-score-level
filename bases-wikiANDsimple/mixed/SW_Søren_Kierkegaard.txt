Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (5 May, 1813 – 11 November, 1855), a 19th century Danish philosopher and theologian, is usually thought of as the first existentialist philosopher.
He wrote many philosophical books about faith, existence, emotions, and feelings. He disliked people who try to make Christianity political and people who try to limit the single individual in favour of many people. Many people have found his works intriguing and have acknowledged them as great works of philosophy. Ludwig Wittgenstein, a 20th century philosopher, thought Kierkegaard was "by far, the most profound thinker of the nineteenth century" (,).
He was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He attended Copenhagen University and earned his master's degree in 1841. During this time, he met and fell in love with Regine Olsen in 1837, a very important person to him. Although they were engaged for a time, Kierkegaard broke off the engagement, also in 1841.
After his breakup with Regine, he spent much of his time writing book after book, in a highly dramatic, yet subtle, way. Plus, he wrote and credited some of his works using pen names or pseudonyms. Although his works were not very popular during his lifetime, after his death, his works grew in popularity and became highly influential in the 20th and 21st centuries.
