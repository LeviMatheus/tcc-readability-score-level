An airport is a place where airplanes can land or takeoff. Most airports in the world have only a long strip of level ground called a runway. Many airports have buildings which are used to hold airplanes and passengers. A building that holds passengers waiting for their planes or luggage is called a terminal, and the sections between the plane and the terminal are called "gates". Airports also have buildings called hangars to hold planes when they are not used. Some airports have control buildings like towers to control where planes go. An international airport is a large airport that airplanes can use to fly to (and from) other countries. Most international airports have shops and restaurants.
An airport used by the military is often called an air force base or airbase. An aircraft carrier is a floating airbase.
Safety.
Today, many airports think that safety is very important. People must walk through a metal detector, a machine that can tell if metal goes through it. If it makes a noise, the officers will make that person take off all things on them that are metal. They also have X-Ray machines that can look into luggage. If officers find items such as weapons, guns, or anything that can be used to kill people, they have that item (and mostly the person who has it) taken away.
