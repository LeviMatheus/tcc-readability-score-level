Clay is a type of soil that is sticky to touch. It is often used in the making of gardening pots.Depending on the type, it sometimes has a gritty texture, and is sometimes very smelly.Clays are also complex materials containing many different types of atoms, however, all clays contain large numbers of silicon(Si) and Oxygen(O) atoms, joined together to form silicate. They form when rocks are broken down or weathered. To make pottery, we clay (a plastic material) is moulded in shape, allowed to dry and then fired in a furnace or kiln.
