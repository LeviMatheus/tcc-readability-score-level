Gerard Arthur Way is an American singer. He was born April 9, 1977 in Newark, New Jersey. Way is the lead singer and co-founder of the rock band My Chemical Romance. His brother Mikey is the bass player for the band. Gerard was first in a band when he was eleven. Way used to have long black hair but cut it off and dyed it blonde to better understand the idea behind their new album, "The Black Parade". Now his hair is black again and a bit longer, because he said it was annoying to try and keep it the same. Gerard married Lyn Z of Mindless Self Indulgence on September 3rd 2007. He recently said that he will be expecting his first child, with his wife Lyn-Z, in the summer of 2009.
Before My Chemical Romance.
Way attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City and graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1999. As a child, Way grew up in a dangerous neighborhood where crimes happened often. He said that he was not allowed to play outside much when he was younger. In place of that, he had to stay indoors. While not being able to play in the park, he created his own imaginary world in his head. This led to his love for artwork. Gerard hoped to one day be a comic book artist. Before the 11, Way was working on his cartoon "The Breakfast Monkey". He wanted it to be shown on Cartoon Network. The cartoon was rejected because it was very similar to the series "Aqua Teen Hunger Force".
