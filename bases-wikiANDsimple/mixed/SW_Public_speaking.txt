Public speaking is speaking to a group of people in an organized way with the hope to give information to, influence, or entertain the listeners. The art and science of public speaking, especially in a North American competitive environment, is also known as forensics'".
In public speaking there are five important parts which are often expressed as "who" is saying "what" to "whom" using what "medium" with what "effects"?" The purpose of public speaking can range from simply giving information, to getting to act, to simply telling a story. Good speakers are often able to change the way the listeners feel, and not just give them information. Public speaking can be a powerful tool to use for goals such as motivation, influence, persuasion, informing, translation, or simply entertaining.
