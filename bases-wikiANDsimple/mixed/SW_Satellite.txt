A satellite is any object that orbits another object in space. Satellites can be artificial, or they can be natural. The moon is a natural satellite. Uses of man-made satellites include machines that relay television signals, take photographs, send telephone traffic, help with weather forecasting, space investigation, and pollution control. The first man-made satellite was Sputnik.
