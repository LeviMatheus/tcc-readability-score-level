Jellyfish are water-living animals.
Their bodies consist of 99% water and they have no bones or inner organs. A jellyfish has a bell-shaped body and long tentacles at the underside of the body. (Tentacles are long "arms" with special stinging cells.) They move by contracting moves of their bell, but they cannot decide where to go on their own. Most time they drift with the water current.
This is why they assemble in swarms. They reproduce without mating by creating polyps, which do not look like jellyfish and are fixed to the ground.
When they turn to 10-15 small jellyfish, they die.
Jellyfish eat plankton and little fish, which are caught by their poisoned tentacles.
Some jellyfish live in symbiosis with algae. The jellyfish transport them into sunlight and get the nutrients (of their photosynthesis) from them. The largest species is the Portuguese Man o' War.
