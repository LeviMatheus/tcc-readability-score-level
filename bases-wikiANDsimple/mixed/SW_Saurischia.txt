Saurischia is one of the two orders/branches of dinosaurs. The name comes from the Greek "sauros" meaning 'lizard' and "ischion" meaning 'hip joint'. In 1888, Harry Seeley classified dinosaurs into two main orders. Their hip structure was how they were separated into these orders. Saurischians ('lizard-hipped') and the ornithischians ('bird-hipped') have differences in the ways bones in the hip are put together. All carnivorous dinosaurs (the theropods) are saurischians.
