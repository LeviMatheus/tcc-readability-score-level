Columbia University in the City of New York (commonly called Columbia University) is a research university in the United States. It is mainly located in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of the Borough of Manhattan, in New York City. It is one of the eight Ivy League universities.
The university was created as "King's College" by the Church of England. It got a royal charter in 1754 from King George II of Great Britain. It was the first college in New York, and the fifth college in the Thirteen Colonies. After the American Revolution it was run by the government from 1784-1787. In 1787, the university was placed under a private board of trustees. This board of trustees runs the university to this day.
Columbia is home to the Pulitzer Prize. For over a century, the Pulitzer has been given to people for very good work in journalism, literature and music. Columbia is where FM radio was created. The school is where the foundation of modern genetics was discovered. Its Morningside Heights campus was the first North American site where the uranium atom was split.
