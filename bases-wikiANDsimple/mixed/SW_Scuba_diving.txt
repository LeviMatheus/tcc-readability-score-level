Scuba Diving is a sport where people (called "scuba divers", or simply "divers") can swim underwater for a long time, using a tank filled with air. The tank is a large metal cylinder made of steel or aluminum. The divers have special equipment to control whether they float or sink. They also use a Regulator. A regulator is a piece of equipment which connects to the tank, and controls how much air is sent from the tank to the diver. It helps the diver to breathe in from the tank, and out to the water.
Divers also use other equipment. They wear a mask to see through, fins on their feet to swim better, and sometimes a wetsuit to keep them warm under water.
The word Scuba is an acronym from Self-Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus.
