Hunza River (Urdu:دریائے ہنزہ) is the main river in Hunza, in the Northern Areas of Pakistan. It is formed by the confluence of the Khunjerab River, Gujerab River, Misgar River, Chapursan River and Shimshal River. These rivers are fed by glaciers.
After flowing to south up to Nagar it turns to west. From Chalit it again takes a turn to the south. Flowing through Nomal Valley, it reaches Gilgit city and empties out into Gilgit River. It joins the Gilgit River with the Naltar River. Later it flows into the Indus River.
