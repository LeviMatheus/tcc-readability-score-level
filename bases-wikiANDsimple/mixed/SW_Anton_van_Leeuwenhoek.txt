Antony van Leeuwenhoek (October 24, 1632 - August 30, 1723), full name Thonius Philips van Leeuwenhoek (pronounced 'Laywenhook') was a Dutch tradesman and scientist from Delft, Netherlands. He is known as "the father of microbiology". He is best known for his work on the microscope. Using his handcrafted microscopes, he was the first to see and describe single celled organisms, which he originally referred to as "animalcules", and which we now refer to as micro-organisms. He was also the first to record microscopic observations of muscle fibers, bacteria, spermatozoa and blood flow in small blood vessels (capillaries).
