Iraqâ€“Pakistan relations are the relations between Pakistan and Iraq. In 2003, prior to the outbreak of the second Gulf War, the government of Pakistan announced it was opposed to any action against Iraq. Pakistan was under pressure by the public to vote against the war although some had been considering a vote for the war. After the war ended however Pakistan had indicated that it was willing to send troops to Iraq for peacekeeping.
