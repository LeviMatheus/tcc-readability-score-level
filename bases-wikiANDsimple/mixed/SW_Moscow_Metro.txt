The Moscow Metro is a metro system which reaches nearly every part of the city Moscow in Russia. It is one of the most heavily used metro systems in the world. It is also famous for its stations, which are heavily decorated.

In total the metro is 278.8 kilometres long and has 172 stations. During the week about 8.2 million passengers use the metro. On weekends there are 7.1 million passengers.
Every line has its own colour, name and number. In total there are 12 lines.
The metro runs from 5:30 AM to 1:00 AM. In peak hours trains run every 90 seconds, in the rest of the day every 3-4 minutes and in the evening every 6-10 minutes. The metro does not have a timetable, because the trains run at short intervals.
Tickets.
There are tickets for a certain number of rides and tickets for a certain time.
The moscow metro uses magnetic cards for tickets with a certain number of rides. (1,2,5,10,20,60 and 70 rides). These rides must be used within 30 days after the first ride. These tickets were first sold in 1993 as a test. All other tickets are Transport Cards (Smartcards). There are two kinds of smartcards, 'unlimited' and 'social'. Both kinds of cards can be used for 30, 90 or 1 year. Social cards are free for senior citizens and reduced for students.

The shortest is 502m between the stations Delovoy Center and Mezhdunarodnaya. The longest distance between stations is 6627 m between Krylatskoe and Strogino.

Metro 2.
Although this has not been officially said, many independent studies say that there is a second, deeper metro system designed for emergency evacuation of important city personnel in case of attack. It is believed that it consists of a single track and connects the Kremlin, chief HQ (Genshtab), Lubyanka (FSB Headquarters) and the Ministry of Defence, as well as numerous other secret installations. There are also entrances to the system from several civilian buildings such as the Russian State Library, Moscow State University (MSU) and at least two stations of the regular metro.[citation needed] It is speculated that these would allow for the evacuation of a small number of randomly chosen civilians, in addition to most of the elite military personnel. The only known junction between the secret system and normal Metro is behind the station Sportivnaya of the Sokolnicheskaya Line.
