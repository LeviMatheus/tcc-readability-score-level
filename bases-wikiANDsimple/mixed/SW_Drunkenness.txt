Drunkenness is the state of intoxication by alcohol. In this state, mind and body become impaired. Common symptoms may include slurred speech, poor balance, poor coordination, reddened face and reddened eyes. Depending on the level of intoxication, there may also be good feelings. Small to moderate aomunts of alcohol can lower social and sexual inhibition. Drinking large amounts of alcohol may lead to a hangover the next day. People that are intoxicated usually change their behaviour.
Many countries have laws that say that people who have drunk (a certain amount of) alcohol may not do certain things. That way, it is illegal to drive a car while drunk.
