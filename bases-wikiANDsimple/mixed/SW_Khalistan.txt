Sikh Republic of Khalistan is a non-independent country in the Indian occupied territories of Punjab (East), Haryana and Himachal Pradesh. It was proposed to create an independent state, with this territory, and a few neighbouring ones. In a meeting of Sikh leaders in 1986, it was decided that an independent state should be created. Independence was declared on October 7, 1987. This idea has been met with opposition, leading to violence. Indira Gandhi was killed because of this.
The capital city of the self-proclaimed state seems to be Chandigarh.
