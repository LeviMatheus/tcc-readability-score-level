"Saturday Night Fever" is a 1977 movie. It stars John Travolta as a young man named Tony Manero, who tries to escape his problem-filled life in Brooklyn by dancing at a dance club in New York City. The soundtrack (an album that has songs that were heard in the movie) of the movie was provided by The Bee Gees and many other artists and both the album and movie were very popular. There are two versions of the movie: the original R-rated version and the PG-rated version which came out a year later so the movie could be popular with younger people. A sequel called "Staying Alive" was released in 1983.
