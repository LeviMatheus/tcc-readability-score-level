Evolve by Leveling.
This is the most common of the ways that Pokémon evolve. Pokémon in this category evolve whenever they reach a certain level.
Other Information.
Keep in mind that this is only one example out of all of them. There are actually too many Pokémon that evolve from leveling to list.
Evolve by Evolution Stones.
This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon can only evolve if they are given certain evolution stones. If they are given an evolution stone, be prepared to have it not be able to learn the moves that it would normally have learned.
Evolve by Trade.
This is another way that Pokémon evolve. Some Pokémon only evolve if they are traded to a friend.
Evolve by Trade w/Items.
Another way in this same category are Pokémon that only evolve if traded to a friend "with" an item attached to it.
Example.
Example: Eevee only evolves into either Umbreon or Espeon if it gains lots of happiness. If it is evolved by happiness during the day, it will change into Espeon; if at night, then Umbreon.
Other Information.
Sometimes, this way of evolving is combined with another way, in the case of Togetic evolving into Togekiss.
