"Cyclamen" is a genus of 20 species of flowering plants, classified in the family Myrsinaceae. The genus is most widely known by its scientific name Cyclamen being taken into common usage; other names occasionally confusingly, persian violet (it is not related to the violets), or primrose (neither is it a primrose), is to remember Cyclamen was classified in Primulaceae families by authorities.
Cyclamen are native to the Mediterranean region from Spain east to Iran, and also in northeast Africa south to Somalia. They are perennial herbaceous aestivating plants, with a surface or underground tuber (derived from the hypocotyl) 4-12 cm diameter, which produces leaves in late winter, and flowers in the autumn; the leaves die down during the hottest part of the Mediterranean summer drought to conserve water. Each leaf or flower grows on its own stem, which shoots up from the hypocotyl. The variegation is thought by some botanists to be a form of natural disruptive camouflage to reduce grazing damage by animals.
The hypocotyl grows leaves and flowers on stems, either one flower or one leaf per stem. The stem for leaves and flowers appears identical except in height. The leaves grow on stems of around 6cm height.
