Metabolism is the system of chemical activities by which a living thing gets power (energy) from other things such as food. This depends, for example, on how often someone eats. If they are hungry their metabolism slows down dramatically. Metabolism uses energy to fuel all organs involved in digestion and respiration and so on. The amount of energy used to carry out these life processes is called the BMR-rate or "basal metabolic rate". The bigger someone is, the lower their metabolism rate would become. This is due to a lower volume to surface area ratio.
