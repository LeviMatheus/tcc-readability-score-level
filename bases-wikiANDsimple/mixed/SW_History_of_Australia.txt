People have lived in Australia for more than 50,000 years. The first people in Australia were the Aboriginal people. We think they came by boat from the islands of what is now Indonesia. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by hunting, fishing and gathering food. They lived in bands, and they spoke many different languages.
In 1606 people from the Netherlands, France, and Britain found the land currently known as Australia. First they found the north and west coast. This was dry and apparently uninhabitable land, and they found no economic reasons to stay. But in 1770 a British sailor, Captain James Cook, encountered the east coast of Australia. He called it New South Wales, and claimed it for Britain. He thought it would be a good place to settle.
In 1788 the British sent a fleet of ships to settle Australia. Britain needed a place to send its convicts (people who had been sent to jail for theft and other crimes). Its jails were full. This First Fleet settled at a place they called Sydney. For the first few years they did not have much food, and life was very hard. But soon they began to farm, and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started.
Soon people from Sydney found other parts of Australia. George Bass and Matthew Flinders sailed south to Tasmania. Hamilton Hume and William Hovell went south by land. They found the Murray River, and good land in Victoria. Thomas Mitchell went inland, and found more rivers. Others went north and found Queensland. Soon more towns and cities were started. Then, gold was found in 1851. Many more people wanted to come to Australia. The country grew very fast, and some people became very rich.
As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were killed, and many died from illness and hunger. Soon few were left, and they were made to live on small reserves.
In 1840 Britain stopped sending convicts to Australia. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. So in 1851 New South Wales, Victoria and the other colonies established their own Parliaments, where they could make their own laws.
The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to massive immigration and population growth across south east Australia and the generation of great wealth and industry.
The Commonwealth of Australia.
Until 1901, Australia was not a nation, it was six separate colonies governed by Britain. This worked well when everybody was British and there were only a few people. But now there was thousands of people and many of them had never been to Britain, an eight month journey away by sea. If people in one colony wanted to buy or sell things to people in another colony, they had to ask permission.
They decided to join together to form one new country, the Commonwealth of Australia. This was called Federation, and happened in 1901. But Australia was still part of the British Empire, and still felt very close to Britain and the British King. Australia soon had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.
Because Australia was a very big country, and was so close to Asia, the Australians feared that people from Asia might take the country over. So they passed a law that only people from Britain or other European countries could come to Australia. This was called the White Australia Policy. It lasted for more than 60 years.
In Australia at this time, the trade unions were very strong, and they started a political party, the Labor Party. Australia passed many laws to help the workers. Australia was also one of the first places in the world where women could vote.
In 1914, the First World War started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain and France, against Germany. Australian soldiers were sent to Gallipoli, in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on ANZAC Day. They also fought in France and Belgium. More than 60,000 Australians were killed in the war.
In 1939 the Second World War broke out. Again Australia joined in to help Britain. But in 1941 Japan attacked Australia, and Australians had to fight close to home for the first time. Many people feared that Japan would invade Australia. But with help from the United States, the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.
When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people in Europe who had lost their homes in the war. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came from Italy, Greece, Yugoslavia, Poland and other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like Turkey and Lebanon.
In the 1960s the White Australia Policy was ended. Many people came to Australia from China, Vietnam, Malaysia and other countries in Asia. Some Australians began to think of their country as being a part of Asia for the first time. But other Australians did not like this and said that Australia should keep its European character.
In the 1960s and 1970s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, because it could mine a lot of iron and other things from the ground that other countries wanted to buy. Companies from United States and Europe came to Australia to increase their profits, and many Australians got jobs with them. Australia also supported the United States in wars in Korea, Vietnam and Iraq. Some Australians protested against these wars. Australia's democracy meant that both sides could say what they thought.
Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has many problems. Some people are still poor, mainly those who do not have jobs, or whose farms do not make enough money. The Aboriginal people want some of their lands back, and Australians do not agree on what to do about this. Australia also doesn't know what to do with refugees - people who come to Australia by boat saying they have nowhere else to go. Some Australians want to let them stay and live in Australia, but some other Australians do not want to let them in.
