Immortality or eternal life is the idea of something which is alive that will stay alive forever. The opposite of immortality is mortality, which means a living thing can die. Right now, only a small number of living things are known to be immortal. These are mainly simple, lower forms of life like bacteria. Stories about immortal people or animals are popular in fiction and mythology, but not yet actually possible.
Some people are using science to look for a way to make immortality possible. Other people feel that death is what defines all living things, and as a natural part of life, should not be taken away.
