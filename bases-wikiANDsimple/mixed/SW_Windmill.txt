A windmill is an engine that is powered by the wind to produce energy. Often they are in a large building like traditional post mills, smock mills and tower mills. The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways, traditionally for grinding grain or spices, pumping water, sawing wood or hammering seeds. Modern wind power machines are used for generating electricity and are more commonly called wind turbines.
History.
A windwheel that operated an organ was described as early as the 1st century AD by the Greek engineer Hero. That could have been the first machine in history that used wind power. Vertical axle windmills were used in eastern Persia (Sistan) by the 9th century AD as described by Muslim geographers. Horizontal axle windmills of the type generally used today were invented in Northwestern Europe in the 1180s.
Early history.
The first windmills had long vertical shafts with rectangle shaped blades and appeared in Persia in the 9th century. The authenticity of an earlier anecdote of a windmill involving the second caliph Umar (634-644 AD) is questioned on the grounds of being a 10th century amendment. Made of six to twelve sails covered in reed matting or cloth, these windmills were used to grind corn or draw up water, they were quite different from the European versions. A similar type of vertical shaft windmill with rectangle blades, used for irrigation, can also be found in 13th century China.
Windmills in culture and literature.
Miguel de Cervantes' book "Don Quixote de La Mancha", - which helped cement the modern Spanish language and is one of the greatest works of fiction ever published - features an important scene in which Don Quixote attacks windmills that he believes to be violent giants. This gave worldwide fame to La Mancha and its windmills, and is the origin of the phrase "tilting at windmills", to describe an act of uselessness. The 'Moulin Rouge' translated directly in French to mean the 'Red Windmill'.
