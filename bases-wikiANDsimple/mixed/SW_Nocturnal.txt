Animals that are active during the night are called nocturnal. They hunt or feed during the night, and sleep during the day. Diurnal animals do it the other way around.
Scientists sometimes use the word "crepuscular" to describe nocturnal animals that aren't active when it is very dark at night; they are mostly active near dawn, dusk, and sometimes when the moon makes a lot of light.
Notcturnal animals also have a high sensitivity to their eyes, and when flashed really brightly with lights appear red, orange, amber, or topaz.
