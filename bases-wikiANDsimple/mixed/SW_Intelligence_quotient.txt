IQ or intelligence quotient is a measurement of how smart someone is. Scores are based on how advanced someone is compared to other people the same age.
IQ tests attempt to measure various aspects of general intelligence through the administration of activity tests. Most major IQ tests measure apparently different abilities. But they do correlate well.
People with low IQ scores are often disabled. This may or may not be permanent. People with very high IQs, along with other creative or able people, are geniuses.
People who have problems taking tests will also have problems taking an IQ test. They might be rated with a low score, and feel like they are unintelligent.
There is another problem with testing this way. Some of the tests will have questions that require a specific social or cultural background to be answered correctly. People who are not from that background may have different social values, and will therefore answer such questions differently. Also, many people argue that intelligence should not be represented by only one number.
Also, there are specific conditions and diseases that affect how the brain works. Such people may look like idiots, even if measured against a standard IQ tests. However, since such conditions favor the recognition and matching up of patterns (of all kinds), they may be ranked completely differently, if the test focuses on matching patterns.
Highest is 200 and lowest is 50
