Smurfette is the only female smurf in Smurfland. Most of the other smurfs like her because of her beauty. She is not the smartest smurf. Often she gets caught in traps while looking at herself in the mirror. She does not seem to have an attraction for many of the other smurfs.
Later other female smurfs appeared, although it is unclear how they came into being.
