(Russian, in full: Иосиф Виссарионович Сталин (Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin), born Джугашвили (Dzhugashvili), Georgian:(Ioseb Jughashvili); (December 18 [O.S. December 6] 1878 – March 5, 1953) was an adopted name of the Communist dictator, Iosev Jugashvili (December 18, 1878 – March 5, 1953). He was the second political leader of the Soviet Union, after Vladimir Lenin. He was a totalitarian ruler, and he is famous in history. He started a purge, and caused millions to be put to death.
He started his own form of communism, Stalinism.
Stalin cooperated with Hitler before the World War II and finally in 1939 they both made an agreement to conquer Poland and divide it between themselves. This is how World War II broke out.
But later on, in 1941, Hitler turned against Stalin and attacked the Soviet Union, trying to conquer it. After this happened, the USSR began working with the Allies to defeat Germany. Ultimately, Germany lost, but USSR had more casualties than any other country during the war.
When the World War II was over, the Soviet army ended up occupying many countries in Europe, such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and part of Germany, imposing communism on these countries.
Stalin continued to rule over the Soviet Union until he died. Stalin also militarized Russia, by focusing the country's time and energy towards weapons, vehicles, and the armed forces.
Stalin died of a stroke in the year 1953, due to warfarin. He was followed by Lavrentiy Beria, Nikita Khrushchev, and Georgi Malenkov. The three of them began a process called "De-Stalinization", which involved removing the political system that Stalin created.
