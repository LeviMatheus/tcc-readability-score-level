Turkish ("Türkçe") is a language is spoken natively in Republic of Turkey, Cyprus, Bulgaria, Greece, and other countries of the former Ottoman Empire, as well as by several million emigrants in Europe.
Turkish is a Turkic language and in Altaic language family. Turkish has vowel harmony, like Finnish and Hungarian. Word order is usually Subject Object Verb (SOV).
Turkish used to be written with the Arabic Alphabet from about 1000 AD to 1928. In the Ottoman Empire, Turkish language had a rich literature, and many books were written in it. However, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk changed it to Latin Alphabet because he wanted his country to be integrated with western countries to take advantages of technologic improvements of them. European countries were developed very fast after the renaissance and reform and they leave Osmanlı Empire (Ottoman Empire) behind. As a result, most Turks now cannot read texts written before the change.
This language is most closely related to other Turkic languages, including Uzbek, Turkmen, and Kazakh. There is another theory that Turkish is part of a larger Altaic family of languages, which also includes Japanese, Mongolian, and Korean
