Intereference is something that happens when two or more waves are in the same space. There are two kinds of interference, and these are constructive interference and destructive interference. When the waves have the same wavelength, they will always experience either constructive or destructive interference, but if the waves have different wavelengths, they will experience sometimes constructive interference and sometimes destructive interference.
Constructive Interference.
Constructive Interference happens when two or more waves are in the same space and in phase. When this happens, the waves' amplitudes add together and the total is greater than the amplitude of any of the waves by themselves. This causes the waves to appear more intense.
Destructive Interference.
Destructive Interference happens when two or more waves are in the same place and out of phase. When this happens, the waves' amplitudes add together and the total is less than the amplitude of any of the waves by themselves. This causes the waves to appear less intense.
