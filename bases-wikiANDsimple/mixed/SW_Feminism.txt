Feminism is a social and political movement. Feminism is about changing the way that people see men and women. Feminism said that women were poorly treated in the past and that this must stop. Somebody who follows feminism is called a feminist.
There are also many other types of feminism.
History of feminism.
Feminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women. This idea was put forward by some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill. Later feminists in the early 20th century also said that women should be allowed to vote in a democracy. Many women felt very strongly that they should be allowed to vote and there were many protests. These women were called Suffragettes. This is because they were fighting for Universal Suffrage which means everybody is able to vote. The Suffragettes staged many protests for their rights. Some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics. After women received the vote, feminism worked to make all of society more equal for women.
Anti-feminism.
Some people do not like feminism because it wants to change society and may reduce the power of men. Some religious people say that feminism is not what God wanted. For example, in the Bible, it says that God made Eve (the first woman) as a companion for Adam (the first man), and people think this means he made women to serve and be ruled by men. However, not all religious people think this and some feel that God created men and women to be equal so that feminism is actually a very good thing. A resistant reading as to why feminism has been such a controversial issue is that they have fought for their rights which have negatively affected others, plus they have created a marginalised social group in society that conveys hatred to men and a desire to take over man's place in ruling the world.
