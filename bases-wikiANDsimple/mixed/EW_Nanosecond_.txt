A nanosecond (ns) is an SI unit of time equal to one billionth of a second, that is, of a second, or 10 seconds.
The term combines the prefix "nano-" with the basic unit for one-sixtieth of a minute.
A nanosecond is equal to 1000 picoseconds or  microsecond. Time units ranging between 10 and 10 seconds are typically expressed as tens or hundreds of nanoseconds.
Time units of this granularity are commonly found in telecommunications, pulsed lasers, and related aspects of electronics.
