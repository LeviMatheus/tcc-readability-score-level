The minimum wage is the least amount of money that employees of a business can be paid.
Minimum wage is a relative term. Different countries have different minimum wages. Nunavut in Canada has a minimum wage of $8.50 per hour. Ontario, another place in Canada has a minimum wage of $8.00 per hour, but they want to raise it to $10.25 by 2010.
Some people think the minimum wage should be raised, so poor people will have more money. Others think it is worse because the government won't have enough money to pay all the employees, so they will raise the taxes or raise the inflation.
