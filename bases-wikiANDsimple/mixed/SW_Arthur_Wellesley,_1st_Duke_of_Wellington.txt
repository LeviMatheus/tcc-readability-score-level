Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, KG, GCB, GCH, PC, FRS (c. 1 May, 1769 â€“ 14 September, 1852) was an Irish-born British soldier and statesman. He is widely thought to be one of the best military and political people of the 19th century. Wellington was a Tory Prime Minister of the United Kingdom two times. He was one of the leading figures in the House of Lords until his retirement in 1846.
Starting as an ensign in the British Army, he served well in the Napoleonic Wars, eventually reaching the rank of field marshal. As a general, Wellington is often compared to the 1st Duke of Marlborough. They had many things in common including dealing in politics after a highly successful military career.
