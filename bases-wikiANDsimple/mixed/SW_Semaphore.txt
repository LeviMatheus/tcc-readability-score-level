A Semaphore is an installation used to send optical signals. It is also known as Optical telegraph. Common system include signal towers with special installations on them or hand-held flags. The meaning of the signal is determined by the position of the elements, for example the flags. The signal can be read when it is in a stable position. In modern usage, it refers to signalling with a set of flags.
Signal towers came before the electric telegraph. They were faster than sending out post riders with the information.
