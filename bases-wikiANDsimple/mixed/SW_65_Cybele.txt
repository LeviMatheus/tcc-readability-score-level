65 Cybele is one of the biggest asteroids in the main belt. It gives its name to the Cybele asteroids which orbit outward from the Sun from the 2:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. As a C-type asteroid it is dark in color and made of carbonate. It was found on March 8 1861 by Ernst Tempel and named after Cybele the earth goddess.
The first Cybelian stellar occultation was seen on October 17, 1979 in the Soviet Union. A diameter of 230 km was concluded, closely matching the diameter of 237 km determined by the IRAS satellite. During the same occultation, a hint of a possible 11 km wide moon was detected.
