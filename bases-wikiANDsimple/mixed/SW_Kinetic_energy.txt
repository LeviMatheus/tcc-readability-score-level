Kinetic energy is the energy which things have because they are moving. So you can think of it as the energy of movement. This energy can be changed into other sorts of energy such as heat (if something hits with something soft and does not bounce), potential energy (if it is moving upwards and gets higher), or even light (if it is moving very, very fast or if it hits something which sparks like flint or iron/Aluminium). However, heat, light, sound, mechanical energy,and other types of energy are also types of kinetic energy.
Meteors, bullets from a gun, and a kicked football all have kinetic energy.
