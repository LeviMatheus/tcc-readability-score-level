"Build God, Then We'll Talk" is the fifth and last official single, written by Ryan Ross, from Panic at the Disco's 2005 album, "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out", including the radio-only single "The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide Is Press Coverage".
Song information.
The song is the last song on Panic at the Disco's début album "A Fever You Can't Sweat Out".
The bridge melody of "Build God, Then We'll Talk" is a derivative of the melody of the chorus of "My Favorite Things" from "The Sound of Music". The lyrics in the bridge also directly satirize the lyrics of "My Favorite Things".
The song depicts the story of a young attractive lawyer who engages in intercourse with a prostitute. What the lawyer does not know is that this particular prostitute has struck a deal with the police. When the police arrive at the motel later, the prostitute is surprised and drops her purse, which holds illegal drugs. In exchange for not arresting her, the constable sleeps with her instead. The chorus' line, "what a wonderful caricature of intimacy," teases the falseness in many relationships, and particularly all the lies and double crossings in the song's relationships.
Music video.
The video shows the story of a "pornomime" and a girl who falls in love after she watches one of his performances. Their relationship is a fake one. Both "relationships" includes a fake feeling of confidence and are really useless in meaning.
The mime and his girlfriend both walk in on each other having affairs (pretended, of course), again showing the emptiness of their fake relationships. They are not making love to real people — it is a false impression. The video is the first from the band to be web-exclusive, mostly because they felt it was too offensive for television, but it has aired on MTV2 in the UK and is available on Music Choice On-demand.
The band does not appear in this video.
