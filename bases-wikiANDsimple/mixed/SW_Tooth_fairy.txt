The Tooth fairy is a fictional character found in modern folklore.
Around the world, families have many different traditions to celebrate the loss of a child's tooth, especially a first tooth. Many of the traditions involve throwing a tooth on a roof, under a house, burying it under a tree, or leaving it for a rodent.
One of the most famous traditions is leaving a tooth under a pillow for the Tooth Fairy. This tradition is very popular in the United States as well as other countries. The Tooth Fairy will take the tooth away while the child is sleeping and leave some money in its place. Sometimes the Tooth Fairy may also leave a note. If the child does not go to sleep the Tooth Fairy will not come.
Some people believe that the Tooth Fairy is named Fatina and lives in Neverland, along with Tinkerbell. The belief is that Fatina creates a magic powder from children's teeth that protects the fairies from hawks who might otherwise eat them.
