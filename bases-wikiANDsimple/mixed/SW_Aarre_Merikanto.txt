Aarre Merikanto (June 29, 1893 - September 29, 1958) was a Finnish composer. His parents were Liisa HÃ¤yrynen and the composer Oskar Merikanto.
Merikanto was born in 1893. He studied music in Helsinki (1911), Leipzig (1912-1914) and Moscow (1916-1917). He tried composing an opera for the first time when he was 18 years old.
