The Clovis culture was the first widely spread Indian culture in the Americas. The Clovis people lived in the Americas about 13,000 years ago. They lived there for between 200 and 800 years. Different sources list different lengths of time in that range.
They had a special way of making tools like spear tips and knives made from stones. Artifacts that they made made in this way can be found in many places in North America. The Clovis way of making tools only lasted between 500 and 1000 years. After that, other ways became more popular.
They are called "Clovis culture" because archaeologists first found their artifacts at a place called Clovis, New Mexico.
