In British, Australian, New Zealand, and some Canadian universities, a tutor is often but not always a postgraduate student or a lecturer who conducts a seminar for undergraduate students. These seminars are often known as a tutorial. In the United States and the rest of Canada, a tutor is known as a teaching assistant.
Secondary school form tutors.
In English and Irish secondary schools, form tutors are similar to American home room teachers. They are in charge of a group of students in a particular year group.
Peer Tutoring.
In the United States, tutors are students teaching other students of the same or similar age or grade level. When peer tutors are trained how to tutor correctly, peer tutoring is both academically and cost effective.
