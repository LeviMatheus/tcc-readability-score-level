The trunk is the main body of the tree. In terms of botany it means the main structural member of a tree that is directly connected to the roots and which supports the branches. The trunk is also often called the bole. The trunk is covered by the bark, which protects the tree against damage and often differs markedly from the bottom of the trunk to the top, depending on the species. The trunk, or bole, is the most important part of the tree for timber production.
