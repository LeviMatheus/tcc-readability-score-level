Nynorsk (almost New Norwegian) is one of the two officially standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. It is based on Norwegian dialects and was created by Ivar Aasen during the 19th century to show a Norwegian alternative to the Danish language (upon which Bokmål is based) which was commonly written in Norway at the time.
