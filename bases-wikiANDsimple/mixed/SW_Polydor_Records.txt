Polydor UK.
Though Polydor's American branch is gone, in the United Kingdom, however, Polydor continues to sign chart-topping acts and remains one of the strongest imprints in the country â€” with artists such as Klaxons, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Take That and Kaiser Chiefs. It also acts as the UK label for American-based acts under Interscope-Geffen-A&M like Eminem and Gwen Stefani.
In Spring 2006, Polydor launched Fascination Records, a music label dedicated to pop music. Both Girls Aloud and Sophie Ellis-Bextor transferred to the new label.
