Jane Seymour (c. 1508 or 1509 â€“ October 24, 1537) was the third wife of King Henry VIII of England. She should not be confused with the actress who uses the same name.
Biography.
Jane Seymour was the child of John Seymour and Margaret Wentworth. She was a lady-in-waiting to Catherine of Aragon, the first wife of Henry VIII. When Henry divorced his first wife and married Anne Boleyn, Jane continued to be a lady-in-waiting. Henry VIII noticed Jane at court and had already fallen in love with her by the time Anne Boleyn was executed. He became betrothed to Jane on the day after the execution, and they were married ten days later, on May 30 1536. When Jane became queen, she ran the royal court in a strict and formal way, and her only close friends were Anne Stanhope and Elizabeth Seymour.
In early 1537, Jane became pregnant and developed a craving for quail. In October of 1537, she gave birth to the son that Henry VIII wanted so much. They named him Edward and he was later to be King Edward VI of England. Soon, Jane became very ill with fever, and she died on October 24, 1537. Jane never had a coronation, and was married to Henry for only a year and a half before she died (May 30th 1536-October 24th 1537). Henry had loved Jane the most of all his wives, because she was the one who gave him a son. Even though he was married another three times after Jane's death, he always grieved for her. When Henry died, he asked to be buried next to Jane.
