A motorcycle is a vehicle, ridden for transportation. It does not have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2 wheels like a bicycle. But it has a motor like a car.
Nowadays (2008), motorcycles (bikes) are used both for transportation and extreme sports. Since motorcycles can be lighter than cars, they can accelerate more quickly. On-road bikes (ones that are allowed on public roads) must have a special type of driver's licence to be ridden legally. Off-road bikes are not allowed with traffic on the road. Speed and stunts are the main aims for off-road bike sports. Many on-road bikes are much faster than off-road bikes and can be used in sport like cars are in Formula 1 racing.
