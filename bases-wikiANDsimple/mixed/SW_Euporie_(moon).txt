Euporie or is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.
Euporie is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 19,088,000 km in 538.780 days, at an inclination of 145° to the ecliptic (145° to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.0960.
It was named in August 2003 after Euporie, a Greek goddess of abundance and one of the Horae in Greek mythology (and thus a daughter of Zeus).
It is the closest member of the Ananke group, retrograde non-spherical moons which orbit Jupiter between 19,300,000 and 22,700,000 km, at inclinations of about 150°.
