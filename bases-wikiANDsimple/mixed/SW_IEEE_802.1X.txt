IEEE 802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based Network Access Control; it is part of the IEEE 802 (802.1) group of protocols. It requires a RADIUS server. It provides authentication to devices attached to a LAN port, establishing a point-to-point connection or preventing access from that port if authentication fails. It is used for certain closed wireless access points, and is based on the EAP, Extensible Authentication Protocol (RFC 2284). RFC 2284 has been obsoleted by RFC 3748.
