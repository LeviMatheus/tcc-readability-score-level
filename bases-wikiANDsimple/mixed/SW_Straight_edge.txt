Straight Edge (Often called sXe) is a lifestyle without drugs, tobacco, or alcohol. Some followers of Straight Edge also abstain from illegal or casual sex.
It is usually represented by three X's (XXX).
For some, no drug use includes caffeine which is a stimulant drug. Some will accept drugs such as codeine or morphine for medical reasons.
Some followers of Straight Edge will not use Ny-Quil or Day-Quil because they contain alcohol.
Those Straight Edgers who quit casual or illegal sex won't have one-night stands and will wait until they are in a committed relationship to have sex.
People have associated sXe as gang affiliation, but it is a way of life such as being a vegetarian.
