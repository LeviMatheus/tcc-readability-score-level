An alphabet is a writing system, a list of symbols for writing. A symbol in an alphabet is usually called a "letter". In an alphabet, each letter is a symbol for a sound.
The name "alphabet" comes from "Aleph" and "Beth", the first two letters in the Phoenician Alphabet.
The alphabet in this article is the Latin alphabet (or "Roman alphabet"). It was first used in Ancient Rome to write Latin. Today many languages also use the Latin alphabet, and it is the most used alphabet.
Other writing systems.
Other writing systems do not use symbols that mean a sound, but symbols that mean a word or a syllable. In the past such writing systems were used by many cultures, but today they are almost only used by languages people speak in Asia.
