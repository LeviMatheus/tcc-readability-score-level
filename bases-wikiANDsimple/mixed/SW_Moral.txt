A moral is the right thing to do. A good person can be said to "have morals" or to "do moral things". Sometimes a person gets a moral from what they think. People can also get their morals from their religion, parents, friends, school, or reading a book. People that write morals are called moralists.
It can also be a lesson that someone learns in a book or story. It is usually one line at the end of the story ("The moral of this story is..."). Fables are stories with a moral.
The opposites of "moral" are "immoral", meaning the wrong thing to do, and "amoral", meaning without any moral.
