A hate crime is when someone hurts another person because of prejudice against a group the victim belongs to. It is usually not because of something the victim did or said. It is just because they are a part of a certain group. This hurt can be physical violence or can be words that hurt (insults).
This can be because of prejudice about the victim's sex, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender identity, class, sexual orientation, age, or other things about them.
