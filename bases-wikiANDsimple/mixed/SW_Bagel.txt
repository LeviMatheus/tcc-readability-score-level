Bagels are a type of bread made with flour. They look like doughnuts, because like doughnuts, bagels are a circle of dough. However, a doughnut is a sweet dough that is deep-fried in oil, and bagels are boiled in water and then baked in an oven.
Serving.
Bagels are often toasted in a toaster and then paired with foods like cream cheese (a soft cheese that tastes a little sweet) and jam, or with butter. Bagels can also be used to make sandwiches, with meat (for example smoked salmon) and egg and cheese. Bagel sandwiches are usually eaten for breakfast or lunch.
