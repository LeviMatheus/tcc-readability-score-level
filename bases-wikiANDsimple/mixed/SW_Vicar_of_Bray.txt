Wooden Barque(Conflicting info shows the Vicar Of Bray to be either a Brig or a Barque)
Built in Whitehaven, by Robert Hardy.
By 1849, at the time of the California Gold Rush, she was part of a vast fleet of ships, perhaps numbering in the thousands, that sailed to San Francisco. Today there is a group in San Francisco (Bring the Vicar Home Committee) proposing her return and at least partial restoration.
