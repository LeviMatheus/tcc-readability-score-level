In mathematics, specifically commutative algebra, Hilbert's basis theorem says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.
Statement.
If formula_1 is a ring, let formula_2 denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate formula_3 over formula_1. Hilbert proved that if formula_1 is "not too large", in the sense that if formula_1 is Noetherian, the same must be true for formula_2. Formally,
Hilbert's Basis Theorem. If formula_1 is a Noetherian ring, then formula_2 is a Noetherian ring.
Corollary. If formula_1 is a Noetherian ring, then formula_11 is a Noetherian ring.
This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations. Hilbert proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.
Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gr√∂bner bases.
Proof.
Remark. We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered; the proof for the right case is similar.
First Proof.
Suppose formula_14 is a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice) there is a sequence formula_15 of polynomials such that if formula_16 is the left ideal generated by formula_17 then formula_18 is of minimal degree. It is clear that formula_19 is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let formula_20 be the leading coefficient of formula_21 and let formula_22 be the left ideal in formula_1 generated by formula_24. Since formula_1 is Noetherian the chain of ideals
must terminate. Thus formula_27 for some integer formula_28. So in particular,
Now consider
whose leading term is equal to that of formula_31; moreover, formula_32. However, formula_33, which means that formula_34 has degree less than formula_31, contradicting the minimality.
Second Proof.
Let formula_14 be a left-ideal. Let formula_37 be the set of leading coefficients of members of formula_38. This is obviously a left-ideal over formula_1, and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of formula_38; say formula_41. Let formula_42 be the maximum of the set formula_43, and let formula_44 be the set of leading coefficients of members of formula_38, whose degree is formula_46. As before, the formula_44 are left-ideals over formula_1, and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of formula_38, say
with degrees formula_46. Now let formula_52 be the left-ideal generated by:
We have formula_54 and claim also formula_55. Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let formula_56 be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by formula_57.
Thus our claim holds, and formula_73 which is finitely generated.
Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of formula_3 multiplying the factors were non-negative in the constructions.
Applications.
Let formula_1 be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.
Formal proofs.
Formal proofs of Hilbert's basis theorem has been verified through the Mizar project (see HILBASIS file) and Lean (see ring_theory.polynomial).
