The United States Virgin Islands are a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea and are currently owned and under the authority of the United States Government. They were formerly owned by Denmark (and called "Danish West Indies"), and were sold to the U.S on January 17, 1917, because of fear that the Germans would capture them and use them as a submarine base in World War I.
