A common cold is a viral infectious disease. It affects the respiratory system, like the nose and the throat. It is characterized by a running nose, and sneezing, sometimes coughing. There is currently no treatment for the disease. There are drugs that can stop the symptoms, though. It is one of the most common diseases today.
Preventing the disease.
A good way to prevent the disease is to wash hands often, with soap. Antibacterial soaps have no effect on the virus, but the action of washing (scrubbing) will scrub the viruses away.
Symptoms.
The virus can affect breathing and taste by swelling the blood vessels in your nose. If the nose is blocked, tasting food (drinks) can become uneasy.
