In compliance with these phonemic principles, Basic Roman explicates the vowel alternations in stressed syllables originating in the Great Vowel Shift of Early Modern English, offering a wider international perspective that transcends Chomsky’s defense of traditional English orthography. The Basic Roman system serves no particular standard of English pronunciation, but rather provides the means that could be used for the spelling of different varieties of English. The system uses 22 Roman letters to represent the set of English phonemes considered by J.C. Wells; the letters ‘j’, ‘q’, ‘w’ and ‘x’ are not used.
The Extended Basic Roman is close to one-to-one phoneme-grapheme correspondence, paving the way to a pronunciation respelling for English by means of the closely related Roman Phonetic Alphabet for English.
