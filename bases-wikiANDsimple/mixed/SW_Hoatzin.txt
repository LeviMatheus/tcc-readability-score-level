The Hoatzin ("Opisthocomus hoazin") is a bird are considered a relic from the age of the dinosaurs. They represent the only living member of the family Opisthocomidae, and its close relatives probably died out long ago. This feature is a remnant from what is considered the first species of bird, Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago. Hoatzins communicate through unusual sounds that resemble wheezing, grunting, growls, and hisses.
