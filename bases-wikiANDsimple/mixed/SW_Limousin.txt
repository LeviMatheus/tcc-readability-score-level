Limousin is one of the regions of France. Its capital is Limoges. With 42 people per square kilometer this is one of the least populated regions. About 710.000 people live on roughly 17.000 square kilometers.
The local economy has been recentered around services.
There is also now a substantial English population in the region: whilst some argue that this has had a detrimental effect on house prices, the English speaking community has invested millions of euros in local businesses (especially in the building sector) and has allowed the creation of a large number of small (English speaking) businesses.
