The Weißeritzkreis is a district ("Kreis") in the south of the Free State of Saxony, Germany. It borders the Czech Republic. The district was created in 1994 when the two districts Dippoldiswalde and Freital were merged.
During the flooding in August 2002 the river Weißeritz had to drain many times the normal amount of water, and a lot of buildings in the river valley - houses, streets and bridges were destroyed
