The flag of Australia is a national flag. In 1901, the states of Australia became a single country at the time of the Federation of Australia. A competition was held to design a flag for the new country. The flag has a blue background, the Union Jack, and six stars. Five stars are in the shape of the constellation the Southern Cross, the other is the Commonwealth Star. The flag has been used in Australia since 1903, but did not become the official flag until 1954.
Competition.
The winning design was flown from the top of the Exhibition Building. The Prime Minister Edmund Barton wrote to the Governor-General to get approval from the King for the new flag. This was officially announced on February 20, 1903.
Some of the designs in the competition showed the the stars of the Southern Cross with different numbers of points. This was simplified to seven points for the four largest stars and five for the small one. The Commonwealth Star had six points for the six states. This was the design in 1903. In 1912 an extra point was added to the Commonwealth Star for the Territories of Australia.
In 1934 the government published the proper details of how the flag should be made. The flag of the United Kingdom, the Union Jack was still the official flag in Australia until 1954. In 1954 the Australian Flag became the official Australian National Flag.
