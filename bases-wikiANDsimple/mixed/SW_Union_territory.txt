An Union Territory is a sub-national administrative division of India. Unlike the states, which have their own elected governments, union territories are ruled directly by the federal national government; the President of India appoints an Administrator or Lieutenant-Governor for each territory. As of 2006, there are seven union territories. Delhi was made the National Capital Territory in 1991 and is on its way to statehood.
Delhi and Pondicherry have their own elected legislative assemblies and councils of ministers, but their powers are limited; certain legislation must be reserved for the "consideration and assent" of the President of India.
