Income is the money that someone gets for business activities.
For individuals income usually means their wages or salary before any tax and other deductions has been made by their employer.
For business there is a difference between the USA, where it most often means the amount of money that a company earns after paying for all its costs, and the world outside the U.S., where the term is usually profit or earnings.
