Idi Amin Dada (mid 1920s â€“ 16 August 2003) was a repressive dictator of the African country of Uganda. The President of Tanzania at the time, Julius Nyerere, invaded Uganda to save the country from Idi Amin.
Amin is famous for sending all Asians, mainly from India and Pakistan, out of Uganda. He threw them out because he believed they were taking the jobs of Ugandans. Many of the Asians that left Uganda came back after Amin was thrown out.
Amin also supported the cause of Palestine freedom. This caused the famous hijacking of an Air France flight that landed in Uganda.
He died in 2003 in Saudi Arabia, where he lived after being thrown out of Uganda.
A 2006 movie, "The Last King of Scotland" is about Amin's government. Forest Whitaker won an Academy Award for best actor.
