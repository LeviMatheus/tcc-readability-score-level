657 Gunl√∂d is a C-type asteroid orbiting in the Main belt near the Eunomia family. However, it is not a family member but an unrelated asteroid in the area because it is made up differently than the members. Its diameter is about 43 km, its albedo around 0.042, and its rotation period is 15.7 hours.
It was found by August Kopff in 1908. Its provisional name was 1908 BV.
