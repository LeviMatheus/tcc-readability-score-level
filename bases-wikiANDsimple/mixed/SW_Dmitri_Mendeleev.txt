Dmitri Mendeleev (born Dmitriy Ivanovich Mendeleyev, February 8 {O.S. January 27) 1834 in Tobolsk â€“ February 2 (O.S. January 20) 1907 in Saint Petersburg) was a Russian chemist. He is said to be the main creator of the first version of the periodic table of elements. Many of the predictions made in his periodic table (such as the properties of elements undiscovered at the time) were later proved correct by experiments. It was said that Mendeleev liked to arranged his cards to any order- color, size, shape, number, what box it came from.
