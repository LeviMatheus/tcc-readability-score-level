323 Brucia was the first asteroid to be found by the use of pictures. It was also the first of over 200 asteroids found by Max Wolf, a pioneer in that method of finding astronomical objects. Found in 1891, it was named in honour of Catherine Wolfe Bruce, a noted patroness of the science of astronomy, who had given 10.000$ for the construction of the telescope used by Wolf.
It is also a Mars-crosser asteroid.
