The coat of arms of Denmark consists of three crowned blue lions with nine red hearts, all in a golden shield.
The seal of King Canute VI of Denmark is the oldest known example of the coat of arms of Denmark. It is from around 1190. The coat of arms used today was designed in 1819 and adopted by king Frederik VI.
Until around 1960 Denmark had a small and a large coat of arms and both were used by the government. The large coat of arms changed status and became the royal coat of arms - that is the coat of arms for the king.
The large coat of arms comprise symbols representing all parts of the Danish kingdom - or to be precise: all that used to be a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In the coat of arms shown to the left the upper left part of the shield (the three lions) represents Denmark. In the lower part the three crowns (only two are visible) represents Sweden. The polar bear represents Greenland and the ram represents the Faroe Islands. The two lions in the upper right side represents the principality of Slesvig and all the other symbols represents principalities in Germany and parts of present day Sweden that used to be ruled by the Danish king.
In 1972 when King Frederik IX died and Margrethe II became queen the large coat of arms was redesigned, and today it only comprises symbols representing the current parts of the Danish Kingdom.
