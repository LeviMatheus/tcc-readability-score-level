In team sports, a captain is a title given to the member of the team who has to make choices about strategy and teamwork while a game is happening.
This is most important when a game's rules say that the coach of a team cannot tell the players what they should do while a game is being played.
In some sports, team captains may have to talk with game officials about the way the rules are applied.
