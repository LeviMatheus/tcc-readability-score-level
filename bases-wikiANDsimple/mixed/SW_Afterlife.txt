The afterlife is what people believe happens after death. Different religions teach different things about the afterlife.
Some religions believe in reincarnation (to come back to life in a different body). These religions include Buddhism and Hinduism. Others believe you go to another place after you die, such as heaven or hell. Christianity and Jainism are two religions that believe in this. Others believe that some people change into spirits called ghosts.
