Nonmetal or non-metal means there is no metal traces or any at all in the substance or chemical element. They can be gases or elements that do not look like metals. Examples of gases are: hydrogen, helium, oxygen, nitrogen, fluorine, neon, argon, krypton, or radon, just to name a few. An example of a solid that is a nonmetal is sulfur. It is yellow and not shiny at all. An example of a liquid that is a nonmetal is bromine. It is red. A non metal is also a great insulator.
