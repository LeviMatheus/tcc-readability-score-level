The International Astronomical Union (IAU) is a international group that brings together the national astronomical groups from around the world. It was created in 1919. It was created to promote and protect the science of astronomy by getting different nations to work together. Its members are professional astronomers from all over the world, and they all work on research and education in astronomy. The IAU has good relationships with groups that include amateur astronomers. "National Members" are usually people with a high level of professional astronomy. The IAU is made up of 8,858 "Individual Members" in 85 countries. It has 62 "National Members".
The IAU is also the group in charge of naming objects in space and anything on them such as mountains and craters.
