The band performed their first concert on December 4,1995, then they were called Meld. Joey Jordison suggested naming the band Slipknot, after a song thay had made. The band started wearing make-up to make them look scary.
In February Steele left the band because of Religious beliefs. Craig Jones was hired as a replacement. Jones later became their full-time sampler. They hired Mick Thomson as a replacement guitarist. On Halloween 1996 Slipknot released their first demo Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat..
The band realised that their new songs needed more vocal melody so hired Corey Taylor. Colsefini became just a percussionist. At a show Colsefini announced that he was leaving the band. He was replaced by Greg Welts but he was fired from the band because he was lazy. Chris Fehn was hired as percussionist. In 1997 the band gave themselves numbers and wore coveralls while performing.
In 1998 DJ Sid Wilson joined after impressing the band. In 1999 Brainard decided to leave the band for personal reasons. Jim Root was his replacement. This left the band with the line-up they have kept ever since.
