Wikipedia () is a free,open content encyclopedia project in many languages owned by the American organization Wikimedia Foundation, headquartered in San Francisco, California. Its name is a mixture of "wiki" and encyclopedia. It was started on January 15, 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, based on an older internet encyclopedia named Nupedia. It is a wiki that runs using MediaWiki (like other Wikimedia projects).
People can change the pages in Wikipedia, or even create new ones. Wikipedia has a standard formatting that must apply for all pages in the encyclopedia.
As of December 2007, Wikipedia had about 9.25 million articles in 253 languages, and more than 1.74 billion words for all Wikipedias.
Despite gaining some popularity, the English Language Wikipedia has been criticized for showing a bias and unevenness. Editors of reference works such as the "Encyclop√¶dia Britannica" have questioned Wikipedia's utility and status as an encyclopedia.
