Mail, or chainmail, is a type of armour. It is made of small metal rings.
The word "mail" means the armour material, not the armour made from it. A mail shirt is a "hauberk", "haubergeon", "byrnie". Mail leggings are "chausses", mail hoods are "coif", and mail mittens are"mitons". A mail collar hanging from a helmet is "camail" or "aventail". A mail collar worn around the neck was called a "pixane" or "standard".
