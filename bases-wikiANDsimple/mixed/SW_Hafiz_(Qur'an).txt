Hafith or Hafiz (Arabic: حافظ قرآن or حافظ, plural "huffaz"), literally meaning 'guardian', is a term used by Muslims for people who have learnt completely the Qur'an by heart.
Overview.
The prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) lived in the 7th century CE, in Arabia. In those times, many people were not literate. The Arabs preserved their histories, genealogies, and poetry by memory alone. When the Holy Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) proclaimed the verses later collected as the Qur'an, his followers naturally learnt the words by heart.
