The Phasianidae is a family of birds which consists of the pheasants and patridges, and including junglefowl (including chicken). These are terrestrial species, variable in size but generally plump, with broad relatively short wings. Many have a spur on their legs.
Males of the larger species are often brightly coloured. The typical diet is seeds with some insects and berries.
