Eagles are large birds of prey that are related to hawks, falcons, and Old World vultures. Eagles hunt during the day and have very good eyesight.
The bald eagle is a large eagle from North America that is identified by its bright white head and tail. It is the national bird of the United States and usually eats fish.
The golden eagle is found over most of the world and it usually eats small mammals.
Sometimes, "eagle" can just mean any large hawk; as a group, eagles are not closely related to one another.
The largest eagle that has ever lived is Haast's Eagle. It is the only eagle in the world ever to have been top predator of its ecosystem. Though it is now extinct, it resided in New Zealand.
