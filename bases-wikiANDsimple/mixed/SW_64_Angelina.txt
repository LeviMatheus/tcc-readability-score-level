64 Angelina is a medium-sized Main belt asteroid and is an uncommon E-type asteroid. It is the third biggest E-type after 44 Nysa and 55 Pandora. It was thought to be the biggest of this class but recent work has shown that its diameter is only a quarter of what was previously thought.
It was found on March 4, 1861 by a prolific comet discoverer, E. W. Tempel. It was the first asteroid he found.
E-type asteroids show unusual brightening when at close opposition to the Sun. This phenomenon is also known in Jupiter's moons Io, Ganymede and Europa, and also Saturn's moon Iapetus.
