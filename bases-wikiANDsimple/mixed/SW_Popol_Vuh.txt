The Popol Vuh ("K'iche for "Council Book" or "Book of the Community"; "Popol Wu'uj" in modern spelling;) is a book written in the Classical Quiché language. It contains mythological stories and a genealogy of the rulers of the Post-Classic Quiché Maya kingdom of highland Guatemala.
The book contains a creation myth followed by mythological stories of two Hero Twins: Hunahpu (Modern K'iche': "Junajpu") and Xbalanque (Modern K'iche': "Xb‘alanke"). The second part of the book deals with details of the foundation and history of the Quiché kingdom.
The book is written in the Latin alphabet, but it is thought to have been based on an original Maya codex. The original manuscript which was written around 1550 has been lost, but a copy of another handwritten copy in the early 18th century exists today in Chicago.
The significance of the book is enormous since it is one of a small number of early Mesoamerican mythological texts — it is often considered the single most important piece of Mesoamerican literature.
