Zhang Fei (167-221) was a warrior in ancient China. He fought along with his brothers Liu Bei and Guan Yu for the restoration of the Han Dynasty.
In the battles against the Dong Zhuo, Zhang fended off the enemy general LÃ¼ Bu and was greatly rewarded by his then-ally Cao Cao. When Cao Cao tried to crush Liu Bei's folk in 207, Zhang Fei drew the whole enemy forces back by yelling really loud. Some historians believe that the yell crushed the bridge in front of him, some say that the leading general of Cao Cao's army died of fear.
Zhang Fei was later killed by his own officers, because after the death of his brother Guan Yu, he became a drunk.
