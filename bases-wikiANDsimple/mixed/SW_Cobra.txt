Cobras () are venomous snakes of the familys Elapidae, of several genera, but particularly "Naja". (Non-cobra elapidae include the taipans, brown snakes, tiger snakes, fierce snakes, coral snakes, mambas and sea snakes.) Cobras generally inhabit tropical and desert regions of Asia and Africa. When feeling threatened, cobras can tilt back and flatten their heads into their known by sight warning posture. The rest of the time their heads are symmetrical and they look much like any other snakes.
