21 Lutetia is a big Main belt asteroid of the M spectral type, about 100 kilometers in diameter. It will be the subject of a flyby by the "Rosetta" space probe in 2010.
The name Lutetia comes from the Latin name for Paris.
Characteristics.
What Lutetia is made up of has puzzled astronomers for some time, and its investigation has picked up in recent years in anticipation of the upcoming "Rosetta" flyby. While classified as the M spectral type, it does not display much evidence of metal on their surface.
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Lutetia's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (3°, 40°) or (β, λ) = (3°, 220°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 85°, or 89°, respectively, meaning that Lutetia spins at an approximately right angle to the ecliptic like e.g. Uranus.
Discovery.
Lutetia was found on November 15, 1852 by Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt from the balcony of his apartment in Paris.
Exploration.
On July 10, 2010, the European "Rosetta" comet probe will pass the asteroid with a minimum distance of 3000 km and a velocity of 15 kilometres per second on its way to Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In the run-up to this event the attention of astronomers has been drawn to Lutetia.
The flyby will be important for the understanding of the asteroids, since Lutetia will be the first M-type asteroid to be visited by a spacecraft.
There have been two reported stellar occultations by Lutetia: from Malta (1997) and Australia (2003), with only one chord each, roughly agreeing with IRAS measurements.
