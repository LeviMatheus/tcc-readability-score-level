For role in the sense of the performing arts see: Role (performing arts)
A role (sometimes spelled r√¥le) or a social role can be described as an expected behaviour of an individual.
More precisely one could say it is a set of connected behaviours, rights and obligations that a person has to follow in a social situation. It depends on social status and social position.
"Role confusion" is a situation where an individual has trouble to decide which role he/she should play. For example, one could be a college student who would attend a meeting of a particular recreational interest and find his or her teacher there. He would be in conflict between behaving as a student and as an enthusiast who shares the same interest as the teacher.
