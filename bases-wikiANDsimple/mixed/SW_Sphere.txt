A sphere is a shape in space that is like the surface of a ball, usually the terms ball and sphere are used alike, but in math, the precise (exact) definition only allows points in the 3 dimensional space which are uniformly and symmetrically allocated at a fixed length called radius of the sphere.
Examples of these are basketballs, superballs, and playground balls.
In other places sphere means the earth.
a sphere is the 3 dimensional analogue of a circle.
