Fruit is a type of food that is not always something one is able to eat. It is part of a tree or bush or sometimes grown out of the ground like watermelons, that contains seeds. For plants, fruits are used so that the plant can make new plants. When the fruit breaks apart, the seeds can get into mud and start growing. ()
Most fruits we eat contain a lot of water. They contain natural sugar. They have a large amount of dietary fiber at the peel, seeds, and fibrous parts. All fruits contain iron, and they are very low in protein and fat content.
Sometimes "to bear fruit" also means "to produce results".
