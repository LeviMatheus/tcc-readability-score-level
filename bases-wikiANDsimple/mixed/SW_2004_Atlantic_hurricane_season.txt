The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 2004, and lasted until November 30, 2004. These dates usually delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. However, the 2004 season went past these actual limits slightly, as Tropical Storm Otto formed on the last day of the season and lasted two days into December. The season was above average in activity, with fifteen named storms and one of the highest Accumulated Cyclone Energy totals ever recorded.
