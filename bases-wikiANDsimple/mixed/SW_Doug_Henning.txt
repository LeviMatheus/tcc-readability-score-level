Douglas James Henning (1947-2000) was a Canadian magician, illusionist and escape artist. He helped to re-popularize magic shows, during his heyday in the 1970s.
Henning's approach to magic and performing was different from earlier magicians. While magicians usually performed in black formal wear, Henning wore colorful clothes. He also studied psychology in college, to know how the human mind works.
He was a student of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and used Transcendental Meditation to help him focus and to relax. He tried to help the Maharishi open a theme park, called Vedaland. Henning also ran for public office in Canada, but lost the election.
Henning died in 2000 of liver cancer. Instead of normal medical treatments, he tried to cure himself through natural remedies and diet, but this did not work. After his death, Henning's widow kept the Vedaland campaign going.
