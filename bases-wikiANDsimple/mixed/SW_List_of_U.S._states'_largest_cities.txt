The only incorporated place in Hawaii is the City & County of Honolulu. A portion of it, the Honolulu District, is sometimes called the "city of Honolulu" for statistical reasons, although it has no government separate from that of the "City and County" as a whole. The U.S. Census Bureau defines Honolulu CDP (Census Designated Place) as the Honolulu District. For Hawaii, the largest CDPs are listed.
As of January 2006, New Orleans remains at a population of anywhere from 200,000-230,000 due to the effects of Hurricane Katrina which is only about 50% of the population before the hurricane. Many of the city's residents have moved to Baton Rouge or elsewhere, either short-term or permanently. When new Census estimates are released, it is expected that New Orleans will move down in the rankings.
