Hurricane Gilbert was a very powerful tropical storm which caused much damage to the Caribbean, Mexico and parts of South Texas in the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season. Before Hurricane Wilma in 2005, Hurricane Gilbert was the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic in terms of Barometric pressure.
This hurricane was similar to Hurricane Beulah and Hurricane Allen, but Hurricane Gilbert was unique in many ways.
