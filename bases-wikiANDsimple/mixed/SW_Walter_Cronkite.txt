Walter Leland Cronkite, Jr. (born November 4, 1916) is an American news reporter. He was the anchor of CBS News from 1962 to 1981. Big events he reported were ones such as when President John F. Kennedy got shot and killed; the Apollo 11 moon landing; the Vietnam War; and the Watergate scandal, which led to President Richard Nixon resigning from his position. Due to how much he knew and his honesty, he was often called "the most trusted man in America."
