Ritual Entertainment was a video game developer established in 1996 by Robert Atkins, Mark Dochtermann, Jim Dosé, Richard 'Levelord' Gray, Michael Hadwin, Harry Miller, and Tom Mustaine. Based in Dallas, Texas, Ritual Entertainment was formerly known as Hipnotic Interactive, during which period they began development of their signature video game "SiN".
History.
Members of the Ritual Entertainment development team have contributed game assets to other titles such as "American McGee's Alice", ', ', and "25 to Life", and are also the creators of "Übertools" for id Tech 3, which has been licensed for a number of other games.
Shortly after signing Hipnotic, publisher Activision claimed that Hipnotic had been at the core of the "Duke Nukem 3D" development team. "Duke Nukem 3D" developer 3D Realms vigorously denied this, stating that only five members of Hipnotic Interactive were former staff of 3D Realms, and of these five only three had a significant role in making "Duke Nukem 3D".
In late 1997, Hipnotic changed their name to Ritual Entertainment in order to avoid a trademark conflict with another video game developer, Hypnotix.
On January 24, 2007, developer MumboJumbo announced the acquisition of Ritual Entertainment. With this acquisition, Ritual's focus on traditional action-oriented games was changed to casual games, essentially "stalling" Ritual's latest game series, "SiN Episodes", after releasing only one episode out of a planned nine.
The purchase followed months of departures of several key employees including chief executive officer Steve Nix who became director of business development at id Software, vice president and co-founder Tom Mustaine who left to found Escalation Studios. Several months after the acquisition, community relations manager Steve Hessel left the company to join Splash Damage.
Prior to the announcement, on December 6, 2006, Ritual announced the appointment of Ken Harward as the company's new studio director.
