Taxonomy is a science. It is about the classification of all things living. Although it is most commonly used in biology, it can be used in other types of classification too. Taxonomy is used with different ranks, the lowest is a species. There can also be sub-species. An organism is a species if two organisms of the same kind can mate. This name is the scientific classification of that species. The name is the same all over the world, so that when scientists from different places talk or write about the living thing, they can understand each other.
When someone writes about this animal, the first time they write its name they will write "Felis silvestris catus". After the first time they write its name, they will only write the first letter of the Genus, so they will write "F. silvestris catus". This is known as binomial nomenclature, because it is a way to describe organisms using two names, the common name, and the scientific name.
Kingdom --> Phylum --> Class --> Order --> Family --> Genus --> Species
A mnemonic, or a saying to help a person remember something, for that is "King Phillip Came Over From Geneva Switzerland".
