The economy of Jersey is a highly developed social market economy. It is largely driven by international financial services and legal services, which accounted for 39.5% of total GVA in 2019, a 4% increase on 2018. Jersey is considered to be an offshore financial centre. Jersey has the preconditions to be a microstate, but it is a self-governing Crown dependency of the UK. It is considered to be a corportate tax haven by many organisations.
Other sectors include construction, retail, agriculture, tourism and telecommunications. Before the Second World War, Jersey's economy was dominated by agriculture, however after liberation, tourism to the island became popular. More recently, the finance industry recognised worth in operating in Jersey, which has now become the island's dominant industry.
In 2017, Jersey's GDP per capita was one of the highest in the world at $55,324. In 2019, the island's economy, as measured by GVA, grew by 2.1% in real terms to £4.97 billion. In December 2020, there were 1,350 people actively seeking work.
History.
Agriculture.
Until the 19th century, cider was the largest agricultural export with up to a quarter of the agricultural land given over to orchards. In 1839 for example, of cider were exported from Jersey to England alone, but by 1870 exports from Jersey had slumped to . Beer had replaced cider as a fashionable drink in the main export markets, and even the home market had switched to beer as the population became more urban. Potatoes overtook cider as the most important crop in Jersey in the 1840s. Small-scale cider production on farms for domestic consumption, particularly by seasonal workers from Brittany and mainland Normandy, was maintained, but by the mid-20th century production dwindled until only eight farms were producing cider for their own consumption in 1983. The number of orchards had been reduced to such a level that the destruction of trees in the Great Storm of 1987 demonstrated how close the Islands had come to losing many of its traditional cider apple varieties. A concerted effort was made to identify and preserve surviving varieties and new orchards were planted. As part of diversification, farmers have moved into commercial cider production, and the cider tradition is celebrated and marketed as a heritage experience.
Textiles.
The knitting of woollen garments was a thriving industry for Jersey during the 17th and 18th centuries.
Ship building.
Jersey was the 4th largest ship building area in the 19th century British Isles. See History of Jersey.
Historical exchange rates.
Jersey pounds per US dollar - 0.55 (2005), 0.6981 (January 2002), 0.6944 (2001), 0.6596 (2000), 0.6180 (1999), 0.6037 (1998), 0.6106 (1997); the Jersey pound is at par with the British pound.
Government spending and economic management.
Taxation.
Jersey does not have inheritance, wealth, corporate or capital gains tax. Jersey is considered to be a tax haven by a number of organisations. Jersey does not feature, however, in the March 2019 revised EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. The chair of the EU Tax Matters Subcommittee Paul Tang has criticised the list for not including "renowned tax havens" such as Jersey.
In 2020, Tax Justice ranked Jersey as the 16th on the Financial Secrecy Index, below larger countries such as the UK, however still placing at the lower end of the 'extreme danger zone' for offshore secrecy'. The island accounts of 0.46 per cent of the global offshore finance market, making a small player in the total market. 
Personal Tax.
Until the 20th century, the States relied on indirect taxation to finance the administration of Jersey. The levying of "impôts" (duties) different from those of the United Kingdom was granted by Charles II and remained in the hands of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats until 1921 when that body's tax raising powers were transferred to the Assembly of the States, leaving the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats to serve simply as licensing bench for the sale of alcohol (this fiscal reform also stripped the Lieutenant-Governor of most of his effective remaining administrative functions). 
The first income tax in Jersey was introduced in 1928. Income tax has been levied at a flat rate of 20% set by the occupying Germans during the Second World War. Jersey's tax is not entirely regressive, however. Exemption thresholds apply to those on lower incomes and tax reliefs exist for married couples, single parents, child day care and children. Residents living in Jersey under the high value residency scheme are charged 20% on the first £725,000 and 1% on anything over that amount.
Until February 2020, married women in Jersey did not have control over their own tax affairs. Since 1928, married couples were required to file tax receipts under their spouse's name, married women's earning were considered part of their spouses' earnings and male permission was required for women to be treated separately or to discuss her financial affairs with the tax office. For couples in same-sex marriages, the older partner was required to give permission for the younger. In 2020, a vote in the States Assembly (40 "pour", 2 abstentions) to reform the law to give both marriage partners equal rights over the couple's tax affairs passed to come into force from 2021.
Goods and services tax.
Historically, no value added tax (VAT) was levied in Jersey, with the result that luxury goods have often been cheaper than in the UK or in France. This provided an incentive for tourism from neighbouring countries. 
The States of Jersey introduced a goods and services tax (GST) in 2008. It was originally set at 3%, but rose to 5% on 1 June 2011 as part of the 2011 States budget. To try to prevent islanders living below the poverty line, the States of Jersey introduced an Income Support service in January 2008.
Although this is a form of VAT, there are a number of significant differences between the European VAT and Jersey's GST. It is charged at a much lower rate than UK or French VAT, so Jersey can still act as a low-tax shopping jurisdiction on certain items, however there are much fewer exemptions to GST policy. For example, no VAT is charged on female sanitary products (the so-called 'tampon tax') in the UK while GST still applies in Jersey.
VAT tax avoidance.
The absence of VAT also led to the growth of a fulfilment industry, whereby low-value luxury items, such as videos, lingerie and contact lenses are exported in a manner avoiding VAT on arrival, thus undercutting local prices on the same products. A number of companies, including off-island companies Tesco, HMV and Amazon and on-island companies Play.com and Blahdvd, operated this model. 
In 2005 the States of Jersey announced limits on licences granted to non-resident companies trading in this way. Low-value consignment relief provided the mechanism for VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands to the UK. In April 2012, the UK closed this loophole, leading to the closure of many island businesses and the loss of a number of jobs on the island.
The Social Security department introduced a Back to Work programme to deal with the job losses and Jersey Post had to suffer significant cut-backs in response to a reduction in fulfilment. The States appealed against the UK decision, but this failed. As a result of the new rule, the UK tax authorities reported a 200% rise in import VAT from the Channel Islands, estminated at £95 million per year.
Coroporation Tax.
Jersey has a corporate income tax. The standard rate for all corporations is 0%, however jersey is not a corporate-tax free jurisdiction. A 10% tax applies for regulated financial services companies and a 20% maximum tax rate applies for larger corporate retailers and utility and property income companies.
It is arguable that the people who benefit from Jersey's new tax structure are the owners of the large businesses that are separate or support the financial service based businesses. This is because they do not have to pay any corporation tax but will still benefit from the island's business.
In 2020, the Corporate Tax Heaven Index ranked Jersey 8th for 2021 with an haven score (a measure of the jurisidction's systems to be used for corporate tax abuse) of 100 out of 100, however only has 0.51% on the Global Scale Weight ranking.
Welfare state.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government introduced Co-Funded Payroll to support businesses.

Jersey-based financial organisations provide services to customers worldwide. In June 2020, it was reported that there were 13,450 jobs within this sector. The finance sector profits were about £1.18 billion in 2015.
Jersey is one of the top worldwide offshore financial centers It has been criticised for its tax practices, with many calling the island a tax haven. It attracts deposits from customers outside of the island, seeking the advantages such places offer, like reduced tax burdens. In 2020, Tax Justice ranked Jersey as the 16th on the Financial Secrecy Index, below larger countries such as the UK, however still placing at the lower end of the 'extreme danger zone' for offshore secrecy'. The island accounts of 0.46 per cent of the global offshore finance market, making a small player in the total market. 
In the second quarter of 2020, the total value of banking deposits held in Jersey decreased from £145.7bn to £141.2bn. There were 33,186 live companies on Jersey's register.

Construction.
Construction represented 7% of GVA during 2019. In June 2020 it was reported that 5,970 people were employed full-time in the construction and quarrying sector.
St Helier has a lot of ongoing construction projects. The reclamation of land opened in the 1980s new land for development in the town centre. This has led to development projects such as the Jersey International Finance Centre, Horizon and the new St Helier Waterfront project.
The GVA of the construction sector declined by 1% between 2018 and 2019.
Retail and wholesale.
As of June 2020 there were 6,940 jobs within Jersey's wholesale and retail trades. Retail and wholesale declined by 1% between 2018 and 2019.
Jersey has a large range of local and national shops. Sandpiper C.I. Limited operate a chain of stores in Jersey, their franchises include well-known names, such as Morrisons, Marks &amp; Spencer, Iceland, and Costa Coffee.
A number of online retailers, and fulfillment houses operate from the Channel Islands, including Jersey, supplying a variety of low-value goods such as CDs, DVDs, video games, and gadgets. Residents of the EU were choosing to order goods from Jersey, so as to benefit from a tax relief known as Low-value consignment relief (LVCR). UK residents, in particular, were taking advantage of this situation.
A local company, play.com grew substantially during the time that LVCR applied to Jersey. Notably, Amazon UK also took advantage of this by dispatching some low-value items from Jersey.
In April 2012 the UK Government made law changes to prevent the Channel Islands continued exploitation of LVCR, meaning that UK residents would have to pay the full VAT amount on items imported from the Channel Islands. Some goods are still sold and distributed from Jersey, despite these changes.
Agriculture.
In 2017, 33,301 vergées were dedicated to agriculture, with each holding having an average area of 78 vergées. Since 2006, there has been a reduction in the number of smaller holding areas, as have the number of larger holdings (64 in 2006 to 53 in 2017).

Tourism and hospitality.
Hospitality (hotels, restaurants and bars) made up 4.2% of Jersey's GVA in 2019. It is estimated that the wider contribution of tourism in particular is 8.3% (2017). Tourism is important for Jersey's taxation, making £12.5 million in GST (15% of the total). However, total spend is much higher, around £250 million. This creates 6,470 jobs.
Most tourist attractions are operated by private companies and nonprofit organisations, including companies owned, or funded by the States of Jersey. Elizabeth Castle, for example, is controlled by Jersey Heritage. Some other attractions are owned by the National Trust for Jersey. One notable attraction is Jersey Zoo in Trinity, a wildlife park founded by conservationist Gerald Durrell.
Transport, storage and communication.
This sector accounted for 3.5% of GVA during 2019. In December 2020, this sector had 1,950 private sector jobs in transport and storage and 1,810 private sector jobs in information and communications.

Cost of living.
Jersey has a high cost of living, due to transport costs and a lack of competition. In January 2021, Numbeo, an online cost-of-living index, reported that Jersey was the "world's 'most expensive place to live'."
Inflation.

The largest increases in RPI were in housing, household services, leisure services. Underlying inflation, as measured by the annual change in RPI(Y), increased by 2.3% over the twelve months to March 2020.
Historically, the highest RPI change was in September 2008 at 6.4% and the lowest was in September 2009 at -0.6%.
Seasonal workers.
The workforce in Jersey tends to increase during the summer months, with around 3,500 more people employed in the summer of 2008 than in the winter of 2007. These seasonal workers are mostly employed in agriculture, hotels, restaurants and bars.
International economic relationships.
Jersey has long been part of the UK's customs area. When the UK was part of the European Union, Jersey was part of the European Union Customs Union. In 2018, Jersey became part of a customs union with the United Kingdom. Therefore, there are no tariffs between the territories and a common external tariff on places outside the customs union. However Jersey retains the ability to impose specific prohibitions and restrictions at its border and retain autonomy in customs systems and fiscal matters.
