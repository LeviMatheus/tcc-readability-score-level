An orgasm is a sexual climax or peak. In a man, the feeling happens at the same time as he squirts semen out of his penis. In young boys, the feeling in the penis may happen, but there may be no semen. Semen release usually occurs only after puberty has started. Orgasm occurs as a result of continued sexual stimulation. During an orgasm, there is a strong feeling of excitement and intense physical pleasure. Sexual stimulation may be sexual intercourse, hand rubbing and squeezing, called masturbation, or other activities that excite the sex organs.
Sometimes, a person may fake an orgasm if their partner cannot make them have one. This is so their partner does not feel inadequate because they couldn't make them orgasm.
During an orgasm, a person's body usually spasms (shakes or trembles) and the person's brain activity changes quickly. When a man has an orgasm he feels a very strong and incredibly enjoyable feeling in his penis, which gets very stiff. As he ejaculates he releases semen through his penis tip without trying to. The hard penis becomes soft again after an orgasm. Female orgasm is also very enjoyable, but female ejaculation is much less common. Orgasms can happen when people are asleep. When men ejaculate in their sleep, this is often termed a "wet dream."
An orgasm happens for many animals when they have sex, in a similar way.
