Personality.
Austin Powers was a character seen as a parody of James Bond, and being influenced by Harry Palmer, characters played by Michael Caine (who would play Austin's father in Goldmember), and also being inspired by the flamboyant dress sense of Jason King.
The character of Austin Powers represents an archetype of 1960s Swinging London, with his advocacy for free love, his use of obscure expressions and his clothing style (including crushed velvet suits and Beatle boots).
Development.
Myers, Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs formed the faux British 1960s band Ming Tea after Myers' "Saturday Night Live" stint in the early 1990s. The band members all performed under pseudonyms with 1960s personas. Myers adopted the pseudonym and character of Austin Powers.
This group made a number of live club and television performances in character. Myers' then wife, Robin Ruzan, encouraged him to write a film based on Austin Powers. Obituaries of Simon Dee (1935â€“2009), the radio and television presenter, stated that his "Sixties grooviness" made him the inspiration for the character.
Mike Myers has claimed his father was the inspiration behind Austin Powers.
