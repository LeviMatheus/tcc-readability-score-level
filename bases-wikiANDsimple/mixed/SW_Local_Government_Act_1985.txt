The Local Government Act 1985 was an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Its main effect was to abolish the county councils of the metropolitan counties that had been set up in 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972, along with the Greater London Council that had been established in 1965.
The main provision, section 1 stated that "the Greater London Council; and the metropolitan county councils" shall not exist anymore.
It came into effect on April 1, 1986. The metropolitan boroughs and London boroughs, got some of the powers of the former institutions, but others wrnt to central government. At the time of the Act, one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties.
The act established a system of joint-boards to take over some of the functions of the abolished councils in the metropolitan counties and in Greater London. The joint-boards had councillors appointed by the boroughs.
The Act was passed by Margaret Thatcher's government after a series of disputes between the councils and the central government.
