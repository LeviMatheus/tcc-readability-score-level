Climate change means the variation in the Earth's global climate or in regional climates over time.
It describes changes in the state of the atmosphere over time scales ranging from decades to millions of years. These changes can be caused by processes internal to the Earth, forces from outside (e.g. variations in sunlight intensity) or, more recently, human activities.
