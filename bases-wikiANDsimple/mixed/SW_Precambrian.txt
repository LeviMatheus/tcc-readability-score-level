Pre-cambrian (or Precambrian) is a word used to describe a time period. It came before the Cambrian. It lasted from about 4.55 billion yeas ago to about 542 million years ago. It starts with the beginning of the Earth, about 4.55 billion years ago. When it ends, there were many hard-shelled animals around. It is named after the Roman name for Cymru / Wales, because rocks thought to be from this time were first studied there.
