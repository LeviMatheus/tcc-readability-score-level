The Kaaba is a large cube-shaped building located inside the mosque known as al-Masjid al-Haram in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. The mosque was built around the original Kaaba. Muslims believe it is a reflection of a heavenly house primarily built by Adam.
The Kaaba is the holiest place in Islam. Muslims are required to make a pilgrimage once in a lifetime to the Kaaba. As it is the most holiest place in Islam all Muslims pray towards this when they perform the five fardh (necessary acts mentioned in the Quran) Salaah or prayer. Religious idols or symbols from other religions are inside the building.
