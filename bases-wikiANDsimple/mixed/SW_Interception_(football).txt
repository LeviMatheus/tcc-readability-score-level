An interception or intercept is a move in football that uses a pass (either by foot or hand) being stopped by a player on the other teams. When this is done, the player's team who had caught the ball, would get possession of it. Many leagues use interceptions, some are Canadian and American football football, as well as rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football and Gaelic football.
