VRS stands for Video Relay Service. This service is quickly replacing the TTY for deaf people to make phone calls.
VRS uses a video camera and a high-speed Internet connection, to let people call friends, family, and business associates. People who use VRS can communicate in sign language instead of typing on a keyboard. A deaf or hard of hearing person can use a remote control and call an interpreter. Once the interpreter is on their screen, the caller can call any hearing person and have a phone conversation through the interpreter.
Right now, VRS is only available in the United States. However, only one person has to be in the United States. If the deaf person is in America, they can call anybody in the world. If the deaf person is in another country, they can call anybody in the United States.
