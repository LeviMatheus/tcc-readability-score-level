A number is called a perfect number if by adding all the positive divisors of the number (except itself), the result is the number itself.
Six is the first perfect number. Its divisors (other than the number itself: 6) are 1, 2, and 3 and 1 + 2 + 3 equals 6. Other perfect numbers include 28, 496 and 8128.
Perfect numbers that are even.
Euclid saw that 2"n" − 1 is a prime number in these four cases.He then proved that the formula 2"n"−1(2"n" − 1) gives an even perfect number whenever 2"n" − 1 is prime (Euclid, Prop. IX.36).
The fifth perfect number (formula_1) has 8 digits. This falsifies the first assumption. For the second assumption, the fifth perfect number indeed ends with a 6. However, the sixth (8 589 869 056) also ends in a 6. It is straightforward to show the last digit of any even perfect number must be 6 or 8.
In order for formula_2 to be prime, it is necessary that formula_3 should be prime. Prime numbers of the form 2"n" − 1 are known as Mersenne primes, after the seventeenth-century monk Marin Mersenne, who studied number theory and perfect numbers.
Two millennia after Euclid, Euler proved that the formula 2"n"−1(2"n" − 1) will yield all the even perfect numbers. Therefore, every Mersenne prime will yield a distinct even perfect number—there is a concrete one-to-one association between even perfect numbers and Mersenne primes. This result is often referred to as the "Euclid-Euler Theorem". In December 2006, only 44 Mersenne primes are known. This means there are 44 perfect numbers known, the largest being 232,582,656 × (232,582,657 − 1) with 19,616,714 digits.
The first 39 even perfect numbers are 2"n"−1(2"n" − 1) for
The other 5 known are for "n" = 20996011, 24036583, 25964951, 30402457, 32582657.
It is currently not known whether there are others between them.
It is still not known if there are infinitely many Mersenne primes and perfect numbers. The search for new Mersenne primes is the goal of the GIMPS distributed computing project.
Perfect numbers that are odd.
It is not known whether there are any odd perfect numbers. Various results have been obtained, but none that has helped to locate one or otherwise resolve the question of their existence. Carl Pomerance has presented a heuristic argument which suggests that no odd perfect numbers exist. Also, it has been conjectured that there are no odd Ore's harmonic numbers. If true, this would mean that there are no odd perfect numbers.

The sum of proper divisors gives various other kinds of numbers. Numbers where the sum is less than the number itself are called deficient, and where it is greater than the number, abundant. These terms, together with "perfect" itself, come from Greek numerology. A pair of numbers which are the sum of each other's proper divisors are called amicable, and larger cycles of numbers are called sociable. A positive integer such that every smaller positive integer is a sum of distinct divisors of it is a practical number.
By definition, a perfect number is a fixed point of the restricted sum-of-divisors function s(n) = σ(n) − n, and the aliquot sequence associated with a perfect number is a constant sequence.
