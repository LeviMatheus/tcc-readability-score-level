The Gräfenberg spot (usually called G-spot) is an area found behind the pubic bone of a woman. It is part of the urethal sponge. Some people believe it is a bundle of nerves in the female human reproductive system. If the area is stimulated, this can cause pleasurable sensations, female ejaculation and a strong orgasm in women. Doctors who specialise in the anatomy of women say there is no anatomical evidence for the "spot".
Origin.
The 'G-spot' was named by Addiego and others. in 1981. It is named after the German gynaecologist, Ernst Gräfenberg. Gräfenberg wrote first about "The Role of Urethra in Female Orgasm" in 1950. A book was first published about the G-spot in 1982, called "The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality" by three authors from the United States: Alice Kahn Ladas, a psychologist; Beverly Whipple, a registered nurse and sex counselor; and John D. Perry, a psychologist.
Location.
Women say that they have “deeper” orgasms when G-spots were stimulated.
Scientists also tried to experiment with the vagina by touching it in certain places under experimental conditions. They found that in most cases, women had G-spots near the front of the vagina.
Public views.
Some people, including doctors, don't believe that the G-spot exists. When the book "The G Spot and Other Recent Discoveries About Human Sexuality" was published in 1982, there was significant criticism. Some people who are not doctors simply say that it is a "highly sensitive area" in the vagina.
Scientific views.
Scientists have carried out tests trying to find the G-spot and have not found any evidence of it.
