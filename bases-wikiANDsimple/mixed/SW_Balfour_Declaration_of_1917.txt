The Balfour Declaration of 1917 was a policy by the government of Great Britain to discuss the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire after World War I. The declaration also said that Britain supported plans for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. And from the Palestinian (and Arabs) point of view this declaration often described as "The promise of he who doesn't own, to he who doesn't deserve", as Balfour doesn't have the right to determine the destination of Palestine, just like Jews don't have any rights in Palestine as a homeland.
