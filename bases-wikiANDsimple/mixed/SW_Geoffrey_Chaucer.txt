Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 – October 25, 1400) was an English writer, poet, and philosopher. He wrote the Canterbury Tales.
Chaucer was born in London. His father and grandfather sold wine in London. His name is French and means shoemaker. Chaucer became a noblewoman’s page. In 1360, he was captured by the French in the Hundred Years War. He was then ransomed and released.
Chaucer married Phillipa (de) Roet. She was a lady-in-waiting to the queen. He had about three or four children. Chaucer may have studied law in the "Inner Temple." He joined the Royal court and travelled a lot. In 1374, he became "Comptroller" (money supervisor) of the Customs for the Port of London. He did this job for 12 years.
Chaucer then moved to Kent. He may have started The Canterbury Tales in the 1380’s. He became a "Member of Parliament" in Kent in 1386. But his wife, Phillipa, died in 1387. On 12 July 1389, He became "Clerk of the Kings Works" (building supervisor). He stopped this job on 17 June 1391. He then started working as "deputy forester" in the Royal Forest. He may have stopped writing The Canterbury Tales soon after.
