The Borrowdale was a storeship in the First Fleet. The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. The "Borrowdale" was a ship of 275 tons under the command of Master R. Hobson. The ship had a contract with the British Government to transport food and and equipment. The owners were paid at a rate of 10 shillings per ton per month until the ship returned to Deptford.
The "Borrowdale" left Sydney in July, 1788. The crew became very sick with scurvy. When the ship got to Rio de Janeiro several sailors were taken to hospital. Five sailors died on the way back to England.
