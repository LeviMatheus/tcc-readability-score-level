Christine de Pizan (sometimes known as "de Pisan", 1365 – about 1420) was a writer. She lived during the medieval era. She challenged the male-dominated realm of the arts very strongly. De Pizan completed forty-one works. She is known as Europe’s first professional woman writer. She encouraged women to compete with men.
She lived in Venice from 1363-1434 but her influence carried all throughout Europe. It affected the social life for many Europeans because she gave confidence to women that they could rise beyond what men told them to do.
