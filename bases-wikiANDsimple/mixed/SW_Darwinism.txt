Darwinism is a term used to talk about different ideas connected to those Charles Darwin had about evolution. The meaning of "Darwinism" has changed over time, and depends on who is using the term.
The term was coined by Thomas Henry Huxley in April 1860. He used it to describe evolutionary concepts, including earlier concepts such as Malthusianism and Spencerism. In the late 19th century it came to mean the concept that natural selection was the only mechanism of evolution, in contrast to Lamarckism. Around 1900, Gregor Mendels work was rediscovered, "Darwinism" was the word used to classify the ideas. Today, both theroies have been unified.
As modern evolutionary theory has developed, the term has been associated at times with specific ideas.
