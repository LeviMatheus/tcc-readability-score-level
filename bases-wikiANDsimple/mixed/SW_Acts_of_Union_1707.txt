The Acts of Union were a pair of Parliamentary Acts passed in 1706 and 1707 by, respectively, the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland, to make effecrive the Treaty of Union which had been negotiated between the two countries. The Acts joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland which had been separate states before, with separate legislatures but with the same monarch into a single Kingdom of Great Britain.
The two countries had shared a monarch for about 100 years (since the "Union of the Crowns" in 1603, when James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne from his cousin, Queen Elizabeth I).
The Acts took effect on 1 May 1707.
