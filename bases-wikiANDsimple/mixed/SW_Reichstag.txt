The Reichstag building was designed as a home to the parliament of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894.
It was building used by the parliament of the German Empire until 1918. The parliament of the Weimar Republic, also called the Reichstag sat there until 1933, when it was burned down. The Third Reich had no parliament, so the building remained empty and derelict until after German reunification.
Then it became the seat of the German parliament again in 1999 after a reconstruction led by British architect Lord Norman Foster.
Today's parliament of Germany is called the "Bundestag." The "Reichstag" as a parliament dates back to the Holy Roman Empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of Nazi Germany (1933-1945). In today's usage, the German term "Reichstag" refers to the building, while the term "Bundestag" refers to the institution.
