Warp factor is a science fiction concept. It is mainly based in the "Star Trek" universe. Warp factor is a measurement of the speed of a spaceship. Warp factor 1 is equal to the speed of light. Star Trek spaceships can go as fast as warp factor 9.99. There have been a very small number of examples of Star Trek spaceships reaching warp factor 10 and over.
