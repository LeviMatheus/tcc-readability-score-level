In Egyptian mythology, Nut was the goddess of the sky. Her body made a protective layer over the Earth. Nut was the sister and wife of Geb, and the mother of Isis, Osiris, Nephthys and Seth.
The ancient Egyptians believed that Nut swallowed the sun-god, Ra, every night and gave birth to him every morning.
