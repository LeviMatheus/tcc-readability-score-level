Pelota in Spanish, pilota in Basque and Catalan, or pelote in French (from Latin "pila") is a name for several court sports played with a ball using one's hand, a racket, or a wooden bat ("pala"), against a wall ("frontón" in Spanish, "frontoi" in Basque, "frontó" in Catalan) or, more traditionally, with two teams face to face separated by a line on the ground or a net. Their roots can be traced to the Greek and other ancient cultures, but in Europe they all come from real tennis (see "Jeu de paume‎"). Today, Basque Pelota is widely played in several countries: in Spain and France, specially in the Basque Country and its neighbour areas.
