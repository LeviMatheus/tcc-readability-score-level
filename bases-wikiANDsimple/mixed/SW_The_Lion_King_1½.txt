"The Lion King 1½" (also known as "The Lion King 3: Hakuna Matata" in some countries) is the prequel to The Lion King made by The Walt Disney Company. The movie focuses on the characters Timon and Pumbaa before they met Simba. This feature was released on DVD and video on February 10, 2004.
The Story.
Timon and Pumbaa start to watch the original Lion King movie, but Timon keeps insisting to fast forward to when they come in, because they weren't seen in the beginning of the story or anywhere until halfway through. Pumbaa suggests telling the audience their story, which begins before Simba's journey begins. Through this, we meet Timon's mother and Uncle Max, discover why he left his meerkat colony, where he learned Hakuna Matata, how he meets Pumbaa, and the perils they encountered while searching for their dream home.
