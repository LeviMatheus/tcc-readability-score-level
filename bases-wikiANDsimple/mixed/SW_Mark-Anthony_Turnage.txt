Mark-Anthony Turnage (born Grays, Essex, 10 June 1960) is an English composer. He is one of the most original composers in his country today.
Turnage studied at the Royal College of Music and won all the major prizes. He became famous when he wrote an opera called "Greek". It is typical of his musical style: quite lyrical but also very dramatic and aggressive. His music is often inspired by jazz. Other works include "Kai", "Rockaby", "Blood on the Floor", "Dispelling the Fears", "Drowned Out" and "Three Screaming Popes". He has written music for the English National Opera, City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
