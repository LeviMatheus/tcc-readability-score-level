Bacon is a type of meat that comes from pigs. It is taken from the sides, back, or belly of the pig. It is often cut in thin slices, unlike other cured or smoked pork products. It is usually fried or grilled. It can also be microwaved. Canada has its own version of bacon called Canadian bacon.
Bacon contains high amounts of fat. Since bacon contains pork, eating it may be against the beliefs of certain religions. In some cultures, eating pork may be considered "unclean". Because of this, other varieties of bacon are also made out of turkey or chicken instead. Turkey bacon and chicken bacon usually contain half of the fat of pork based bacon.
