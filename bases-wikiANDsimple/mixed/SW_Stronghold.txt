Stronghold means castle or any other strongly fortified place.
The history of fortified buildings reaches from antiquity to modern times.
In medieval Europe, the castle was the most common type of stronghold and often the residence of the king or territorial lord. The Maginot Line is an example of a 20th century stronghold.
Stronghold is also the name of a small video game franchise consisting of several castle-sim games made by Firefly Studios.
