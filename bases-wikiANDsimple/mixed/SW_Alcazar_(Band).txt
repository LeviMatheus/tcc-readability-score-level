Alcazar is a Swedish pop group who had a string of hit singles during the early 2000s decade and are continuing successfully today.
Alcazar have twice taken part in the "Melodifestivalen", the competition that selects Sweden's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest. In 2003 "Not A Sinner, Nor A Saint" came third overall. But it became the biggest hit of all the songs in Melodifestivalen 2003 and won the National Finals Song Contest. It became Alcazar's first #1 single in Sweden and did sell gold. In 2005 "Alcastar" failed to qualify for the final automatically, but eventually made it through after a second chance semi-final. However, the group again had to settle for third in the final, which was won by Martin Stenmarck's song "Las Vegas". But the song became a hit and only needed three days in stores to became Alcazar's second #1 single in Sweden.
