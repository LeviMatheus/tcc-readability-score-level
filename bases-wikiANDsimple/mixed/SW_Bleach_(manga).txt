is an ongoing manga series authored by mangaka Tite Kubo. Since its debut in 2001, "Bleach" has been adapted into an anime series, two OVAs, three anime films, a rock musical, and numerous video games. Compilation volumes of the manga have sold over 39 million copies in Japan.
"Bleach" follows the lives of Ichigo Kurosaki, who is a high school student who can see ghosts. A "shinigami" (Soul Reaper or, literally, "death god") named Rukia Kuchiki, meets Ichigo while hunting an evil spirit known as a Hollow. Rukia is wounded during the fight with the spirit and cannot do anything except give her powers to Ichigo. That is how the adventures of Ichigo and Rukia begin. Together they search for Hollows and perform soul burials on souls, cleansing the spirits and sending them to Soul Society. The early parts of the story focus mostly on the characters and their pasts, instead actual job of the "shinigami". As events unfold, the story begins to go deeper into the world of the "shinigami" on the "other side" called Soul Society.
