Comics is short for "comic strips", usually a section in a newspaper. They can also be published in a magazine called a "comic book". The word "comic" simply means "funny", and can also refer to a person who tells jokes.
In comics, a story is told through different images, mostly in panels, following each other in order.
That means the first panel is supposed to be read first, and take place earlier in time than the panels following it.
In comics, speech is usually shown through word balloons.
There are many different kinds of word balloons, such as the "speech balloon", the "thought balloon" and the "scream balloon".
One difference between a comic and a simple cartoon is that a comic has many images,
while a cartoon only has one.
In Japan, comics are very popular. The Japanese word for comics is manga.
Manga can be either singular or plural, and can mean both the medium of comics, and a single comic example.
