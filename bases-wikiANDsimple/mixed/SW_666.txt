666 was a year in the western calendar, as counted Anno Domini.
The number 666 is also sometimes thought to be the number of Satan. There is no reason to think this found in the Bible, although it does mention in prophecy (Rev. 13:18) that this is "the number of the beast, for it is a human number." The author (John) is said to be dreaming of an evil beast (meaning a wild animal), and the dream is believed to mean something about the future. This is also a very significate number in several films, for example the Omen.
