Kronos (also Cronos or Cronus) is a Titan in Greek mythology. His parents are Gaia (the Earth) and Uranus. With his sister and wife Rhea his children are Demeter, Hades, Hera, Hestia, Poseidon, and Zeus. Kronos became so angry about his children's power he decided to eat them so he could obtain their power. He ate all but Zeus because Rhea hid baby Zeus and gave Kronos a rock instead. Later, when Zeus was grown, he poisoned Kronos and made him throw up his children. Now the reason they all survived in Kronos's stomach was because them being gods and goddesses, they were immortal. Zeus and his siblings were angry and Kronos was angry aswell, they started the great war among the Titans and the gods. No one was winning the war and no one was losing, so Zeus sought Rhea's help. Rhea suggested they free the other Titans, who Kronos locked away because they were too dangerous. The Titans were so happy to be freed from Tartarus, they helped Zeus win the war.
After the war against the Olympians Zeus stole Kronos's scythe and cut him in small pieces and spread him across Tartarus (the lowest place in the underworld) to dwell forever.
