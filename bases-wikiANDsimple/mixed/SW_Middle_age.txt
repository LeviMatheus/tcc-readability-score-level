The middle age is the period of life between young adult and before old age. There is no fixed age, but most people think it begins when someone is about 40 years old, until the person is 60 years old.
In most countries, people that think that by middle age, people should be mature, perhaps with a good, steady job and a family. It is also common for some adults to suffer from mid-life crisis, when they are unsure about their life and sometimes become depressed because of it.
Health.
Middle-aged people begin to look older, with more wrinkles in their skin, and start to have grey hair. They become less fit, less strong, and usually gain more weight.
Middle-aged females find it harder to become pregnant. If they do have a baby, there is a higher chance that it will have a genetic disease (Down's Syndrome, for example). Females usually have their menopause in middle age, when they stop menstruating every month. When that happens, they cannot have children anymore.
