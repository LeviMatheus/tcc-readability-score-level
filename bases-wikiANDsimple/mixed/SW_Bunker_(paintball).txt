In paintball, a bunker is an obstacle on the playing field used to block the view of opponents and prevent them from firing accurately. In woodsball, a bunker may be a fallen log, collection of wood debris, barrels, or other material. In most modern speedball tournaments, inflatable vinyl bunkers of different shapes and sizes are used.
