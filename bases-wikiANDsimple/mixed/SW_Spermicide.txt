Spermicide is a substance that kills sperm before it can enter the vagina. When a spermicide is used as the only form of contraception, the pregnancy rate is much higher than it is when other contraceptives are used. Spermicides are normally used with barrier contraception, such as condoms, cervical caps, diaphragms, and contraceptive sponges.
