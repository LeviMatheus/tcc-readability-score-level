Lincoln Davenport Chafee (born March 26, 1953) was a junior U.S. Senator from Rhode Island.
He was born in Providence, Rhode Island. Before he became Senator he was Mayor of Warwick (1993-1999). His father, John Chafee, was also a Senator from Rhode Island and member of the liberal wing of the Republican Party.
After his father was died in office Chafee was appointed to fill his vacancy. He was elected to his first full term in 2000.
He was probably the most liberal Republican Senator. He is strongly pro-choice, and supports gay rights and gun control. He was only Republican Senator in 2002 who voted against intervention in Iraq. In 2004 he didn't endorse the reelection bid of President George W. Bush, and urged other Republicans to write-in in the November election George H. W. Bush, not his son.
In January 2006 he was also the only Republican Senator to vote against Samuel Alito to the United States Supreme Court.
He was, however, defeated for reelection in 2006 by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse.
