In mathematics, more specifically in general topology and related branches, a net or Moore–Smith sequence is a generalization of the notion of a sequence. In essence, a sequence is a function whose domain is the natural numbers. The codomain of this function is usually some topological space. 
The motivation for generalizing the notion of a sequence is that, in the context of topology, sequences do not fully encode all information about functions between topological spaces. In particular, the following two conditions are, in general, not equivalent for a map "f" between topological spaces "X" and "Y":
While it is necessarily true that condition 1 implies condition 2, the reverse implication is not necessarily true if the topological spaces are not both first-countable. In particular, the two conditions are equivalent for metric spaces.
The concept of a net, first introduced by E. H. Moore and Herman L. Smith in 1922, is to generalize the notion of a sequence so that the above conditions (with "sequence" being replaced by "net" in condition 2) are in fact equivalent for all maps of topological spaces. In particular, rather than being defined on a countable linearly ordered set, a net is defined on an arbitrary directed set. This allows for theorems similar to the assertion that the conditions 1 and 2 above are equivalent to hold in the context of topological spaces that do not necessarily have a countable or linearly ordered neighbourhood basis around a point. Therefore, while sequences do not encode sufficient information about functions between topological spaces, nets do, because collections of open sets in topological spaces are much like directed sets in behaviour. The term "net" was coined by John L. Kelley.
Nets are one of the many tools used in topology to generalize certain concepts that may only be general enough in the context of metric spaces. A related notion, that of the filter, was developed in 1937 by Henri Cartan.
Definitions.
Any function whose domain is a directed set is called a where if this function takes values in some set formula_1 then it may also be referred to as a . Elements of a net's domain are called its . Explicitly, a is a function of the form formula_2 where formula_3 is some directed set. 
A is a non-empty set formula_3 together with a preorder, typically automatically assumed to be denoted by formula_5 (unless indicated otherwise), with the property that it is also () , which means that for any formula_6 there exists some formula_7 such that formula_8 and formula_9 
In words, this property means that given any two elements (of formula_3), there is always some element that is "above" both of them (i.e. that is greater than or equal to each of them); in this way, directed sets generalize the notion of "a direction" in a mathematically rigorous way. 
The natural numbers formula_11 together with the usual integer comparison formula_5 preorder form the archetypical example of a directed set. Indeed, a net whose domain is the natural numbers is a sequence because by definition, a sequence in formula_1 is just a function from formula_14 into formula_15 It is in this way that nets are generalizations of sequences. Importantly though, unlike the natural numbers, directed sets are required to be total orders or even partial orders. 
Moreover, directed sets are allowed to have greatest elements and/or maximal elements, which is the reason why when using nets, caution is advised when using the induced strict preorder formula_16 instead of the original (non-strict) preorder formula_17; in particular, if a directed set formula_18 has a greatest element formula_19 then there does exist any formula_20 such that formula_21 (in contrast, there exists some formula_20 such that formula_23). 
Nets are frequently denoted using notation that is similar to (and inspired by) that used with sequences. 
A net in formula_1 may be denoted by formula_25 where unless there is reason to think otherwise, it should automatically be assumed that the set formula_3 is a directed and that its associated preorder is denoted by formula_27 
However, notation for nets varies with some authors using, for instance, angled brackets formula_28 instead of parentheses. 
A net in formula_1 may also be written as formula_30 which expresses the fact that this net formula_31 is a function formula_32 whose value at an element formula_33 in its domain is denoted by formula_34 instead of the usual parentheses notation formula_35 that is typically used with functions (this subscript notation being taken from sequences). As in the field of algebraic topology, the filled disk or "bullet" denotes the location where arguments to the net (i.e. elements formula_19 of the net's domain) are placed; it helps emphasize that the net is a function and also reduces the number of indices and other symbols that must be written when referring to it later. 
Nets are primarily used in the fields of Analysis and Topology, where they are used to characterize many important topological properties that (in general), sequences are unable to characterize (this short coming of sequences motivated the study of sequential spaces and Fréchet–Urysohn spaces). Nets are intimately related to filters, which are also often used in Topology. Every net may be associated a filter and every filter may be associated with a net, where the properties of these associated objects are closed tied together (see the article about Filters in topology for more details). Nets directly generalize sequences and they may often used very similarly to sequences. Consequently, the learning curve for using nets is typically much less steep than that for filters, which is why many mathematicians, especially analysts, prefer them over filters. However, filters, and especially ultrafilters, have some important technical advantages over nets that ultimately results in nets being encountered much less often than filters outside of the fields of Analysis and Topology. 
A subnet is not merely the restriction of a net formula_37 to a directed subset of formula_38 see the linked page for a definition.
Examples of nets.
Every non-empty totally ordered set is directed. Therefore, every function on such a set is a net. In particular, the natural numbers with the usual order form such a set, and a sequence is a function on the natural numbers, so every sequence is a net.
Another important example is as follows. Given a point formula_39 in a topological space, let formula_40 denote the set of all neighbourhoods containing formula_41 Then formula_40 is a directed set, where the direction is given by reverse inclusion, so that formula_43 if and only if formula_44 is contained in formula_45 For formula_46 let formula_47 be a point in formula_48 Then formula_49 is a net. As formula_44 increases with respect to formula_51 the points formula_47 in the net are constrained to lie in decreasing neighbourhoods of formula_53 so intuitively speaking, we are led to the idea that formula_47 must tend towards formula_39 in some sense. We can make this limiting concept precise.
Limits of nets.
If formula_56 is a net from a directed set formula_3 into formula_58 and if formula_44 is a subset of formula_58 then formula_31 is said to be ' (or ') if there exists some formula_19 such that for every formula_20 with formula_64 the point formula_65 
A point formula_66 is called a or of the net formula_31 in formula_1 if (and only if) 
in which case, this net is then also said to and to . 
If the net formula_31 converges in formula_1 to a point formula_66 then this fact may be expressed by writing any of the following:
where if the topological space formula_1 is clear from context then the words "in formula_1" may be omitted. 
If formula_79 in formula_1 and if this limit in formula_1 is unique (uniqueness in formula_1 means that if formula_83 is such that formula_84 then necessarily formula_85) then this fact may be indicated by writing
where an equals sign is used in place of the arrow formula_89 In a Hausdorff space, every net has at most one limit so the limit of a convergent net in a Hausdorff space is always unique. 
Some authors instead use the notation "formula_86" to mean formula_79 with also requiring that the limit be unique; however, if this notation is defined in this way then the equals sign formula_92 is no longer guaranteed to denote a transitive relationship and so no longer denotes equality. Specifically, without the uniqueness requirement, if formula_93 are distinct and if each is also a limit of formula_31 in formula_1 then formula_86 and formula_97 could be written (using the equals sign formula_92) despite it being true that formula_99 
Intuitively, convergence of this net means that the values formula_34 come and stay as close as we want to formula_39 for large enough formula_102 
The example net given above on the neighborhood system of a point formula_39 does indeed converge to formula_39 according to this definition.
Given a subbase formula_105 for the topology on formula_1 (where note that every base for a topology is also a subbase) and given a point formula_107 a net formula_31 in formula_1 converges to formula_39 if and only if it is eventually in every neighborhood formula_111 of formula_41 This characterization extends to neighborhood subbases (and so also neighborhood bases) of the given point formula_41 
If the set formula_114 is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_58 then formula_79 in formula_1 if and only if formula_79 in formula_48 In this way, the question of whether or not the net formula_31 converges to the given point formula_39 is depends on this topological subspace formula_44 consisting of formula_39 and the image of (i.e. the points of) the net formula_124 
Limits in a Cartesian product.
A net in the product space has a limit if and only if each projection has a limit. 
Symbolically, suppose that the Cartesian product 
of the spaces formula_126 is endowed with the product topology and that for every index formula_127 the canonical projection to formula_128 is denoted by 
Let formula_131 be a net in formula_132 directed by formula_3 and for every index formula_127 let 
denote the result of "plugging formula_136 into formula_137", which results in the net formula_138 
It is sometimes useful to think of this definition in terms of function composition: the net formula_139 is equal to the composition of the net formula_140 with the projection formula_141; that is, formula_142 
If given formula_143 then 
If no formula_149 is given but for every formula_127 there exists some formula_151 such that formula_152 in formula_128 then the tuple defined by formula_154 will be a limit of formula_136 in formula_15 
However, the axiom of choice might be need to be assumed in order to conclude that this tuple formula_157 exists; the axiom of choice is not needed in some situations, such as when formula_158 is finite or when every formula_151 is the limit of the net formula_139 (because then there is nothing to choose between), which happens for example, when every formula_128 is a Hausdorff space. If formula_158 is infinite and formula_163 is not empty, then the axiom of choice would (in general) still be needed to conclude that the projections formula_164 are surjective maps. 
The axiom of choice is equivalent to Tychonoff's theorem, which states that the product of any collection of compact topological spaces is compact. 
But if every compact space is also Hausdorff, then the so called "Tychonoff's theorem for compact Hausdorff spaces" can be used instead, which is equivalent to the ultrafilter lemma and so strictly weaker than the axiom of choice. 
Nets can be used to give short proofs of both version of Tychonoff's theorem by using the characterization of net convergence given above together with the fact that a space is compact if and only if every every net has a convergent subnet.
Ultranets and cluster points of a net.
Let formula_37 be a net in formula_1 based on the directed set formula_3 and let formula_44 be a subset of formula_58 then formula_37 is said to be (or ) formula_44 if for every formula_19 there exists some formula_173 such that formula_174 and formula_175
A point formula_66 is said to be an or of a net if (and only if) for every neighborhood formula_69 of formula_53 the net is frequently in formula_179
A net formula_37 in set formula_1 is called or an if for every subset formula_182 formula_37 is eventually in formula_44 or formula_37 is eventually in formula_186 Ultranets are closely related to ultrafilters.
Examples.
Sequence in a topological space.
A sequence formula_187 in a topological space formula_1 can be considered a net in formula_1 defined on formula_190 
The net is eventually in a subset formula_44 of formula_1 if there exists an formula_193 such that for every integer formula_194 the point formula_195 is in formula_48 
So formula_197 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_199 the net is eventually in formula_200
The net is frequently in a subset formula_44 of formula_1 if and only if for every formula_193 there exists some integer formula_204 such that formula_205 that is, if and only if infinitely many elements of the sequence are in formula_48 Thus a point formula_83 is a cluster point of the net if and only if every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_209 contains infinitely many elements of the sequence.
Function from a metric space to a topological space.
Consider a function from a metric space formula_210 to a topological space formula_58 and a point formula_212 We direct the set formula_213reversely according to distance from formula_214 that is, the relation is "has at least the same distance to formula_215 as", so that "large enough" with respect to the relation means "close enough to formula_215". The function formula_37 is a net in formula_1 defined on formula_219
The net formula_37 is eventually in a subset formula_44 of formula_1 if there exists some formula_223 such that for every formula_224 with formula_225 the point formula_226 is in formula_48
So formula_228 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_199 formula_37 is eventually in formula_200
The net formula_37 is frequently in a subset formula_44 of formula_1 if and only if for every formula_236 there exists some formula_224 with formula_225 such that formula_226 is in formula_48
A point formula_83 is a cluster point of the net formula_37 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_244 the net is frequently in formula_200
Function from a well-ordered set to a topological space.
Consider a well-ordered set formula_246 with limit point formula_247 and a function formula_37 from formula_249 to a topological space formula_15 This function is a net on formula_251
It is eventually in a subset formula_198 of formula_1 if there exists an formula_254 such that for every formula_255 the point formula_256 is in formula_200
So formula_258 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_199 formula_37 is eventually in formula_200
The net formula_37 is frequently in a subset formula_198 of formula_1 if and only if for every formula_254 there exists some formula_255 such that formula_268
A point formula_83 is a cluster point of the net formula_37 if and only if for every neighborhood formula_198 of formula_244 the net is frequently in formula_200
The first example is a special case of this with formula_274

Properties.
Virtually all concepts of topology can be rephrased in the language of nets and limits. This may be useful to guide the intuition since the notion of limit of a net is very similar to that of limit of a sequence. The following set of theorems and lemmas help cement that similarity:
Cauchy nets.
A generalizes the notion of Cauchy sequence to nets defined on uniform spaces.
A net formula_56 is a Cauchy net if for every entourage "V" there exists formula_7 such that for all formula_312 formula_313 is a member of "V". More generally, in a Cauchy space, a net formula_31 is Cauchy if the filter generated by the net is a Cauchy filter.
Relation to filters.
A filter is another idea in topology that allows for a general definition for convergence in general topological spaces. The two ideas are equivalent in the sense that they give the same concept of convergence. More specifically, for every filter base an can be constructed, and convergence of the filter base implies convergence of the associated net—and the other way around (for every net there is a filter base, and convergence of the net implies convergence of the filter base). For instance, any net formula_315 in formula_1 induces a filter base of tails formula_317 where the filter in formula_1 generated by this filter base is called the net's . This correspondence allows for any theorem that can be proven with one concept to be proven with the other. For instance, continuity of a function from one topological space to the other can be characterized either by the convergence of a net in the domain implying the convergence of the corresponding net in the codomain, or by the same statement with filter bases.
Robert G. Bartle argues that despite their equivalence, it is useful to have both concepts. He argues that nets are enough like sequences to make natural proofs and definitions in analogy to sequences, especially ones using sequential elements, such as is common in analysis, while filters are most useful in algebraic topology. In any case, he shows how the two can be used in combination to prove various theorems in general topology.
Limit superior.
Limit superior and limit inferior of a net of real numbers can be defined in a similar manner as for sequences. Some authors work even with more general structures than the real line, like complete lattices.
For a net formula_25 put
Limit superior of a net of real numbers has many properties analogous to the case of sequences. For example,
where equality holds whenever one of the nets is convergent.
