"One Night Only" is a song from the 1981 Broadway musical "Dreamgirls", with lyrics by Tom Eyen and music by Henry Krieger. In the context of the musical, "One Night Only" is performed twice in succession, as differing versions of the song - a soul ballad by the character Effie White and a disco version by her former bandmates Deena Jones & the Dreams - compete on the radio and the pop charts.
