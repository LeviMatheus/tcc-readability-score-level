Player Killing (PKing) is a part of online gaming with real people. It is when you kill another person's character. Some other terms in pking are: PJing which means pile jumping, or attacking someone when they are picking up the items dropped by a player they have just Player Killed, Safer, which means someone who PKs safely (especially when eating or healing) and doesn't take risks, making it unfair on the people trying to PK them and DD which means death dot, when people in a Player Killing team all stand underneath each other, making it appear to other players that there is only one person there. however, "safing" varies in how other people percept it. it can be used to stay alive, however you usually lose a chance to hit when healing.
