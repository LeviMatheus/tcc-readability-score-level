Novaja Zemlja is a group of two islands (an archipelago). The islands are in the Arctic Ocean. They are part of the European part of Russia. The group is made of a north island and a south island; it separates the Barents sea from the Kara sea. There is a narrow channel, called Matochkin Strait that separates the two islands. Both islands together are about 900 km long; they are between 470 and 1150 km north of the arctic circle. Today, 2716 people live on the islands. 2622 of them live in the capital "Belushya Guba" (on the south island)
There are military installations on the islands; nuclear tests were done; especially on the north island. Around the islands, there are various old (nuclear) submarines and other nuclear waste. Part of the north island is still off-limits for civilians.
