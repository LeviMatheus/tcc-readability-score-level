Dreams are the things that happen in a person's mind while they are sleeping. Dreams can seem so real while they happen that the person might think that they are awake. If they do know they are asleep, this is called a lucid dream. This happens very little for most people, but for some people it happens often. During lucid dreaming people can have fun and do things that are not possible in real life. Most people do not remember their dreams unless they wake up in the middle of the dream. Many dreams involve things that could not happen in real life. They can be pleasant, strange, sad, or scary. Nightmares are dreams which scare people. When people have nightmares, they often wake up in the middle of the night.
There are many different theories about why people dream about what they dream about. Every person has different dreams. Some psychologists believe that dreams reflect what the unconscious mind (the part of the mind people are not aware of) is thinking about. Others think that people, places, and objects in dreams are symbols for other things. There are many books and websites devoted to making sense of dreams.
