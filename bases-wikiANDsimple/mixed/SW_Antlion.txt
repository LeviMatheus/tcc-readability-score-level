Antlion are a family of insects in the order Neuroptera with the scientific name Myrmeleontidae (sometimes misspelled as "Myrmeleonidae") most well-known genus is "Myrmeleo". There are about 2,000 species.
Description.
Most people know this insect because of the funnel-shaped pit, up to 2 inches in diameter and depth, produced by the larval stages of this insect to trap ants. Larvae have globular abdomens and narrower, flattened heads bearing sickle-shaped jaws. Adults superficially resemble drab-colored, 1 Â½ inch long damselflies with four long, narrow, net-veined wings roof-like held over a long, skinny abdomen when at rest. Unlike damselflies, however, ant-lion antennae are prominent and clubbed at the end.
