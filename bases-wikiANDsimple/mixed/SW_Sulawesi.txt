Sulawesi (formerly known as Celebes, is one of the four larger Sunda Islands of Indonesia and is situated between Borneo and the Maluku Islands.
Geography.
Sulawesi is the world's eleventh-largest island, covering an area of 174,600 kmÂ². The island is surrounded by Borneo to the west, by the Philippines to the north, by Maluku to the east, and by Flores and Timor to the south. It has a distinctive shape, dominated by four large peninsulas: the Semenanjung Minahassa; the East Peninsula; the South Peninsula; and the South-east Peninsula. The central part of the island is ruggedly mountainous, such that the island's peninsulas have traditionally been remote from each other, with better connections by sea than by road.
