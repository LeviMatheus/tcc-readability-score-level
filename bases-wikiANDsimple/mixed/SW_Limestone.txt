Limestone is a chemical sedimentary rock, made up mostly of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate: CaCO3). When it is heated at a very high temperature, it becomes the metamorphic rock, marble.
Uses.
Limestones are easy to work with, so they are used for building architecture. Limestone became most popular in the 19th and 20th centuries for building things such as churches, banks and houses. It is used to make glass and cement. It can be used like chalk, as it is mostly calcium, so you can actually draw with the stone. People use it as decorations sometimes, as pebbles.
