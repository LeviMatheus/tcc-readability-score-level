The liger is a mixed animal that has a lion father and a tiger mother. They are the largest cat taxon (kind of cat). Most weigh about 700 pounds, while others can weigh as much as 1,000 pounds. Their growth continues until they die.
These animals are like both lions and tigers. Some may have a moderate mane, but most don't.
Tigons are also mixed animals with one lion parent and one tiger parent. Tigons have tiger fathers and lion mothers. They are smaller than ligers. Their hair is also different.
