Damageplan was a heavy metal band from Dallas, Texas. They started playing in 2003 after Pantera's guitarist and drummer decided to start a new band. They only released one album, because in 2004, the guitarist "Dimebag Darrell Abbott" was shot during a concert. After this incident the band dissolved.
