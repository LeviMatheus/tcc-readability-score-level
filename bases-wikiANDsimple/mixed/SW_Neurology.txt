Neurology is the study of the nervous system in medicine. Neurology also is about the diagnosis and treatment of conditions and illnesses of the nervous system. This can include both the physical condition of the brain, nerves, and brain messages between the body and the nervous system. When things are not functioning normally, the differences can influence behaviour, function and/or sensation.
