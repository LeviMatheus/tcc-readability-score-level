Suikoden is a series of role playing video games made by Japanese company Konami. There have been five main Suikoden games made. Suikoden 1 and 2 were released on the first Playstation. Suikoden 3, 4, and 5 were released on the Playstation 2. In each game the player would play the role of a hero who must free his country from either from a foreign invader or an evil government within his own country. To do this he would recruit the 108 "stars of destiny" to help him and raise an army. Unlike Final Fantasy games, every Suikoden game is set in the same world but in different countries.
