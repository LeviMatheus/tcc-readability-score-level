In the fictional universes of Warhammer 40,000 and Warhammer Fantasy, Nurgle is one of the four major Chaos gods. Like his brother gods, Nurgle grew from a single survivalist emotion: in his case, the emotion was despair. Nurgle is the Chaos god of disease, decay, despair and destruction. Even though the nature of his influence, he begins to like his victims, caring for them in a jovial manner close to a loving grandfather; so he is commonly called "Grandfather Nurgle" or "Papa Nurgle". He is also called the "Lord of Decay", "Master of Plague and Pestilence" and "Lord of All". He is shown as a huge, bloated humanoid, with boils and sores, his body completely rotten from disease. He is usually with an enveloping cloud of buzzing flies.
