NTFS is a file system. It was developed by Microsoft. A file-system is a way of storing computer files. NTFS stands for "New Technology File System". Microsoft introduced it with the Windows NT operating system. A version of NTFS is also included in the most recent operating systems developed by Microsoft, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista.
NTFS was made to replace the old file-system used by earlier versions of Windows, like Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows 98SE. That file system was also used by MS-DOS and is called FAT.
