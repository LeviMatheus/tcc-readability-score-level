Seafloor spreading is a type of geographic movement that happens on the bottom of an ocean. It happens at ridges in the middle of oceans where new oceanic crust is created. This crust is created by volcanic activity. The new crust then slowly moves away from the ridge. Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics.
Earlier theories (e.g., by Alfred Wegener) of continental drift were that continents "plowed" through the ocean. The idea that the ocean floor itself moves and carries the continents with it as it expands from a central axis was created by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s. Today, many people believe this theory is true. The phenomenon is known to be caused by convection currents in the very weak upper mantle, or asthenosphere.
