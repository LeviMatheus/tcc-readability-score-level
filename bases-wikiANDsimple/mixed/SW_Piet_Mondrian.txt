Piet Mondrian, born in Holland in 1872, painted traditional subjects in an increasingly abstract style. By 1920, he adopts a totally abstract motif, employing an irregular checkerboard drawn with black lines, and with the spaces paints mostly white or sometimes in the primary colors of blue, red and yellow.
This is typical of about 250 abstract paintings dating from 1917 to 1944. Mondrian named his style “neoplasticism,” his translation of his own Dutch phrase nieuwe beelding, which also means “new form” or “new image.”
Escaping in 1940 from a Europe at war, Mondrian spends the last four years of his life in New York City, where he is fascinated by the exuberance of its city life. His paintings of that time express that exuberance. In his final painting, Broadway Boogie Woogie (1942-1943), below, the checkerboard lines, previously black, are now painted blue, gray, red and yellow. (The yellow was apparently inspired by New York’s Yellow cabs).
