The polar bear ("Ursus maritimus") is a large bear that lives in the Arctic. It is also called white bear or northern bear. They are slowly becoming extinct due to global warming, because there is less ice. So when the Polar Bears swim, they are unable to rest, and drown.
Appearance.
Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually translucent. The fur keeps them warm. They are strong and can swim very well. Polar bears are similar in size to a normal bear but have a slimmer neck, longer legs and fur.
Life.
They are mostly carnivorous. They eat mostly seals and fish. When Polar bears hunt, they often wait at holes in the ice, where the seals come up to breathe.
Polar bears live alone. Young Polar bears stay with their mothers for 1.5–2.5 years, and they become mature when they are 5–6 years old. People think Polar bears can become 25–30 years old in nature, but in captivity (for example in zoos) they can become up to 45 years old.
Mating.
Polar bears mate in April or May. The cub is born in December, when the mother is hibernating. The cub stays in the den with the mother until March, then they all come out. They have to eat immediately after hibernating. Sometimes, because of global warming this is impossible and the cubs die before they have had a chance to live. The cub leaves its mother in 2–3 years.
