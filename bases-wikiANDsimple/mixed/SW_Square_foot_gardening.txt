Square Foot Gardening.
Square Foot Gardening is a type of gardening popularized by Mel Bartholemew. It is based on the idea that the wide rows in traditional home gardening are a waste of time, work, water and space, and that more quality vegetables can be grown in less space with less effort.
In this method, the garden space is divided into beds (a 4' x 4', 16 sq ft or 120cm x 120cm, 1.4mÂ² garden being recommended) and separated by paths. These beds are further divided into squares of approximately one square foot, and planted with your vegetables. Common spacing is one plant/square for larger plants such as broccoli, basil, etc.. four/square for medium large plants like lettuce, nine/square for medium -small plants like spinach, and sixteen/square for small plants such as onions and carrots. Other plant spacings can be found in the "in row spacing" on seed packets. The beds are weeded and watered from the pathways, so the garden soil is not compacted.
