Group theory is an advanced subject in mathematics. It is the study of mathematical objects called groups. It is very important in many areas of science, especially chemistry and physics.
Groups.
An important idea about a group is that when two elements are combined using the operation, the order of the elements matters. Switching the order of two combined elements gives a different result, except in special cases.
