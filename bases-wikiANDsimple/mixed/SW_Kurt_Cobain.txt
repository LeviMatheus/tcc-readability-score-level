Kurt Donald Cobain (February 20, 1967 - April 5, 1994) was the lead singer and guitarist of the grunge band Nirvana, which also included bassist Krist Novoselic and drummer Dave Grohl.
Cobain was very influential in popularizing what came to be known as grunge music - a style of rock music that formed in part as a reaction against what people saw as the shallow nature of 1980s stadium rock and over-the-top metal bands (hair metal) with preened images and elaborate stage shows. Nirvana's best known song is "Smells Like Teen Spirit", which was often referred to by the media as an anthem for Generation X and grunge itself. Among other well known Cobain songs are "Lithium", "In Bloom", "Come as You Are", "Heart-Shaped Box", "All Apologies", and the highly controversial "Rape Me".
Cobain suffered a drug addiction that started when he was a teenager. He was a persistent user of cocaine and heroin. Later in his career, he was admitted into rehab several times. On his final visit to a rehab centre, he jumped a wall and escaped to his home. His death was ruled a suicide in 1994. But there is a lot of talk and debate about it.
