In astrophysics, a white hole is the opposite of a black hole. Where a black hole attracts and sucks in any nearby matter, a white hole does the opposite and pushes nearby matter away. A theory about white holes is that they act as an exit for matter sucked in by a black hole, suggesting that black holes are a type of teleporter (something that can transport objects instantly without travelling through space). The black and white holes are connected by a wormhole (see diagram).
