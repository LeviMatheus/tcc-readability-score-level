is a 2002 video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo GameCube. It was the first platform game starring Mario that was not a launch title â€“ it not released when the Nintendo console debuted. Instead, it was released about nine months after the GameCube had come out. The other release of the other three consoles (NES, SNES, and Nintendo 64) had been accompanied by a "Mario" game.
Plot.
In this game, Mario and his friends have landed in Delfino Isle for a vacation. However, the people on the island imprison Mario. Someone who looks like Mario has been making the island dirty. A judge tells Mario to clean up the island. He is given a device called FLUDD, which Mario straps on his back. FLUDD is a powerful water device that can clean up the mess that the fake Mario has caused.
Eventually, Mario learns that Bowser Jr., the son of Bowser, was the one who was dirtying the island. Bowser Jr. thinks that Princess Peach is his mother and kidnaps her. Mario must rescue her.
Gameplay.
Like "Super Mario 64", there are many worlds and each world has several goals to meet. Instead of stars, Mario captures shrines that will help restore the island. Each world has a boss to defeat. As Mario clears each world, he unlocks others.
Mario must clean up acres and acres of sludge and flith that is on the island. FLUDD allows him to do this. FLUDD only has a small quantity of water and Mario must jump into a pool of water after the water runs out. FLUDD also has several other things it can do. If Mario aims the nozzles down, Mario can float for a few seconds until the water runs out.
There are also areas where Mario takes FLUDD off and jumps around himself without assistance. The first time he goes he has to go through the area with no assistance. The second time he goes, he has to collect eight red coins in a time limit.
The normal default nozzle and hover nozzle, the rocket nozzle, and the prop. nozzle.
