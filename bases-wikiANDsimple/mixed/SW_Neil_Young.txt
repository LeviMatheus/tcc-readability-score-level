Neil Percival Young (born November 12, 1945) is a Canadian musician. He is known for his country and rock songs. Sometimes people call him the Godfather of Grunge because the style of some of his songs led to the kind of music called grunge music that started to be popular in the early 1990s. Many of his songs have a political and/or personal message. He was also a member of the groups Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
Some of his best-known songs are "Heart of Gold", "Helpless", "After the Gold Rush", "Rockin' in the Free World", "Cinnamon Girl", "Southern Man" and "Like a Hurricane".
Young has explored many different styles of music during his career, and not all his records have been popular. During the 1980s, he was sued by his record company, Reprise Records, who believed he was purposely making records that would not sell. Young won out over Reprise in court.
