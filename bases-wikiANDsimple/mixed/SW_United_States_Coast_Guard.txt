The United States Coast Guard is one of the 5 branches of the military of the United States. It is a part of the United States Department of Homeland Security.
The Coast Guard's purpose is to protect the people, environment, industry and security of the United States on seas, lakes and rivers. To do this, the Coast Guard uses boats, ships, helicopters and airplanes to stop crime and terrorism, and to rescue ships and boats in danger.
The modern United States Coast Guard was started on January 28, 1915 when the U. S. Congress ordered the Revenue Cutter Service and the Life-Saving Service to be put together. The Coast Guard can become part of the Department of the Navy during war, but it is not now.
