Physical compression means that a material under compressive stress reduces its volume.
There are different uses of compression in physics and engineering.
By compression it is possible to measure mechanical properties of materiels such as compressive strength or modulus of elasticity. Scientists may do this with press machines.
Compression is also used in engines, for example in the Diesel engine as in any internal combustion engine and in the steam engine.
