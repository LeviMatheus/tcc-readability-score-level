The planet earth is covered with seas. In those seas there are the continents: Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, South America and Antarctica.
Every continent is put into the sea, like an island. Most of the island is above the water line, and we see it as a continent. Some of it though, is below the water line. It is like a shallow ocean. This is called the continental shelf.
