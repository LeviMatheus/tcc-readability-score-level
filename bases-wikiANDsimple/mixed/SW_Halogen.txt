The halogens are chemical elements under the second-to-right column in the periodic table, also known as Group 7. The elements in the group are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine. They are very reactive, so they are likely to join with other elements on the left side of the periodic table to make compounds. This is due to the fact that they are missing one electron. They are rarely found alone in nature, except astatine, which is not found in nature.
