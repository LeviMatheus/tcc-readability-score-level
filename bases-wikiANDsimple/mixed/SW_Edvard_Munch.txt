Famous paintings.
"The Scream" (1893; originally called "Despair"). This is Munch's best-known painting, and is one of the best known images in the world. It is one of the pieces in a series titled "The Frieze of Life". In the series Munch explored the themes of life, love, fear, death and melancholy. As with many of his works, he made several versions of the painting. One version was stolen from the "Munch-museum" in Oslo, Norway, on August 22, 2004, but on August 31, 2006 Norwegian police found it together with another picture that was stolen at the same time, "Madonna".
"The Frieze of Life" themes come back throughout Munch's work. These themes can be seen in paintings such as "The Sick Child" (1886, portrait of his deceased sister Sophie), (1893–94), "Ashes" (1894), and "The Bridge". The last-named shows limp figures. Those figures have faces witth no features, or they have no faces at all. Threatening shapes of heavy trees and houses are above the figurss. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers or as lurid, life-devouring vampires. Munch analysts say this reflects his sexual anxieties.
