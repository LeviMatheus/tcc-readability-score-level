The concept of Hell in Christianity comes from Genesis and the "casting out" of Lucifer. In being cast out, he was removed from the presence of God. Therefore, if taken in it's most literal sense, Hell, in Christianity, is separation from God. Stated another way, to the Christian mind being separated from God is to be in Hell.
