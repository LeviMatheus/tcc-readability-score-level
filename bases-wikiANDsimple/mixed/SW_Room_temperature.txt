Room temperature is "not" a precisely defined scientific term. It means a temperature that is common in rooms used by human beings.
Human comfort and health.
For human comfort, desirable room temperature greatly depends on individual needs and various other factors. According to the West Midlands Public Health Observatory (UK), 21 °C (70 °F) is the recommended living room temperature, whereas 18 °C (64 °F) for bedroom temperature. '.
Scientific calculations.
For scientific calculations, room temperature is taken to be about 20 to 25 degrees Celsius with an average of 23 °C (About 72.5 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), 528 to 537 degrees Rankine (°R), or 293 to 298 kelvins (K)). For numerical convenience, either 20 °C or 300 K is often used.
Condition for physical experiments.
The progress and results of many scientific and industrial processes depends a little or not at all on the temperature of the surroundings of the equipment. For example, a measurement of the charge of the electron does not depend upon the temperature of the test equipment. In such cases if any mention of temperature is made, it is customary and sufficient to speak simply of "room temperature", which essentially implies simply that what is being spoken of has not been specifically heated or cooled. Usually this means a temperature at which many people are comfortable, around 20 °C.
