Heresy is a word used by different churches, It is used to describe someone, who has ideas that are different or the opposite from what the church officially says about what they believe in. Such a person is known as "heretic". In medieval times, one of the punishments for heresy was burning at the stake.
Especially in the Middle Ages it was common to accuse someone of heresy. If the accusations could be proven, the culprit would go through a ritual. Since torture could be used to get a confession, the accusations were proven very often. The ritual was done to save the soul of the convicted criminal. It involved being burnt at the stake.
In the Middle Ages, male heretics used to be called "warlock", female heretics used to be called "witch".
