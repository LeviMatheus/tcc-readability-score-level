The Phalangids (name rarely used), or Opiliones, or Harvestmen are eight-legged invertebrates. They belong to the order "Opiliones". They are Arachnids ("Arachnida"). As of 2006, over 6,400 species of harvestmen have been discovered worldwide, although the real number of extant species may exceed 10,000. The order Opiliones can be divided in four suborders: Cyphophthalmi (Simon, 1879), Eupnoi (Hansen & Sørensen, 1904), Dyspnoi (Hansen & Sørensen, 1904) and Laniatores (Thorell, 1876). Well-preserved fossils have been found in the 400-million year old Rhynie cherts of Scotland. The samples found look surprisingly modern. This may indicate that the basic structure of the harvestmen has not changed much since then. The Phylogenetic position is disputed: their closest relatives may be the mites (Acari) or the Novogenuata (the Scorpiones, Pseudoscorpiones and Solifugae).
Although they belong to the class of arachnids, harvestmen are not spiders. Spiders belong to the order Araneae rather than the order Opiliones.
In some places, harvestmen are known by the name "daddy longlegs" or "granddaddy longlegs", but this name is also used for two other unrelated arthropods: the crane fly ("Tipulidae") and the cellar spider ("Pholcidae").
Many species are omnivores, they eat anything they can find. Most of the time this is small insects, and some plants and fungi. Some are scavengers.
Phalangids are not dangerous to humans. None of the described species has poison glands. Phalangids are not "true" spiders even though they look like true spiders in many ways. For example, Phalangids have no venom or silk glands; true spiders have these.
