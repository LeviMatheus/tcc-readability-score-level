Romanization or "Latinization" is the process by which words and languages that normally use alphabets other than the Latin alphabet are converted into Latin letters so that people who do not know the original alphabet can still read the sounds of the language. It is one way to show pronunciation of words from a non-Latin writing system.
Transcription.
Transcription occurs when the effect at the end is that both the original and the transcripted version sound the same, whether or not each letter alone in one text matches the corresponding letter in the other one.
Transliteration.
Transliteration occurs when the effect at the end is for the letters to match one to one, whether or not the sound is the same.
