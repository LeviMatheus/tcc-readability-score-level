A paramedic is a person who works outside a hospital and goes to help at an emergency. Paramedics usually get to an emergency in an ambulance. Paramedics usually work in a team of three or four and they work together to help a hurt person quickly and sometimes take them to a nearby hospital. In many cases, they are also firefighters and work from fire engines.
In some countries like the United States of America and the United Kingdom, it is against the law for people to say they are paramedics unless they have special training and have passed some tests.
