Derry or Londonderry is a city in Northern Ireland near to the border with the Republic of Ireland.
It was originally called Doire (pronounced "duhruh") which is an Irish word for a group of oak trees. In English, this word became "Derry". When the city became bigger, six companies from London in England paid a lot of money to build things. The city was renamed "Londonderry", although some people take issue with this.
In 1984 the city council changed the name of the local government area back to its original title of Derry. But the City's official title is still Londonderry.
People from the Republic of Ireland call the city "Derry".
