The Duchy of Saxe-Jena was one of the Ernestine duchies of the House of Wettin.
Part of the Duchy of Saxe-Weimar was given to Bernhard, the fourth son of Wilhelm, Duke of Saxe-Weimar in 1672. The second duke had no male heirs to inherit the title, so the territory was taken back by Saxe-Weimar when the second duke died in 1690..
