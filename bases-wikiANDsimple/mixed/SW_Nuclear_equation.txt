A nuclear equation or reaction equation is commonly used in particle physics to show radioactive decay processes. It is similar in function to chemical equations used in chemistry. It has a nuclide on the left then a right-pointing arrow and then the products of the decay on the right. The equation must be balanced follow the conservation laws of quantum mechanics for nuclear transformations. Certain things are not changed by decay. Thses are called "conserved entities". The conserved entities are total energy (including mass), number of nucleons, linear and angular momentum, and lepton number. The particles or nuclei in the equation are written with a superscript to show mass number 'A' and a subscript to denote atomic number 'Z.'
