Weymouth is a resort town in Dorset on the south coast of England. 52,000 people live in the town. Thousands of tourists have holidays there, because it is by the sea. In summer it is sunny and warm and there's lots to do. The sailing in the 2012 Olympics will be held in Weymouth and on the Isle of Portland nearby.
