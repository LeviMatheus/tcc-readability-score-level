The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 is the name for a series of protests that occured in April and June of that year. China refers to them as the June Fourth Incident. There were other protests on Tianamem square in 1919 and 1976. The protests of 1989 were organised by different groups of students, intellectuals and labour activists. There was no common cause or leadership in the protests; most protesters did not like the way the Communist party of China ran the economy, though. Most people protested on Tianmen Square in Peking, but some also did in other cities, like Shanghai. The protests in cities other than Beijing stayed peaceful though.
On June 4, the government forcefully dissolved the protests. This left many people injured or dead. The exact number is not known today, different people have different numbers. The Chinese government speaks about 200-300 victims, the New York Times says there were between 300 and 800 and the Chinese Red Cross talks about 2,000 - 3,000.
The official Chinese position on the events was that the protests needed to be dispersed in order not to harm the stability of the country.
Many of the scenes were shown around the world over western media.
