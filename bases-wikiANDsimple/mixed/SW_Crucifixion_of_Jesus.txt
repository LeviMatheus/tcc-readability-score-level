The crucifixion of Jesus is an event recorded in all four gospels which takes place after his arrest and trial. It includes his scourging, crucifixion on the cross, and burial. In Christian theology, the death of Jesus by crucifixion is a core event on which much teaching depends, representing a critical aspect of the doctrine of salvation.
Christians believe that Jesus was God in human form. Since he was God, he could not die. After he died on the Cross on Friday, he went down to Hell to free souls of those who had died before Jesus' coming. On Sunday, Christians believe that Jesus came back to life and left the tomb (the place where he was buried).
The crucifixion is necessary to Christianity. Christians believe that Jesus suffered very much on the cross as a way of paying for all of mankind's sins (sins = bad actions, thoughts, deeds, etc). By taking on all of this suffering, mankind was freed from the punishment that God should have given to man (because of man's weakness and bad choices in life).
The crucifixion itself is a sad event as Jesus had to suffer horribly. His friends and his own mother had to witness it. However, this was necessary for him to come back to life and to show that death has no power over him. Through the crucifixion, Christians believe that God has set us free and shown to the world that Jesus is God and that life is forever. Jesus sacrificed himself for all of mankind to show his love.
A "passion play" is a play that tells this story of Jesus' trial and then his crucifixion. A recent version, "The Passion", was produced and released by Mel Gibson. It was and still is very popular with Christians and non-Christians alike.
