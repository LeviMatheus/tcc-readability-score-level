Sofiensaal (or Sofiensäle) is the name of a former public bath and concert venue in Vienna. It was built as a public bath in the years 1845-1848 by Eduard van der Nüll and August Sicard von Sicardsburg. It was used as a bath in winter. During the summer, the swimming pool was covered with wooden planks. The venue could then be used for concerts, and as a dance venue. In March 1912 Karl May gave his last public speech there. He had an audience of about 2000 people. In September 1913, the first films that had sound were shown in the building. This was later stopped however, as there were problems with making sure the sound was at the right time in the film (called synchronicity).
In May 1938, Richard Suchenwirth founded the NSDAP Austria section there. During the war, the venue was used to collect the Jews (who were later deported). The building was restored to its former glory by Carl Appel in 1948. In the 1950, DECCA installed the most modern recording studio in Europe in the rooms. The studio was used until the 1970s, to make recordings of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, amongst others.
In the 1990s, it was used as a clubbing venue.
It burned down completely in a fire, in 2001. Today, 3 walls of the bigger room (with the pool) are left, as well as some remains of the outer walls and façade. The latest plans are to rebuild it as a hotel.
