The United Nations General Assembly is made up of all United Nations member states. The Assembly meets once a year, which usually begins on the third Tuesday in September and ends in mid-December.
Voting in the General Assembly on important questions, for example suggestions on peace and security, is by two-thirds of those present and voting. Other questions are decided by popular vote. Each member country has one vote.
