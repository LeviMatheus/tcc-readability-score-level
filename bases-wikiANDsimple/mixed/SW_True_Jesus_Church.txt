The True Jesus Church is a Christian church. It was started during the early 20th century. It is an independent Church. It split from the Pentecostal movement in China. The pentecostal movement is an evangelical movement within Christianity.
Currently their churches are found in forty two countries and six continents. Followers of the Church believe that god has only a divine nature, they therefore reject the idea of trinity.
Christian holidays were often near the dates of pagan ones. This is also true for Easter, Christmas and Good Friday. The feast of Sol invictus was on the 25th of December. It was a very important holiday in Ancient Rome. Because of the pagan origins of the holidays, the True Jesus Church does not celebrate Easter and Chrismas. The movement has between 1.5 and 2.5 million followers.
