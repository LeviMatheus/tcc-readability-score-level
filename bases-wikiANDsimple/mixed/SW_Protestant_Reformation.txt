The Protestant Reformation is a term used by people to describe a series of events that happened in the 16th century in the Christian Church. Some people saw a need to change the way the Catholic church worked.
People like Erasmus, Martin Luther and Calvin saw this, and acted against it. This led to a split of the church, into Catholic church (that was there before) and a number of Protestant churches.
Martin Luther was the first person to translate the Bible into German. He could even print some copies, because Johannes Gutenberg had invented a way to print a small number of copies (approximately 50-100) at a relatively low price. The Protestant reformation triggered the Catholic Counter-Reformation.
