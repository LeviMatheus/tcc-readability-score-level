The Spanish language is one of the most common Romance languages that came from the Latin language. The Spanish language is used by many people in the world today. This is partly because the people of Spain travelled to and colonized many different parts of the world. They started many new countries, and also new governments in some old countries. The countries that have Spanish as a official language are called the Hispanic countries
Costa Rica, Cuba, The Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, and El Salvador. In the United States and Belize, most people use the English language, but Spanish is the second most-used language.
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela.
The Philippines, and Equatorial Guinea.
In Spain, there are other languages closely related to Spanish, like Catalan and Galician. Basque is also spoken, but it is not related to Spanish. Therefore, the Spanish language is sometimes called Castilian, named after Castile, a region in Spain.
The Spanish word for Spanish is "Espa√±ol", and the Spanish word for Castilian is "Castellano".
