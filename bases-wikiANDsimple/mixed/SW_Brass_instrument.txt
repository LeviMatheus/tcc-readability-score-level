A brass instrument is a musical instrument that you play by blowing through a mouthpiece to change the pitch, or note.
With brass instruments, the sound starts at the lips.
Their mouthpieces just help your lips buzz. It doesn't matter if the instrument is really made of brass, as long as it works that way.
It is not important what the instrument is made of. Some brass instruments are really made of wood, but are still called brass instruments, like the serpent. Other instruments are made of brass but don't work like this, like the saxophone. They are not called brass instruments although they are made of brass.
There are also parts of the instrument that change the pitch, like slides or valves.
A brass band is a group of brass instruments and drums that play music together. They are often used to play for parades and processions because the players can march and play at the same time. Brass bands were very popular in England. Many factories and coal mines had their own bands. The workers would play in the bands after work. One famous band is the Grimethorpe Colliery Band.
