Meaning of red-violet.
Red-violet is used to represent wine (especially in advertising and in animated films, and thus is associated with the Greek god Dionysus and with celebrations, parties, and the theatre in general (In Greek mythology, Dionysus was the god of the theatre as well as of wine).
Electric purple observed on spectrum beyond violet by ultraviolet sensitives.
It has been reported by ophthalmologists that those who have their lenses removed and replaced with clear plastic intraocular lenses can see partway into the ultraviolet and view electric purple (a shade of red-violet) on the spectrum beyond violet because it has been shown that the retina has some ultraviolet sensitivity which is normally blocked by the natural lens. Presumably, tetrachromatic animals such as birds can also see this color on the spectrum. These observers able to see partially into the ultraviolet describe the color they can see beyond violet in the ultraviolet as a sort of lilac, that is, red-violet (purple), the color of the lilac flower.
