"Thunbergia" Retz. is a genus of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, native to tropical regions of Africa, Madagascar and southern Asia. Its members are known by various names, including thunbergias; clockvine on its own usually refers to "Thunbergia grandiflora", while "Thunbergia alata" is often known as Black-eyed Susan vine or just Black-eyed Susan (not to be confused with other flowers called Black-eyed Susan). Orange clockvine is the name of "Thunbergia gregorii".
Thunbergia was named for Carl Peter Thunberg.
