Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) is the universal energy currency for all living things. Every cell in the world uses ATP for energy. It consists of a base (adenine) and three phosphate groups. It can be made many different ways, but mainly it is made by cellular respiration.
Formation.
ATP is formed in photosynthesising plants. ATP is made during a stage of photosynthesis. When an excited electron activates a gate that allows protons into the cell, the protons can not get out. As the concentration increases, the internal pressure increases as well. Soon, a small gate opens, allowing protons through. Upon their exit, the proton starts a reaction between an ADP molecule (Adenosine Diphosphate) and a phosphate. The two are joined together and form ATP. In animals, ATP is made during Cellular respiration: it makes 2 ATP molecules in glycolysis, and 36 in the electron transport chain. Therefore, cellular respiration creates a total of 38 ATP in one cycle.
Usage.
ATP is a very versatile molecule, meaning that it can be used for many things. Energy is stored in chemical bonds in molecules. When a bond is broken, energy is released. Also, when a bond is made, energy is stored. When ADP binds with another phosphate, energy is stored that can be used later. When ATP breaks a bond with a phosphate group and becomes ADP, energy is released. The ATP phosphate exchange is a nearly never-ending cycle, stopping only when the cell dies. ATP gives energy to most of the cell's functions: the sodium-potassium pumps in the cell membrane require ATP to break into ADP and the loose phosphate must bind to the pump. All active transports require ATP in some form.
