A red dwarf is a kind of star. "Dwarf" means small. Red dwarf stars are all smaller than half the size of the Sun. They are smaller and colder than other stars. Red dwarfs burn their fuel slowly, so they shine less light than hot stars.
Almost all stars are the red dwarf kind of star. The closest star to the Earth is named Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf.
Life and Death.
Red dwarfs can live trillions of years. A red dwarf dies when it burns all of its fuel. This fuel is the chemical element Hydrogen. When there is not enough Hydrogen, the red dwarf becomes smaller and colder. Because it is smaller and colder, it shine less light.
Red dwarfs are small stars that are around 0.2 solar mass (the sun is equal to 1 solar mass), this is small for a star but is still 60,000 times the mass of the earth. They are formed in nebulas, like all stars are, and originally they are proto stars. They start their nuclear fusion about 10,0000 years after being created when they get there red glow, this is also where they get their heat. These stars burn at about 10,000Â°C. After trillions of years they fade to brown stars which are large lumps of rock and iron.
