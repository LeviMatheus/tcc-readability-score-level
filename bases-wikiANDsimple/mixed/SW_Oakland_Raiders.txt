American Football League years (1960-1969).
Few moths after AFL's first draft in 1959, owners of the Minneapolis new team (later known as the Minnesota Vikings) accepted the invitation to join the established National Football League. Needed a replacement, the AFL tried to find one quickly. Oakland was a unlikely city to have a professional American football team. The AFL owners selected Oakland after Los Angeles Chargers owner Barron Hilton threatened to lose his team unless a second team was placed on the West Coast. So, the city of Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL team on January 30, 1960, and the team took over the Minneapolis club's draft picks. In the early years, the Raiders struggled. When Al Davis came in as head coach and general manager, the Raiders improved. Davis hired John Rauch and went to the their first AFL Championship against the Houston Oilers and won it 40-7. After winning their first AFL championship they earned a shot at Super Bowl II and lost to Green Bay Packers 33-14. The next two years, the Raiders again won Western Division titles, only to lose the AFL Championship to the eventual Super Bowl winnersâ€”the New York Jets (1968) and Kansas City Chiefs (1969).
