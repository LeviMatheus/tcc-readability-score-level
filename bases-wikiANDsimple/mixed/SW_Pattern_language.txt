Pattern language is used to mean a system of patterns that have a certain meaning other than just the pattern.
Method.
The pattern can be a pattern which has a hidden meaning shown through any sense like sight, sound, touch, taste and smell.
Sight.
The most obvious form of sight-based pattern language comes in the form of writing. Nearly every language has a unique written form, which grammatically follows the spoken form.
