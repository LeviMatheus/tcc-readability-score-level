Sonneberg is a "Landkreis" (rural district) in the south of Thuringia, Germany.
History.
The district was created in 1868 when districts were created in Saxe-Meiningen. In 1952 part of the district was incorporated into the newly created district Neuhaus am Rennweg. This district was dissolved again in 1994 and the district Sonneberg did regain its old size.
