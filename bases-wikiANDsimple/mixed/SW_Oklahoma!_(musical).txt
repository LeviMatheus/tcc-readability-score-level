"Oklahoma!" is a musical play first performed on Broadway in 1943. The music was composed by Richard Rodgers and the words to the songs were written by Oscar Hammerstein.
This was the first collaboration (working together) by Rodgers and Hammerstein but they made several more successful musicals together.
The story is set in Oklahoma Territory outside the town of Claremore in 1906. A cowboy Curly McLain is in love with a farmer girl Laurey Williams. Jud Fry, a farm hand, is also in love with Laurey. The play also includes the story of another cowboy, Will, and his girlfriend, Ado Annie.
The play was made into a film in 1955.
