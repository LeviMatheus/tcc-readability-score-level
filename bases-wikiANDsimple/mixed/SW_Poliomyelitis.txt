Poliomyelitis or polio is a serious virus that causes a disease. It is spread from person to person. Most of the time, polio has no symptoms unless it goes into the blood. It is uncommon for it to enter the brain or spinal cord. If this does happen, it can cause one to become paralyzed. Vaccines from World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Rotary International could stop the disease all over the world.
