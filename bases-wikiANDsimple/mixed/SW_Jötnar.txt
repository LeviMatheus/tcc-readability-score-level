A Jotun or Jötun in Norse mythology, is a giant. In Old Norse they were called Jötnar. They are known for their very big strength. Very often they were against the gods, but they sometimes mixed. Marriages between giants and gods exist. Their stronghold is called Utgardr and it is in Jötunheimr. This is one of the nine worlds of the Norse cosmology. Jötunheim is separated from Midgard by high mountains, and big forests. Outside their home world, giants seem to prefer to live in caves.
