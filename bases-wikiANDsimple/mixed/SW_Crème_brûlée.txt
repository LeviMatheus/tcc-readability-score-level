Crème brûlée (or Crème brulée) (French for "burnt cream"; in English, in French) is a dessert made of custard and topped with a layer of hard caramel. This caramel is made by burning sugar under a grill, or with a blowtorch. Crème brûlée is usually eaten cold in small bowls.
The custard base is normally flavoured with vanilla, but it can be flavoured with chocolate, liqueur, fruit, or other. Sometimes the hardened sugar on top will be covered in liqueur and set on fire.
