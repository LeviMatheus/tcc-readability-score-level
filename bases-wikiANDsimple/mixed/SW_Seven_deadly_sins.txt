People see that some of those sins are connected. They have tried to put an order to them. For example, pride (love of self out of proportion) is needed for gluttony (the over-consumption or waste of food), as well as sloth, envy, and most of the others.
Each of those sins is a way to not loving god and to not loving the others as much as oneself. The Scholastic theologians developed schema of attribute and substance of will to explain these sins.
As previously mentioned, the Latin words for the sins are: "superbia, avaritia, luxuria, invidia, gula, ira" and "accidia".
The first letters of these words form the medieval Latin word "saligia", whence the verb "saligiare" (to commit a deadly sin) is taken. Various mnemonic devices exist for remembering the sins in English, e.g. PEG'S LAW (pride, envy, gluttony, sloth, lust, avarice, wrath).
In the official Catechism of the Catholic Church, consisting of 2,865 numbered sections and first published in 1992 by order of Pope John Paul II, the seven deadly sins are dealt with in one paragraph. The principal codification of moral transgression for Christians continues to be the Ten Commandments and the Beatitudes, which are a positive statement of morality, and part of the Sermon on the Mount.
The opposite of these sins are the seven virtues (chastity, moderation, charity, zeal, meekness, generosity, and humility) in corresponding order to the above seven deadly sins.
Punishments.
According to the Divine Comedy, there are punishments for those who die with unconfessed deadly sins. Those guilty of lust, are in the second circle of the purgatory. There they are blown around by a strong wind, without the hope of ever resting. This is because lust is so powerful, that it can blow one around without need or aim.
The gluttons are in the third circle. There, they are forced to lie in a kind of slush, made by freezing rain, black snow, and hail. This used to symbolize what they made with their life.
