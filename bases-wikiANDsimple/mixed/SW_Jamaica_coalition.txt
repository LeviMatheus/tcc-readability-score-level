A Jamaica coalition was the name given to a possible coalition government of Germany.
The government would have been formed by the CDU/CSU, the FDP and The Greens.
Their party colours are black, yellow and green, the same colours as the flag of Jamaica.
A Jamaica coalition was most talked about after the 1995 election in Germany when the CDU/CSU only had a few more seats that the SPD, and needed more seats the its usual partner the FDP had in order to have a majority.
