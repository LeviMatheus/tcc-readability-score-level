John Wycliffe (also spelled Wyclif, Wycliff, Wiclef, Wycliffe, Wicliffe, or Wickliffe) was a theologian. He wrote that papal claims of temporal power had no foundation in the scriptures and that the scriptures alone should be the standard of Christian belief and practice. He lived from 1330 to 1384 in England. Wyclif was very intellectual, however his ideas may have been looked down on by many but that was only because they were too radical for the people of the time.
