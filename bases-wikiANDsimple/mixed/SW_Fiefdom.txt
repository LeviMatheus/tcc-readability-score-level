In feudalism, a fiefdom (also called a fief, feud, feoff, or fee) was a piece of land that a lord gave a vassal in exchange for loyalty and protection from enemies. Unlike a manor, a fief was undeveloped (It had no buildings or crops on it). Vassals would build upon this land to create their own housing.
