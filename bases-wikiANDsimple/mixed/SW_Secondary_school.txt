Secondary school is the next step up from primary school. Secondary school are also commonly known as high school.
In Australia a person will generally start secondary school when they are at the age of twelve and finish when they are either sixteen or eighteen, depending on whether they finish with years 11 and 12. In secondary school a person will advance through the year levels (or grades) each year.
Generally there are five to six years of high school. The first year of high school is normally either grade 7 or 8, and then proceeds on to year 10 or 12.
In some schools in Australia years 11 and 12 are just a normal part of high school. Though some other schools may only progress through to year 10, in this case students will then go to college (years 11 and 12).
At the end of secondary school, students will usually sit a unified examination, for example GCSE (in the UK).
