Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game character. He is a 15 year old blue hedgehog who can run at the speed of sound. He has been in many games, but also in television series, books and comics (published in America by Archie Comics). He has many friends, including Miles "Tails" Prower, a fox that can fly or Knuckles the Echidna (who is strong, and has been in Sonic games since "Sonic the Hedgehog 3"). With them, he fights against Doctor Eggman, an evil scientist who tries to take over the world. When Sonic's first game came out, Doctor Eggman was called Doctor Robotnik.
In games.
Sonic is the mascot of Sega, which created it in the early 1990s. At first, Sega wanted Doctor Eggman to be their mascot, and a good guy. But, the people in Sega liked the new idea of making a blue hedgehog as the mascot. Doctor Eggman settled as the bad guy instead.
In cartoons.
He appeared in his own made-for-video movie in 1999.
In most of the cartoons from the 1990s his voice was provided by Jaleel White (who was best known at the time for his role as Steve Urkel on the television show "Family Matters") and in later cartoons his voice was provided by Jason Griffith. Sonic also stars in his latest cartoon from Japan. It is called "Sonic X", although Sonic X has possibly ended.
In comic books.
mega Comics in America has been making comics with Sonic as the main character. He is also shown with famous characters like Knuckles and Tails, but with also a few new ones. Some of the characters cannot be found in any Sonic games, but some could be found from a very old cartoon, "Sonic the Hedgehog SATAM", made by DiC in 1993.
Others.
Super Sonic is actually Sonic himself. As Super Sonic, Sonic is faster and stronger, and he is gold in color. He becomes Super Sonic only if he has found all seven Chaos Emeralds and, in the old games, collects 50 gold rings. He was first shown in "Sonic the Hedgehog 2".
