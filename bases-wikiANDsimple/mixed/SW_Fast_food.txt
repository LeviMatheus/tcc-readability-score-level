Fast food is the term for a kind of food that people eat from a restaurant where you get what is called "junk food". There are many different kinds of fast food, but the most popular are hamburgers, cheeseburgers and french fries (chips). These foods are cooked and served very quickly, and that is why it is called "fast" food.
Some people think that fast food tastes very good. Other people think that the ingredients in fast food are unhealthy. Eating fast food often may cause obesity (it means, it makes you fat). It can also lead to other health problems.
The restaurants that sell fast food are called "fast food shops" or "fast food restaurants". Some of the more common fast food restaurants are McDonald's, Wendy's, Burger King, Taco Bell, and KFC. When a lot of fast food is eaten, it can be very bad for the person eating it. It can cause many bad conditions, such as high cholesterol, clogged arteries, diabetes, death with illnesses, young kids getting diabetes, and obesity.
