Esperantujo () or Esperantio is the Esperanto community: the community of speakers of the Esperanto language and their culture, as well as the places and institutions where the language is used. The term is used "as if it were a country."
Although it does not occupy its own area of Earth's surface, it can be said to constitute the 120 countries which have their own national Esperanto association.
Etymology and terminology.
The word is formed analogously to country names. In Esperanto, the names of countries were traditionally formed from the ethnic name of their inhabitants plus the suffix "-ujo", for example, "France" was "Francujo", from "franco" (a Frenchman).
The term analogous to "Francujo" would be "Esperantistujo" (Esperantist-nation). However, that would convey the idea of the physical body of people, whereas using the name of the language as the basis of the word gives it the more abstract connotation of a cultural sphere.
Currently, names of nation states are often formed with the suffix "-io" traditionally reserved for deriving country names from geographic features, so now "Francio", and recently the form "Esperantio" has been used "i.a." in the Pasporta Servo and the Esperanto Citizens' Community.
History.
In 1908, Dr. Wilhelm Molly attempted to create an Esperanto state in the Prussian-Belgian condominium of Neutral Moresnet, known as "Amikejo" (place of friendship). What became of it is unclear, and Neutral Moresnet was annexed to Belgium in the Treaty of Versailles, 1919.
During the 1960s came a new effort of creating an Esperanto state, which this time was called Republic of Rose Island. The state island stood in the Adriatic Sea near Italy.
In Europe on 2 June 2001 a number of organizations (they prefer to call themselves establishments) founded the "Esperanta Civito", which "aims to be a subject of international law" and "aims to consolidate the relations between the Esperantists who feel themselves belonging to the diaspora language group which does not belong to any country". "Esperanto Civito" always uses the name Esperantujo (introduced by Hector Hodler in 1908), which itself is defined according to their interpretation of "raumism", and the meaning, therefore, may differ from the traditional Esperanto understanding of the word "Esperantujo".
Geography.
Esperantujo means any physical place as Esperanto meetings or virtual networks where they meet Esperanto speakers. Sometimes it is said that it is everywhere, where Esperanto speakers are yet connected.
There is a German city, Herzberg am Harz, which since 12 July 2006 is called "the Esperanto city". There are bilingual signs and pointers, in both German and Esperanto.
Judging by the members of the World Esperanto Association, the countries with the most Esperanto speakers are (in descending order): Brazil, Germany, Japan, France, the United States, China, Italy.
A language learning partner application called Amikumu has been launched in 2017, allowing Esperanto speakers to find each other.
Politics.
Associations.
There is no governmental system in Esperantujo because it is not a true state. However, there is a social hierarchy of associations:
Also there are thematic associations worldwide, which are concerned with spirituality, hobbies, science or that brings together Esperantists which share common interests.
There is also a number of global organizations, such as Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda (SAT), or the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO), which has 46 national sections.
Foreign relations.
Universal Esperanto Association is not a governmental system; however, the association represents Esperanto worldwide. In addition to the United Nations and UNESCO, the UEA has consultative relationships with UNICEF and the Council of Europe and general cooperative relations with the [[Organization of American States]]. UEA officially collaborates with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) by means of an active connection to the ISO Committee on terminology (ISO/TC 37). The association is active for information on the [[European Union]] and other interstate and international organizations and conferences. UEA is a member of [[European Language Council]], a joint forum of universities and linguistic associations to promote the knowledge of languages and cultures within and outside the European Union. Moreover, on 10 May 2011, the UEA and the [[Infoterm|International Information Center for Terminology]] (Infoterm) signed an Agreement on Cooperation, its objectives are inter exchange information, support each other and help out for projects, meetings, publications in the field of terminology and by which the UEA become Associate Member of Infoterm.
Political movement.
In 2003 there was a European political movement called [[Europe–Democracy–Esperanto]] created. Within it is found a European federation that brings together local associations whose statutes depends on the countries. The working language of the movement is Esperanto. The goal is "to provide the [[European Union]] with the necessary tools to set up member rights democracy". The [[international auxiliary language|international language]] is a tool to enable cross-border political and social dialogue and actively contribute to peace and understanding between peoples. The original idea in the first ballot was mainly to spread the existence and the use of Esperanto to the general public. However, in France voices have grown steadily: 25067 (2004) 28944 (2009) and 33115 (2014). In this country there are a number of movements which support the issue: [[France Équité]], [[Europe-Liberté]], and [[Politicat]].
Symbols.
[[File:Flag of Esperanto.svg|thumb|[[Flag of Esperanto|Verda Flago]].]]
The [[flag of Esperanto]] is called "Verda Flago" (Green Flag). It consists of:
The anthem is called "La Espero" since 1891: it is a poem written by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. The song is usually sung at the triumphal march composed by [[Félicien Menu de Ménil]] in 1909.
The Jubilee symbol represents the language internally, while the flag represents the Esperanto movement. It contains the Latin letter E (Esperanto) and the Cyrillic letter Э (Эсперанто) symbolizing the unification of West and East. The Jubilee symbol has been controversial, with some Esperantists derisively calling it "the melon." 
In addition, Ludwik Lejzer Zamenhof, the initiator of the language, is often used as a symbol. Sometimes he is even called "Uncle Zam", referring to the cartoon incarnation of American [[Uncle Sam]].
Population.
Education.

In addition to textbooks, including the "[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]" by Zamenhof, the [[Assimil]]-methods and the video-methods such as [[Muzzy in Gondoland]] of the [[BBC]] and "[[Pasporto al la tuta mondo]]", there are many courses for learning online. Moreover, some universities teach Esperanto, and the [[ELTE-ITK|Higher Foreign Language training (University Eötvös Loránd)]] delivers certificates in accordance with the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] (CEFR). More than 1600 people have such a certificate around the world: in 2014 around 470 at the level of B1, 510 at the level of B2 and 700 for C1. The [[International League of Esperanto Teachers]] (ILEI) is also working to publish learning materials for teachers.
The University of Esperanto offers video lectures in Esperanto, for specialties like Confronting War, Informational Technologies and Astronomy. Courses are also held during the [[World Esperanto Congress]] in the framework of the [[Internacia Kongresa Universitato]] (IKU). After that, [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] uploads the related documents on its website.
Science is an appropriate department for works in Esperanto. For example, the [[Conference on the Application of Esperanto in Science and Technology]] (KAEST) occurs in November every year since 1998 in the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]]. Personal initiatives are also common: Doctor of mathematics [[Ulrich Matthias]] created a document about the foundations of Linear Algebra and the American group of [[Maine]] (USA) wrote a guidebook to learn the programming language [[Python (programming language)|Python]].
In general, Esperanto is used as a [[lingua franca]] in some websites aiming teaching of other languages, such as [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Wolof language|Wolof]] or [[Toki Pona]].
Media.
Since 1889 when "[[La Esperantisto]]" appeared, and soon other magazines in Esperanto throughout many countries in the world. Some of them are information media of Esperanto associations ("[[Esperanto (magazine)|Esperanto]]", "[[Sennaciulo]]" and "[[Kontakto]]"). Online Esperanto magazines like "[[Libera Folio]]", launched in 2003, offer independent view of the Esperanto movement, aiming to soberly and critically shed light on current development. Most of the magazines deal with current events; one of such magazines is "[[Monato]]", which is read in more than 60 countries. Its articles are written by correspondents from 40 countries, which know the local situation very well. Other most popular Esperanto newspapers are "[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]", "[[Beletra Almanako]]", "[[Literatura Foiro]]", and "[[Heroldo de Esperanto]]". Often national associations magazines are also published in order to inform about the movement in the country, such as "Le Monde de l'espéranto" of [[Espéranto-France]]. There are also scientific journals, such as "[[Scienca Revuo]]" of [[Internacia Scienca Asocio Esperantista]] (ISAE).
"Muzaiko" is a radio that has broadcast an all-day international program of songs, interviews and current events in Esperanto since 2011. The latest two can be downloaded as podcasts. Besides Muzaiko, these other stations offer an hour of Esperanto-language broadcasting of various topics: "[[Radio Libertaire]]", "[[Polskie Radio]]", "[[Vatican Radio]]", "[[Varsovia Vento]], "[[Radio Verda]] and "[[Kern.punkto]]".
Internet.
Spread of the [[Internet]] has enabled more efficient communication among Esperanto speakers and slightly replaced slower media such as [[mail]]. Many massively used websites such as [[Facebook]] or [[Google]] offer Esperanto interface. On 15 December 2009, on the occasion of the jubilee of 150th birthday of [[L. L. Zamenhof]], Google additionally made visible the Esperanto flag as a part of their [[Google Doodles]]. Media as [[Twitter]], [[Telegram (software)|Telegram]], [[Reddit]] or [[Ipernity]] also contain a significant number of people in this community. In addition, content-providers such as [[WordPress]] and [[YouTube]] also enable bloggers write in Esperanto. Esperanto versions of programs such as the office suite [[LibreOffice]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]] browser, or the educational program about programming [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] are also available. Additionally, online games like [[Minecraft]] offer complete Esperanto interface.
[[Monero (cryptocurrency)|Monero]], an anonymous [[cryptocurrency]], was named after the Esperanto word for "coin" and its official [[Cryptocurrency wallet|wallet]] is available in Esperanto. The same applies to Monerujo ("Monero container"), the only [[Open-source software|open-source]] wallet for [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. 
Sport.
Although Esperanto is not a country, there is an [[Esperanto football team]] , which has existed since 2014 and participates in matches during [[World Esperanto Congress]]es. The team is part of the [[N.F.-Board]] and not of [[FIFA]], and have played against the teams of Armenian-originating Argentine Community in 2014 and the team from [[Western Sahara]] in 2015.
Esperanto speakers and Esperantists.
Initially, Esperanto speakers learned the language as it was described by [[L. L. Zamenhof]]. In 1905 the "[[Fundamento de Esperanto]]" put together the first Esperanto textbook, an exercise book and a universal dictionary.
The [[Declaration of Boulogne|"Declaration about the essence of Esperantism"]] (1905) defines an "Esperantist" to be anyone who speaks and uses Esperanto. "Esperantism" was defined to be a movement to promote the widespread use of Esperanto as a supplement to [[First language|mother tongues]] in international and inter-ethnic contexts. As the word "esperantist" is linked with this "esperantism" (the [[Esperanto movement]]) and as -ists and -isms are linked with ideologies, today many people who speak Esperanto prefer to be called "Esperanto speaker".
The monthly magazine "[[La Ondo de Esperanto]]" every year since 1998 proclaims an 'Esperantist of the year', who remarkably contributed to the spreading of the language during the year.
Economy.
Businesses.
Publishing and selling books, the so-called book services, is the main market and is often the first expenditure of many Esperanto associations. Some companies are already well known: for example [[Vinilkosmo]], which publishes and makes popular Esperanto music since 1990. Then there are initiatives such as the job-seeking website "[[Eklaboru]]", created by Chuck Smith, for job offers and candidates within Esperanto associations or Esperanto meetings.
Currency.
In 1907, [[René de Saussure]] proposed the [[spesmilo]] ⟨₷⟩ as an international currency. It had some use before the First World War.
In 1942 a currency called the "[[stelo]]" ("star"; plural, "steloj") was created. It was used at meetings of the "[[Universala Ligo]]" and in Esperanto environments such as the annual [[World Esperanto Congress|Universal Congress]]. Over the years it slowly became unusable and at the official closing of the Universala Ligo in the 1990s, the remaining "steloj" coins were handed over to the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]. You can buy them at the UEA's book service as souvenirs.
The current "steloj" are made of plastic, they are used in a number of meetings, especially among young people. The currency is maintained by Stelaro, which calculates the rates, keeps the stock, and opened branches in various e-meetings. Currently, there are "stelo"-coins of 1 ★, 3 ★ and 10 ★. Quotes of Stars at 31 December 2014 were [25] 1 EUR = 4.189 ★.
Culture.
Architectural heritage.
[[File:Aŭstrio-Vieno-Zamenhof-monumento-2.jpg|thumb|right|L. L. Zamenhof [[bust (sculpture)|bust]] in the [[Esperantopark]] in [[Vienna]]]]
There exist [[Zamenhof-Esperanto object]]s (ZEOs), scattered in numerous countries around the world, which are the things named in honor of [[L. L. Zamenhof]] or Esperanto: monuments, street names, places and so on. There also exists a [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]]-committee for ZEOs.
In addition, in several countries there are also sites dedicated to Esperanto: meetup places, workshops, seminars, festivals, Esperanto houses. These places provide attractions for Esperantists. Here are two: the [[Castle of Grésilion]] in [[France]] and the [[Department of Planned Languages and Esperanto Museum]] in [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]).
Cultural heritage.
[[File:2008-07-19 kd-oj en uk-ls.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Music in Esperanto]]
Esperanto literary heritage is the richest and the most diverse of any constructed language. There are over 25,000 Esperanto books (originals and translations) as well as over a hundred regularly distributed [[List of Esperanto magazines|Esperanto magazines]].
There are also a [[List of Esperanto-language films|number of movies]] which have been published in Esperanto. Moreover, Esperanto itself was used in numerous movies.
Celebrations.
Many public holidays recognized by Esperanto speakers are celebrated international and already accepted in other countries and organizations such as [[UN]] or [[UNESCO]]. Here are the celebrations internationally proposed by the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] since 2010:
Cultural events.
[[File:Renkontighoj en Germanio partoprenantoj.png|thumb|250px|Number of participants of Esperanto-meeting in Central Europe]]
Every year numerous meetings of Esperanto speakers in different topics around the world take place. They mobilize Esperanto-speakers which share the same will about a specific topic. The main example is the [[Universal Congress of Esperanto]] (UK), which annually organizes the [[Universal Esperanto Association|UEA]] every summer for a week. Other events:
Next to these globally comprising meetings there are also local events such as [[Novjara Renkontiĝo|New Year's Gathering]] (NR) or [[Esperanto Youth Week]] (JES), which occur during the last days of December and first days of January. These meetings seem to have been successful during the last 20 years.
Due to the fact that there are a lot of Esperanto meetings around the globe, there are two websites which aim to list and share them. Eventoj.hu describes them with a list and dates, and contains an archive until 1996, while Esperant.io offers world map with the locations of future meetings.
