The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is a system of phonetic notation created by the International Phonetic Association. Founded in Paris in 1886, it was made to make a way of showing sounds of any spoken language which would be the same for every language. It is used, often on a day-to-day basis, by linguists, speech pathologists and therapists, foreign language teachers, lexicographers, and translators to transcribe words and phonemes. It is also used on Wikipedia pages to help the user know how certain words are meant to be spoken. Most symbols are letters in the Latin alphabet, or variations of it, such as the "palatal approximant" (the "y" in yesterday) is represented by. Symbols are always in brackets like this when the IPA is used.
