Pierre de Fermat (August 17, 1601 â€“ January 12, 1665) was a French lawyer at the "Parlement" of Toulouse, southern France, and a mathematician. Many people see him as the father of modern calculus.
His method of finding the biggest and smallest ordinates of curved lines also makes him a contributor to differential calculus, which was not known at that time. His studies in the theory of numbers give him the rank of the founder of the modern theory. He also made notable contributions to analytic geometry and probability.
He is also famous for making a simple mathematical statement (known as Fermat's Last Theorem) that he said he could prove, but he never wrote down his proof. Mathematicians tried to prove it for hundreds of years before finally managing it. Fermat probably didn't really have a proof for this theorem, and only thought he did.
