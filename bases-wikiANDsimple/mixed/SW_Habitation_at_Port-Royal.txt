The Habitation at Port-Royal was an early French colonial settlement and is today a National Historic Site located at Port Royal in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.
The settlement.
Port Royal was founded by the French nobleman Pierre Dugua de Monts (Sieur de Monts). He built a log fortification called a "Habitation." With assistance from members of the Mi'kmaq Nation the settlement prospered.
But the French settlers to return to France in 1607. The Habitation was left in the care of the local Mi'kmaq until 1610 when Sieur de Poutrincourt, another French nobleman, returned with a small expedition to "Port-Royal". Poutrincourt won the local Mi'kmaq for Catholicism. As a result, Jesuits became financial partners with Poutrincourt. But this caused argument within the community.
In May, 1613 the Jesuits moved on to the Penobscot River valley and in July, the settlement was attacked by Samuel Argall of Virginia. Argall returned in November that same year and burned the Habitation to the ground while settlers were away nearby. Poutrincourt returned from France in spring 1614 and found "Port-Royal" in ruins and settlers living with the Mi'kmaq. Poutrincourt then gave his holdings to his son and returned to France. Poutrincourt's son gave the settlement to Charles de Saint-Ã‰tienne de la Tour upon his own death in 1623.
Replica construction.
A replica of the settlement was built in 1939-1940. Today, this replica serves as the cornerstone of Port-Royal National Historic Site of Canada, and coupled with the nearby Fort Anne National Historic Site of Canada in Annapolis Royal, continues to remind of this important historic region for Canadians and visitors.
