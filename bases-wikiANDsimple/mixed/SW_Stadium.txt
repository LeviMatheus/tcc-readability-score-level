A stadium is a building in which lots of people may watch an event. They are often used for football and athletics. Some stadiums are paid to add a company name to the name of their stadium. For example, "Comerica" Park in Detroit, Michigan, or the ALLTELL Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida. Companies which do this are said to have the "naming rights" for the stadium. The name of a stadium can change when another company buys the naming rights to that stadium.
An arena is a small indoor stadium. Arenas are often used for many different types of events. These include sports and music.
