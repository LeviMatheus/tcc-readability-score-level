Immigrants are people who move to another country or region than their own to live there.
"Immigrant" and "emmigrant" do not mean the same thing. An "immigrant" is a person that leaves his or her own country or region and an "emmigrant" is a person that comes from other country or region.
The phrases "many people emigrated from Europe in the 19th century to America" and "many people immigrated to America from Europe in the 19th century" have the same meaning.
