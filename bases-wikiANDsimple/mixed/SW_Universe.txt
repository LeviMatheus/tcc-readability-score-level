In astronomy, the universe is "everything out there". It contains the sun, all the planets including Earth, all of our galaxy, plus many other galaxies, and all of outer space. It is so huge that scientists measure its size in billions of light years - the distance light travels in a whole year. To travel in a spaceship, using today's knowledge, to even the nearest star would take centuries. In between the stars and galaxies, it is mostly empty and very cold.
"Cosmology" is the science studying its origin, how it changes, and its future. Through history, different theories about it have been made, but the theory accepted by most scientists today is called the "Big Bang". It tells us the universe was once very dense, and then began expanding ("bang") a long time ago.
Across history, many people have come up with ideas explaining how the universe came to be. Many origin myths, folktales that are passed from generation to generation that try to tell how the universe formed, have been created. Some have tried to explain it using gods, these stories are known as "religious creation myths". No one really knows the answer, and this has been the subject of many theories.
