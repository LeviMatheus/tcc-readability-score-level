Charon is the moon of the dwarf planet Pluto. It is half the size as Pluto and is much like the dwarf planet itself, and was not discovered much later after discovering Pluto.
It is named after Charon in Greek mythology, a boatman who would carry the souls of dead people across the river Styx to the underworld.
Because of Charon's size compared with Pluto, some astronomers regard Pluto and Charon as a double planet.
