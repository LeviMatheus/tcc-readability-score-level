The 12-hour clock is a way of determining the time in which the 24 hours of the day are divided into two sections called "ante meridiem" ("a.m.") and "post meridiem" ("p.m."). Both names are from Latin, and numbered from 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11. Time from midnight to noon is a.m. and from noon to midnight p.m. The table at right shows how it relates to the 24-hour clock.
