John McEnroe is a retired professional tennis player from New York in the USA. He is thought of as one of the best tennis players of all time. He was once ranked number 1 in the world. He is remembered for his quick temper with the umpire and his rivalries with players such Bjorn Borg. He is probably also famous for his "You cannot be serious!" rant directed to an umpire in 1981 at Wimbledon.
