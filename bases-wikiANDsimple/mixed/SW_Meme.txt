A meme (pronunciation:miÀêm), is a term for a theoretical unit of cultural information.
The theory behind the term is that culture develops analogously to plants and animals. The way in which a gene propagates from one organism to another as a unit of genetic information and of biological evolution would be analogous to the development of memes.
Biologist and evolutionary theorist Richard Dawkins coined the term "meme" in 1976. He gave as examples tunes, catch-phrases, beliefs, clothing fashions, ways of making pots, and the technology of building arches.

The "Memetic Lexicon" lists meme-attributes compiled by Glenn Grant under a "share-alike" licence. The examples it offers may help to focus the concept. The Lexicon has circulated since the early 1990s, and evolved into its version 3.5 of its memeplex (Memelex) in 2004:. One should keep in mind that Glenn Grant has the background of a writer of fiction rather that of an authority on memetics: many of the terms in the lexicon he simply invented as an experiment in the spread of his own self-generated memes.
