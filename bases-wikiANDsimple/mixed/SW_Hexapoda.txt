The subphylum Hexapoda, meaning "six legs", is the largest (in terms of number of species) group of arthropods and includes the insects as well as three much smaller groups of arthropods without wings: Collembola, Protura, and Diplura (all of these were called insects before). In other words, hexapoda is divided into the insects and the entognatha. "Hexapods" are called hexapods because they have a thorax with three pairs of legs. Most other arthropods have more than three pairs of legs.
