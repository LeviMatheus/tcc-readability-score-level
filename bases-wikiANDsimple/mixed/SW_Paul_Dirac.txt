Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac, Order of the Merit (* August 8th, 1902 in Bristol; † October 20th, 1984 in Tallahassee) was an English physicist.
Dirac's father came from the French-speaking part of Switzerland.
Dirac worked out a formulation of quantum mechanics, which includes Erwin Schrödinger's wave mechanics and Werner Heisenberg's matrix mechanics in 1926.
In 1928 he found the Dirac equation and he found out that spin in quantum mechanics is an effect of relativity.
In 1933 he won the Nobel Prize for Physics.
