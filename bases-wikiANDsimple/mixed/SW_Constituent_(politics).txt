A constituent is someone who elects another person as their representative in the government. A "constituency" is all of the constituents of a representative. Constituents also have the power to remove their representative from the position to which they have appointed him or her.
The word "constituent" can also be used to refer to a citizen who lives in the area that is governed, represented, or otherwise served by a politician; sometimes the word is restricted to citizens who elected the politician. All of the constituents who are registered to vote are called the "electorate".
