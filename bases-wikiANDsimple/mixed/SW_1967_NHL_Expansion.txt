The National Hockey League (NHL) went through an expansion for the 1967â€“68 NHL season, adding six new franchises and doubling the size of the league. This marked the first change in the composition of the league since 1942.
The expansion process began in March 1965, when NHL President Clarence Campbell announced that the league proposed to expand its operations through the formation of a second six-team division.
