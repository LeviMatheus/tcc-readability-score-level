The Vande Mataram is the national song of India. It is not to be confused with the national anthem of India. The lyrics were written by Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay, in a mix of Sanskrit and Bengali. The song was written in 1876, but published in 1882. The title means "Long live the Mother[land]". The first version of the Flag of India had "वन्दे मातरम्" (Vande Mataram) written on it.
Controversy.
Jana Gana Mana was chosen over "Vande Mataram"as the National Anthem of independent India in January 24, 1950, although before this date, "Vande Mataram" was trated as such. Vande Mataram was rejected because Muslims offended by calling India "Mother Durga" (a Hindu goddess) equating the nation with Hinduism, and by its origin as part of "Anandamatha", a book they felt had an anti-Muslim message.

सप्त कोटि कण्ठ कलकल निनाद कराले
तुमि विद्या तुमि धर्म, तुमि ह्रदि तुमि मर्म
Translation.
Cool with thy winds of delight,
Green fields waving Mother of might,
Over thy branches and lordly streams,
Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands
When swords flash out in seventy million hands
Thy dreadful name from shore to shore?
With many strengths who art mighty and stored,
To thee I call Mother and Lord!
Thou who saves, arise and save!
To her I cry who ever her foe drove
Thou art wisdom, thou art law,
Thou art heart, our soul, our breath
Though art love divine, the awe
In our hearts that conquers death.
Thine the strength that nerves the arm,
Thine the beauty, thine the charm.
In our temples is but thine.
Thou art Durga, Lady and Queen,
With her hands that strike and her
In thy soul, with jewelled hair
Mother sweet, I bow to thee,
"translated by Sri Aurobindo"
Translation.
Cool with thy winds of delight,
Green fields waving Mother of might,
