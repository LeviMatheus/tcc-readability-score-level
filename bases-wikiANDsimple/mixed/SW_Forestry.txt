HI EVERY BODY ITS ME GMAN117GMAN.
Forestry means working to look after forests. Someone who has a job looking after forests is called a forester.
Forests are very important for the world today. Many of them are disappearing because there are so many people in the world. A forester has the job of making sure that the forest and all the wildlife that lives there is healthy. He makes sure that forests are not destroyed when they are used for timber production (cutting down trees to use the wood). Forests are important for recreation (letting people enjoy them). They are very important today because humans produce a lot of carbon dioxide and the forests help to turn this back into oxygen which we breathe.
