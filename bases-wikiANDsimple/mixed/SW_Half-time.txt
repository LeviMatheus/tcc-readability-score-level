Half-time is the name of a break in the middle of a sports-game. This break gives players a chance to rest. It also goves watchers of the game time to stretch, eat, or go to the toilet without missing the game. During half-time, there is usually a show on the field of play. It may include a marching band or something like it. This is called a half-time show.
