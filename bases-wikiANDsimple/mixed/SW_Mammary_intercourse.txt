Mammary intercourse describes a sex act, performed as foreplay or as non-penetrative sex, that involves the stimulation of the male penis by the female breasts. Commonly, this sex act involves the man placing his penis between the woman's breasts and thrusting, while the breasts are squeezed around the penis for additional stimulation. Mammary intercourse is sometimes combined with oral sex.
When mammary intercourse continues to the point of ejaculation, the semen can land on the breasts, face, or in the mouth of the woman.
Several slang terms refer to mammary intercourse, such as titfuck or titty fuck in the United States, as well as tit wank or French fuck in the United Kingdom.
