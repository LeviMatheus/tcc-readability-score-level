After the Kassite tribes took over the city of Babylon in 1750 BCE, the Kassites raid the political power in Babylon but they were soon babylonized. The first king of the Kassite dynasty, Agum-Kakrime, has defeated the Hittites and received back the statue of Marduk.
In this period, started a decline that was to last for almost a millennium. This does not mean that there was no central state, or that the Kassite kings played no role in international politics, but it is clear that Babylon was eclipsed by other nations.
