Megaraptor was a large, terrifying late Cretaceous predator with two enormous, sickle-like claws on each hand. It was a huge, lightly built, fast-moving, agile, bipedal (walked on two legs), dinosaur. It had a curved, flexible neck, and a big head with sharp, serrated teeth in very powerful jaws.
The first thing of Megaraptor to be discovered was one of its claws. As they strongly resembled the claws seen in Dromeosaurs, it was believed that Megaraptor belonged to that family, and was the largest member of it. Later, a complete hand was discovered, revealing the claw to be located on its thumb.
Megaraptor was about 20-26 feet (6-8 m) long.
