A restaurant is a place where food is sold to the public.
Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are a lot of restaurants that have the same name and serve the same food. McDonald's, Burger King, and Pizza Hut are examples of chain restaurants that are located all over the world. These restaurants serve fast food (inexpensive already-prepared food).
There are also chain restaurants that serve more expensive food. Applebee's and Perkin's are examples of this type of chain restaurant.
At some restaurants you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called drive-thrus.
