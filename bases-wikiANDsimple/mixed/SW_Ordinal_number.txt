Ordinal numbers (or ordinals) are numbers that show something's order, for example: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th.
Suppose a person has four different tee-shirts, and then lays them in front of the person, from left to right.
If the person then starts counting the shirts from the left, he would first see the red shirt. So the red shirt is the first tee-shirt. The blue shirt is the second tee-shirt. The yellow shirt is the third one, and the white tee-shirt is the fourth one.
The "first", "second", "third", and "fourth" in this case are ordinal numbers. They result from the fact that the person has many objects, and they give them an order (hence 'ordinal'). The person then simply counts those objects, and give the ordinal numbers to them.
