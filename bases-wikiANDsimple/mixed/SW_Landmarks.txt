Originally, a landmark literally meant an important, or particular geographic point, (like a mountain, a cliff, or a river) used by explorers and others to find their way back or through an area.
In modern use, it includes anything that is can be recognized easily, such as a monument, building, or other structure. In American English it is the main word used to call places that can be of interest to tourists because they are beautiful, or big, or they have historical importance. Landmarks in the British English are normally used for casual navigation, such as giving directions to someone to get somewhere. This is done in American English as well.

Landmarks also can be of two different categories: natural (e.g., physical features such as waterfalls and mountains), and structures constructed by humans.
