Truthiness is a word used by Stephen Colbert. It was first used on October 17, 2005 in the first episode of the television show "The Colbert Report". The word is used to describe something that feels truthful. Facts and logic have nothing to do with truthiness. The truthiness of something is only measured by it instinctively feeling correct.
The word was picked as the word of the year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society on January 6, 2006. It was also selected by the Merriam-Webster dictionary on December 10, 2006 as its 2006 Word of the Year. It beat the term "google" to get Word of the Year.
