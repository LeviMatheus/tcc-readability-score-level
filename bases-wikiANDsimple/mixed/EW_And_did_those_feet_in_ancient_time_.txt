"And did those feet in ancient time" is a poem by William Blake from the preface to his epic ', one of a collection of writings known as the Prophetic Books. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808. Today it is best known as the hymn "Jerusalem"'", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916. The famous orchestration was written by Sir Edward Elgar. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope, but also by Blake, called "Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion".
The poem was supposedly inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea, a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited Glastonbury during his unknown years. Most scholars reject the historical authenticity of this story out of hand, and according to British folklore scholar A. W. Smith, "there was little reason to believe that an oral tradition concerning a visit made by Jesus to Britain existed before the early part of the twentieth century". The poem's theme is linked to the Book of Revelation ( and 21:2) describing a Second Coming, wherein Jesus establishes a New Jerusalem. Churches in general, and the Church of England in particular, have long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for Heaven, a place of universal love and peace.
In the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the "dark Satanic Mills" of the Industrial Revolution. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely wonders if there had been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England. The second verse is interpreted as an exhortation to create an ideal society in England, whether or not there was a divine visit.
Text.
The original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with "Milton, a Poem", following the lines beginning "The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer &amp; Ovid: of Plato &amp; Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ..."
Blake's poem
Beneath the poem Blake inscribed a quotation from the Bible:
"Dark Satanic Mills".
[[File:Albion Flour Mills Bankside.jpg|thumb|Albion Flour Mills, [[Bankside]], London]]
The phrase "dark Satanic Mills", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early [[Industrial Revolution]] and its destruction of nature and human relationships. This view has been linked to the fate of the [[Albion Mills, Southwark|Albion Flour Mills]] in [[Southwark]], the first major factory in London. This rotary steam-powered flour mill by [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] could produce 6,000 [[bushel]]s of flour per week. The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire, perhaps [[Luddite|deliberately]]. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, "Success to the mills of [[Albion]] but no Albion Mills." Opponents referred to the factory as [[satan]]ic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a [[devil]] squatting on the building. The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.
Blake's phrase resonates with a broader theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually [[Political repression|repressive]] ideology based on a quantified reality. Blake saw the [[cotton mill]]s and [[collieries]] of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:
[[File:Milton a Poem, copy C, object 4 (Bentley 4, Erdman 6, Keynes 4) detail-a.jpg|thumb|400px|The first reference to Satan's "mills", next to images of megaliths ([[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]], copy C, object 4)]] Another interpretation, amongst [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, is that the phrase refers to the established [[Church of England]]. This church preached a doctrine of conformity to the established social order and class system, in contrast to Blake. In 2007 the new [[Bishop of Durham]], [[N. T. Wright]], explicitly recognised this element of English subculture when he acknowledged this alternative view that the "dark satanic mills" refer to the "great churches". In similar vein, the critic [[F. W. Bateson]] noted how "the adoption by the Churches and women's organizations of this anti-clerical paean of free love is amusing evidence of the carelessness with which poetry is read".
[[Stonehenge]] and other megaliths are featured in "Milton", suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general; as [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] observed, many scholars argue that the "[mills] are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for".
An alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology related to the ancient history of England. Satan's "mills" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: "the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]] / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible".
"Chariots of fire".
The line from the poem "Bring me my Chariot of fire!" draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: "And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven." The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film "[[Chariots of Fire]]", in which the hymn Jerusalem is sung during the final scenes. The plural phrase "chariots of fire" refers to [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|2 Kings 6:17]].
"Green and pleasant land".
Blake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of "Milton" while living in the village of [[Felpham]] in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's "evident pleasure" in the Felpham countryside. However, local records from Lavant, near Chichester, state that Blake wrote the poem in an east-facing alcove of the Earl of March public house.
The phrase "green and pleasant land" has become a common term for an identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside. In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life. Sometimes it is used ironically, e.g. in the [[Dire Straits]] song "[[Iron Hand (song)|Iron Hand]]".
Revolution.
Several of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: "As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)". He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical [[allegory]]. Even though the poem was written during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blake was an outspoken supporter of the [[French Revolution]], and [[Napoleon]] claimed to be continuing this revolution. The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. In 1803 Blake was charged at [[Chichester]] with high treason for having "uttered seditious and treasonable expressions", but was acquitted. The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from "[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]" ch. 11, v. 29: "Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets." [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland]] has argued that this includes
everyone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an "honest persuasion" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful."
The words of the poem "stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land.'"
Popularisation.
The poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing, was included in the patriotic anthology of verse "The Spirit of Man," edited by the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], [[Robert Bridges]], and published in 1916, at a time when morale had begun to decline because of the high number of casualties in World War I and the perception that there was no end in sight.
Under these circumstances, Bridges, finding the poem an appropriate hymn text to "brace the spirit of the nation [to] accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary," asked [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]] to put it to music for a [[Fight for Right Movement|Fight for Right campaign]] meeting in London's [[Queen's Hall]]. Bridges asked Parry to supply "suitable, simple music to Blake's stanzas â€“ music that an audience could take up and join in", and added that, if Parry could not do it himself, he might delegate the task to [[George Butterworth]].
The poem's idealistic [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] accounts for its popularity across much of the political spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]; [[Clement Attlee]] said they would build "a new Jerusalem". It has been sung at conferences of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], at the [[Glee Club (British politics)|Glee Club]] of the British [[Liberal Assembly]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].
Parry's setting of "Jerusalem".
In adapting Blake's poem as a [[unison]] song, Parry deployed a two-[[stanza]] format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a [[coda (music)|coda]], echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song. The word "those" was substituted for "these" before "dark satanic mills".
The piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student [[Walford Davies]], but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, "Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it." Davies later recalled,
Davies arranged for the vocal score to be published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] in time for the concert at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 28 March and began rehearsing it. It was a success and was taken up generally.
But Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by [[Millicent Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragists in 1917 and Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back, "I wish indeed it might become the Women Voters' hymn, as you suggest. People seem to enjoy singing it. And having the vote ought to diffuse a good deal of joy too. So they would combine happily".
Accordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors reassigned the copyright to the [[Women's Institutes]], where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.
The song was first called "And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time" and the early published scores have this title. The change to "Jerusalem" seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and "Jerusalem" inserted in a different hand). However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances. Sir [[Edward Elgar]] re-scored the work for very large orchestra in 1922 for use at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]]. Elgar's orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the [[Last Night of the Proms]] (though Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], who introduced it to that event in the 1950s, always used Parry's version).
Use as a hymn.
Although Parry composed the music as a unison song, many churches have adopted "Jerusalem" as a four-part hymn; a number of English entities, including the BBC, the Crown, cathedrals, churches, and chapels regularly use it as an office or recessional hymn on [[Saint George's Day]].
However, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the [[BBC TV]] programme "Jerusalem: An Anthem for England", have said that the song is not technically a [[hymn]] as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples appear in any hymnal). Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England. Despite this, it was sung as a hymn during the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].
Many schools use the song, especially [[Public school (UK)|public school]]s in Great Britain (it was used as the title music for the [[BBC]]'s 1979 series "Public School" at [[Radley College]]), and several private schools in Australia, New Zealand, New England and Canada. In Hong Kong, diverted version of "Jerusalem" is also used as the school hymn of St. Catherine's School for Girls, Kwun Tong and Bishop Hall Jubilee School. "Jerusalem" was chosen as the opening hymn for the [[London Olympics 2012]], although "[[God Save the Queen]]" was the anthem sung during the raising of the flag in salute to the Queen. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words; examples include the State Funeral of President Ronald Reagan in Washington National Cathedral on 11 June 2004 and the State Memorial Service for Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] on 5 November 2014.
It has been featuring on BBC Songs Of Praise for many years and in a countrywide poll to find the UK's favourite hymn in 2019, it was voted in at Number 1, knocking previous How Great Thou Art into second place.
Use as a national anthem.
Upon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] said that he preferred "Jerusalem" over the British national anthem "[[God Save the King]]". "Jerusalem" is considered to be England's most popular patriotic song; "[[The New York Times]]" said it was "fast becoming an alternative national anthem," and there have even been calls to give it official status. England has no official anthem and uses the British national anthem "[[God Save the Queen]]", also unofficial, for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including [[rugby league]], use "Jerusalem" as the English anthem. "Jerusalem" is the official hymn of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]], although "God Save the Queen" was the anthem sung before England's games in [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]], the [[2010â€“11 Ashes series]] and the [[2019 ICC Cricket World Cup]]. Questions in [[British Parliament|Parliament]] have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.
As Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team, held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games. "Jerusalem" was selected by 52% of voters over "[[Land of Hope and Glory]]" (used since 1930) and "God Save the Queen".
In 2005 [[BBC Four]] produced "Jerusalem: An Anthem For England" highlighting the usages of the song/poem and a case was made for its adoption as the [[national anthem of England]]. Varied contributions come from [[Howard Goodall]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Garry Bushell]], [[Lord Hattersley]], [[Ann Widdecombe]] and [[David Mellor]], [[Militarism|war proponents]], [[pacifism|war opponents]], [[suffragettes]], [[trade unionists]], [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schoolboys]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Football Supporters' Federation|football supporters]], the [[British National Party]], the [[Women's Institute#.22Jerusalem.22|Women's Institute]], [[London Gay Men's Chorus|a gay choir]], [[London Community Gospel Choir|a gospel choir]], [[Fat Les]] and [[Naturists#United Kingdom|naturists]].
Emerson, Lake and Palmer version.
In 1973, for their "[[Brain Salad Surgery]]" album, British progressive rock band [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] recorded a version of the song titled "Jerusalem". The track features the debut of the prototype [[Moog Apollo]], the first-ever [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic music synthesizer]]. The subject matter of this song indicates a nod to ELP's unabashed Englishness and simultaneously lent an air of timeless tradition and ceremony to the music. Though a single was released of the song, it failed to chart, and it was banned from radio play in England. The BBC would not accept it as a serious piece of music, the band claims. Drummer [[Carl Palmer]] later expressed disappointment over this decision.
A live rendition was recorded during their subsequent "Someone Get Me a Ladder" tour, and was included on the live album of the band's 1974 tour "[[Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends â€“ Ladies and Gentlemen|Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends â€“ Ladies and Gentlemen... Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]]".
Performances.
The popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently, only its most notable performances are listed below.
Use in film, television and theatre.
"Bring me my Chariot of fire" inspired the title of the film "[[Chariots of Fire]]". A church congregation sings "Jerusalem" at the close of the film and a performance appears on the "[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire soundtrack]]" performed by the [[Ambrosian Singers]] overlaid partly by a composition by [[Vangelis]]. One unexpected touch is that "Jerusalem" is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune â€“ perhaps one of the things that make it so "singable" by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was "Running" until [[Colin Welland]] saw a television programme, "[[Songs of Praise]]", featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.
The hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including "[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]", "[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]", "[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]", "[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]", "[[Calendar Girls]]", Season 3: Episode 22 of "[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]", "[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]", "[[Women in Love]]", "[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]", "[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]", "[[Jackboots on Whitehall]]", "[[Quatermass and the Pit]]", and "[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] ". An extract was heard in the 2013 "[[Doctor Who]]" episode "[[The Crimson Horror]]" although that story was set in 1893, i.e., before Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1977 film "[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]". In an episode of "[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]", Jez ([[Robert Webb]]) records a track titled "This Is Outrageous" which uses the first and a version of the second line in a verse. A modified version of the hymn, replacing the word "England" with "Neo", is used in "[[Neo Yokio]]" as the national anthem of the eponymous city state.
In the theatre it appears in "[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]", "[[Calendar Girls]]" and in "[[Time and the Conways]]". Eddie Izzard discusses the hymn in his 2000 "[[Circle (Eddie Izzard)|Circle]]" stand-up tour. Punk band [[Bad Religion]] have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their "God Song", from the 1990 album "[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]".
Other composers.
Blake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. [[Tim Blake]] (synthesiser player of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) produced a solo album in 1978 called "[[Blake's New Jerusalem]]", including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. [[Mark E. Smith]] of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] interpolated the verses with a deadpan rant against his native land in the track "Dog is life/Jerusalem" from the 1988 ballet score "[[I Am Kurious Oranj]]". The words, with some variations, are used in the track "Jerusalem" on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album "[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]", which also includes lines from book two of "Milton". [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album "[[The Blake Project: Spring]]". [[The Verve]] also referenced the song in their 2008 song "[[Love Is Noise]]" from the album [[Forth (album)|Forth.]] Lead singer and writer [[Richard Ashcroft]] said that Blake had influenced the lyric "'Will those feet in modern times"' from the song. This is not the first Verve song influenced by Blake, as their previous single "[[History (The Verve song)|History]]" also featured the lyrics "I wandered lonely streets/Behind where the old Thames does flow/And in every face I meet", referencing Blake's "[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]".
