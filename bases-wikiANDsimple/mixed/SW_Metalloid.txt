Metalloid refers to a group of chemical elements that have interesting properties. They can look like metals and act like metals at times, but they can also act like things that are not metals (nonmetals). Many metalloid elements are semiconductors because they do not conduct electricity very well.
Metalloid elements include: silicon, germanium, arsenic, tellurium, and selenium.
