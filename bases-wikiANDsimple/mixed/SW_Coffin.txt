A coffin (also known as a casket) is a funerary box used in the display and containment of deceased remains -- either for burial or after cremation.
The word comes ultimately from Greek "kophinos", a basket. In English, the word wasn't used in a funeral sense until the 1500s.
Any box used to bury the dead in is a coffin.
