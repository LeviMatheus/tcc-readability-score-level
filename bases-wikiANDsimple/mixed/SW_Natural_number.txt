Natural numbers are the numbers used for counting things. Natural numbers are positive numbers (numbers that are more than 0). They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and so on until infinity. Infinity is not a natural number. Natural numbers are also called Counting Numbers. They could also be said to be the set of all possible numbers of elements in any finite set.
