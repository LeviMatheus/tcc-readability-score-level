Year 134 (CXXXIV) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Ursus and Varus (or, less frequently, year 887 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 134 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
