"Never Gonna Give You Up" is a dance-pop song originally performed by Rick Astley. It was released as a single from Astley's multi-million selling debut album, "Whenever You Need Somebody", which was written and produced by Stock Aitken Waterman. The song was a worldwide number-one hit, initially in the singer's native United Kingdom in 1987, where it stayed at number one for five weeks and was the best-selling single of that year.
The music video for the song has become the basis for the "Rickrolling" Internet meme.
