Year 136 (CXXXVI) was a leap year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 136th Year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD)Â designations, the 136th year of the 1st millennium, the 36th year of the 2nd century, and the 7th year of the 130s decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Commodus and Civica (or, less frequently, year 889 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 136 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
