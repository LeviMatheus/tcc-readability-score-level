lorem ipsum is a standard placeholder text in publishing and graphic design. This means that it is often used to fill gaps in the page when text hasn't been put in. It is used to show the graphic elements of a document or its visual presentation, such as fonts, typography, and layout.
Lorem ipsum can also be placeholder text in mock-ups of visual design projects before the actual words are put into the finished product. This is often called greeking.
Often, readers of the text become curious about what it means. Lorem ipsum also resembles classical Latin. However, neither reaction is intended. The placeholder text is simply meant as a placeholder, to show other aspects of the document. Often, Lorem ipsum is used to show what a font or a design looks like. The distribution of letters in lorem ipsum is close to that in English language. This helps to shift the fous to presentation.
History and discovery.
The text is derived from Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum" ("On the Ends of Goods and Evils", sometimes the title is translated as "[About] The Purposes of Good and Evil"). The original passage began: "Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit" (Translation: "Neither is there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It is not known exactly when the text acquired its current standard form; it may have been as early as the 1500s (albeit with subsequent minor changes) or as late as the 1960s. The passage was discovered by Richard McClintock, a Latin professor and the Publications Director at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. He found it by searching for citings of the word 'consectetur' so he could answer a question about it in the graphic design magazine "Before & After".
English translation.
Cicero's original text: "…neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?" "
H. Rackham's 1914 translation: "Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
Variations.
Many variations on the standard "lorem ipsum" text exist, some with little resemblance to the original. Other versions have additional letters — such as "k", "w", and "z" — that were uncommon or missing in the Latin, and nonsense words such as "zzril", "takimata", and "gubergren" added to the original passage to achieve a distribution of letters that more closely approximates English.
Cicero's first Oration against Catiline is sometimes used in type specimens: "Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra? Quam diu etiam furor iste tuus nos eludet?. . ."
Today's popular version of "lorem ipsum" was first created for Aldus Corporation's first desktop publishing program Aldus PageMaker in the mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh. Art director Laura Perry adapted older forms of the "lorem" text from typography samples. The text was frequently used in PageMaker templates.
Various pieces of software, including text editors (or plug-in modules for same), can generate semi-random "lorem text" that often has little or nothing in common with the canonical variety, other than looking like (and often being) jumbled Latin. Apple, Inc.'s Pages software, uses this jumbled text as a sample screenplay for their screenplay layout.
