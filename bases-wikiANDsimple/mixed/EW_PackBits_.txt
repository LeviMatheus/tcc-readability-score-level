PackBits is a fast, simple lossless compression scheme for run-length encoding of data.
Apple introduced the PackBits format with the release of MacPaint on the Macintosh computer. This compression scheme is one of the types of compression that can be used in TIFF-files. TGA-files also use this RLE compression scheme, but treats data stream as pixels instead of bytes.
A PackBits data stream consists of packets with a one-byte header followed by data. The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or packed (such as MacPaint pixels).
In the following table, "n" is the value of the header byte as a signed integer.
Note that interpreting 0 as positive or negative makes no difference in the output. Runs of two bytes adjacent to non-runs are typically written as literal data. There is no way based on the PackBits data to determine the end of the data stream; that is to say, one must already know the size of the compressed or uncompressed data before reading a PackBits data stream to know where it ends.
Apple Computer (see the external link) provides this short example of packed data:
codice_1
The following code, written in Microsoft VBA, unpacks the data:
Sub UnpackBitsDemo()
 Dim File As Variant
 Dim MyOutput As String
 Dim Count As Long
 Dim i As Long, j As Long
 File = "FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA"
 File = Split(File, " ")
 For i = LBound(File) To UBound(File)
 Count = Application.WorksheetFunction.Hex2Dec(File(i))
 Select Case Count
 Case Is &gt;= 128
 Count = 256 - Count 'Two's Complement
 For j = 0 To Count 'zero-based
 MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + 1) &amp; " "
 Next j
 i = i + 1 'Adjust the pointer
 Case Else
 For j = 0 To Count 'zero-based
 MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + j + 1) &amp; " "
 Next j
 i = i + j 'Adjust the pointer
 End Select
 Next i
 Debug.Print MyOutput
 'AA AA AA 80 00 2A AA AA AA AA 80 00 2A 22 AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA
End Sub
The same implementation in JS:

function str2hex (str) {
 return str.split(").map(function (char) {
 var value = char.charCodeAt(0);
 return ((value &lt; 16 ? '0' : ") + value.toString(16)).toUpperCase();
 }).join(' ');
function hex2str (hex) {
 return hex.split(' ').map(function (string) {
 return String.fromCharCode(parseInt(string, 16));
 }).join(");
 * PackBits unpack function
 * @param {String} data
function unpackBits (data) {
 var output = ",
 i = 0;
 while (i &lt; data.length) {
 var hex = data.charCodeAt(i);
 if (hex &gt;= 128) {
 hex = 256 - hex;
 for (var j = 0; j &lt;= hex; ++j) {
 output += data.charAt(i + 1);
 ++i;
 else {
 for (var j = 0; j &lt;= hex; ++j) {
 output += data.charAt(i + j + 1);
 i += j;
 ++i;
 return output;
var original = 'FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA',
 data = unpackBits(hex2str(original));
// Output is: AA AA AA 80 00 2A AA AA AA AA 80 00 2A 22 AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA AA
console.log(str2hex(data));
