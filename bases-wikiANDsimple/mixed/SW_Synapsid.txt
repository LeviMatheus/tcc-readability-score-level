Synapsids ('fused arch'), also known as Theropsids ('beast face'), is a taxonomical class of animals. This class includes mammals and other animals which are close to mammals. The non-mammal animals in the group were described as 'mammal-like reptiles'. A better name for them is "stem-mammals". Synapsids are one of the two major groups of amniote. The other group is the sauropsids. They developed one opening in their skull behind each eye, about 324 million years ago during the late Carboniferous Period.
