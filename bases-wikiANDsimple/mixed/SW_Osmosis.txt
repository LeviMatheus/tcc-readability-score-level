Osmosis is the movement of water in and out of cells from a high concentration of water to a low concentration of water through a semi- permeable membrane. If the strength of the water inside the cell is more than outside, then the water moves inside the cell. If it is the same, the same amount of water moves in and out. If it is less, the cell loses water. Osmosis can be processed with food coloring and a carnation.
