The Maya languages (or Mayan languages) is a group of languages spoken in Central America.
Mayan languages are spoken by at least 6 million indigenous Maya. Most of them are in Guatemala, Mexico, or Belize. In 1996, Guatemala formally recognized 21 Mayan languages by name, and Mexico recognises eight more.
The Mayan language family is one of the best documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages come from Proto-Mayan, a language which was probably spoken at least 5,000 years ago. It has been partially reconstructed.
