Music video.
The video for "Favorite Disease" invovles the band, yet does not show any instruments being played. Trevor is only shown singing at two scenes in the song. The video is opens with four soldiers (the band) walking in line through a grass field. Trevor, the commanding officer, orders Joel, against his will, to head in one direction. As they are walking they are fired at by unseen enemies and one soldier (Joel) goes down; before Joel dies he hands Trevor a piece of paper. As the trio as eating dinner by a fire, Trevor starts singing the song and reads the paper, Trevor then proceeds to go to Joel's grave. Then a flash back occurs in which Trevors realizes that if he had not have made Joel go in the one direction Joel would have not been shot; also in the flash back it shows Trevor dying instead of Joel.
