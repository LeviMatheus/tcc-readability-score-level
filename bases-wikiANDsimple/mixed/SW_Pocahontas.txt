Pocahontas (born around 1595 â€“ buried on March 21, 1617) was an Native American woman who married an Englishman, John Rolfe, and became a celebrity in London right before she died. She was a daughter of Wahunsunacock (also known as Chief or Emperor Powhatan). He was the king of an area called the Tidewater region in Virginia (called Tenakomakah at the time) for a while. Her real names were Matoaka and Amonute. 'Pocahontas' was a childhood nickname referring to her playful nature. Some people think she saved John Smith's life. After her marriage she became officially Rebecca Rolfe. A movie was made about her in 1995 by Disney.
