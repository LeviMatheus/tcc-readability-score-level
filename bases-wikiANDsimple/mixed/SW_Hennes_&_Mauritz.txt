Hennes & Mauritz AB (H&M), is a Swedish clothing company. It is known for its cheap prices and fashionable clothing designs. The company was created in Västerås, Sweden, in 1947 by Erling Persson. At first, the company only sold women's clothing. At that time, it was called Hennes, Swedish for "hers." In 1968, Persson got the building and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. A supply of men's clothing was part of the inventory. This caused Persson to decide to also sell mens clothing. He renamed the store Hennes & Mauritz, later shortened to H&M. H&M has more than 1400 stores in 28 different countries. It has more than 60,000 employees.
