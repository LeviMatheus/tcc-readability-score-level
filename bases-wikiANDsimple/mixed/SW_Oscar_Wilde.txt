Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (October 16, 1854 – November 30, 1900) was an Irish playwright. He wrote "Salomé", "The Importance of Being Earnest", "An Ideal Husband", and "The Picture of Dorian Gray".
Wilde was a writer in the Victorian age. He was known for being part of the decadence trend of the late 19th century. Today, we know that Oscar Wilde was Gay or Bisexual. He went to prison for two years of hard labour because he had a sexual relationship with a younger man. This is believed to have contributed to his death at the age of 46.
