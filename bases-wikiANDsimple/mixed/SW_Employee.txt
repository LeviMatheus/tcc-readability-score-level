An employee is a term for workers and managers working for a company or an organisation. These people are the staff of the organization. Generally speaking any person hired by an employer to do a particular "job" is an employee.
In most modern economies the word "employee" means a person who works for a corporation. The relationship between employer and employee is different from that between the firm and a customer or client.
An employee usually gets the job after having an interview.
