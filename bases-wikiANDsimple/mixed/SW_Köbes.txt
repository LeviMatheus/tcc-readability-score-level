Köbes is a word from the Rhineland from local Ripuarian and Limburgish-Bergisch languages.
Informal meaning.
A Köbes is the waiter who serves the Kölsch beer in Cologne or who servers the Alt beer of Düsseldorf and Krefeld. One finds him only in brewery outlets and some specialized pubs.
Appearance.
Traditionally, a Köbes is dressed in blue, with a big leather belt and leather purse. If a guest sits down, the Köbes supplies beer, there is no order required. A Köbes continually replaces every empty glass with a full one, usually without asking. One must ask for the bill, or cover the glass, if you do not want more beer.
Expect Köbes to engage in short conversations or occasionally to tell, or make, jokes. Everyone can be subject of such jokes, the Köbes himself, his customers or other guests. If a Köbes includes them in jokes they do not hesitate to joke back on him.
