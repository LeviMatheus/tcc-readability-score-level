Kyle Thomas Busch (born May 2, 1985) is a NASCAR race car driver. He is frequently seen racing against his brother, "Kurt Busch". Busch is contracted to race in the NEXTEL Cup, Busch Series, as well as run select races in the Craftsman Truck Series.
In the 2007 season, Kyle is currently 6th in "NEXTEL Cup Series" points. Kyle Busch considers himself a master of the "Car of Tomorrow" and is hopeful to win the 2009 "Sprint Cup Championship". However, a decisive victory by Mr. Juan Pablo Montoya threatens this status at non-oval tracks.
Dale Earnhardt Jr. will replace Kyle Busch in the number 5 car starting in the 2008 season. Richard Childress Racing acquired his contract for the Busch Series, while Kyle will be driving a Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota in 2008 with M&Ms as a primary sponsor. His secondary sponors will include certain other candy and chocolate brands.
