"You Want It You Got It" is the second album by Bryan Adams, and was released in 1981 (see 1981 in music). The album was to be called "Bryan Adams Hasn't Heard Of You Either" but the record company wanted him to change the title to something safer.
The first single "Lonely Nights" was a big hit in the US, and two other singles 'Coming Home' and 'Fits Ya Good' were top 40 hits in Canada.
Many songs from this album were covered by other artists, they are "Lonely Nights" by Uriah Heep, "Jealousy" by Prism, "Tonight" by Randy Meisner and "Fits Ya Good" by Tove Naess and more others.
After Dave Taylor listened to this album, he decided to become Bryan Adams' bass player.
