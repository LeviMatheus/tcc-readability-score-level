An inventor is a person who creates new inventions, mostly new products that can be electrical, mechanical, or software. Someone that invents new ideas or methods on how to do things may also be called an inventor.
Many inventors make small changes to old inventions. For example, people have invented new ways to make clocks over history. Early clocks were sundials, later clocks used water. Later still, clocks used falling weights with escapements, devices like pendulums to stop the weight falling too fast. Modern clocks are often electronic.
