Squealer is a porker on Manor Farm in the book "Animal Farm". Squealer is a very fat little piglet, with round cheecks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, coupled together with a shrill voice. While arguing a difficult point, he skipped from side to side and whisk his tail around in a persuasive manner, allowing him to lie with ease.
Squeler is based on the Russia media of Stalin's time, and all the advertisement of Stalin.
