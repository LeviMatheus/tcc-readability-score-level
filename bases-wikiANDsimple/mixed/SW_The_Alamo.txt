The Alamo is an old Spanish Mission (like a church built by Catholic missionaries to minister to the natives) that is located in what is now San Antonio, Texas, USA. The Alamo was authorized in 1718 but was not built until 1744. The original name of the Alamo was San Antonio de Valero Mission.
The Alamo is most famous for The Battle of the Alamo, which took place in 1836. It was occupied by 187 men from Texas, and around the world who were fighting for the independence of Texas from Mexico. On March 6, 1836 the men in the Alamo were defeated by a force of 5,000 Mexican troops. All 187 men were killed, and "Remember the Alamo!" became the battle cry of the Texans for the rest of the war.
The Alamo became a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is open for tourists to see to this day.
