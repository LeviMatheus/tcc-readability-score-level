The Battle of Verdun was a battle of the First World War. It started when German troops attacked French positions, near Verdun, on February 21, 1916. It ended on December 20 of that year. The front line had not changed very much. Both sides lost about 337.000 soldiers each, about half of them died. Many historians see this battle as the bloodiest of World History. Never before was industrialisation so visible in war. They also speak about the "Hell of Verdun" or the "Blood pump".
