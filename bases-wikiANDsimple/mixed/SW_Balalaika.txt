The balalaika is a musical stringed instrument. It was first made in Russia. It has a wooden body and strings like a guitar or a mandolin. It looks different because it has a body shaped like a triangle.
There are many sizes of balalaika. Some are the size of a ukulele, but the biggest balalaikas can be as big as a person.
