Proportional representation is an idea from elections. Very often, parties are elected to some assembly. With proportional representation the number of seats of a certain party in the assembly will be in a direct relation to the number of votes (or the general success) that party had in the election. Usually, there is an additional restriction, that a certain minimum of votes must be reached, to be represented at all. Very often, this minimum is 5 %.
