Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel were an American pop music group. They were two childhood friends, who found fame in the 1960s. Their songs like "Mrs. Robinson", "The Sound of Silence", and "Bridge Over Troubled Water", all composed by Simon, are still popular to this day.
Their free concert in New York City's Central Park in 1981 was the biggest concert ever, with 500,000 people (about the same number as Woodstock).
