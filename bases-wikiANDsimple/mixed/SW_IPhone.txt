The iPhone is a mobile phone made by Apple Inc. At first, it was only for Cingular/AT&T customers in the United States, but Apple bought space with several network operators in Europe. Some people even know how to make it work with any GSM mobile provider (unlock it). This is disliked by Apple and will stop the warranty. The iPhone was first sold in the United States on June 29, 2007. It went on sale in Europe in November of that year. iPhone was released in Australia on June 13, 2008, along with about 40 other countries.
Functions.
You can do many different things with it (functions): mobile phone things, using some of the Internet, and iPod/multimedia functions. It is used by touching the item you want to use, on the screen. When the user needs to type something, for example a text message or a web address, a keyboard comes onto the screen so that they are able to type. The iPhone can also take pictures with the built-in camera or play a number of forms of media. Apple has added an SDK for the iPhone, which lets people make their own software for it.
iPhone 3G.
At the Apple World Wide Developers Conference, on 9 June 2008, a new iPhone was released. This newer version of the phone has a Global Positioning System (GPS) and has "3G" or "Third Generation" cellphone Internet speeds. 3G networking is more popular and is faster than previous cellphone Internet access. This version of the iPhone will be released in 42 countries around the world.
This version is $199, due to being subsidized. Being subsidized means the device is cheaper at the start, yet fees from monthly service charges will pay for the rest of the phone.
