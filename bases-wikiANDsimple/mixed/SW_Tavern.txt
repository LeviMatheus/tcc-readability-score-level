A tavern is a place where alcoholic drinks (such as beer, wine, or spirits) are served. While the word "tavern" used to be common in England, in the 19th century the word began to be seen as old fashioned. The current term today in England is "pub" which comes from "public house". However, taverns remain a popular part of fantasy stories and games. The term is still commonly used in the United States.
