The Lebanese Civil War (1975â€“1990) was a conflict that became greatly worse by Lebanon's changing demographic trends, Christian and Muslim inter-religious strife, and the involvement of Syria, Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). After a short break in the fighting in 1976 due to Arab League mediation and Syrian intervention, civil strife continued, with fighting primarily focused in south Lebanon, occupied first by the PLO, then occupied by Israel.
