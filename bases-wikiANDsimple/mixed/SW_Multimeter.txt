A multimeter or a multitester is an electronic measuring tool that is a combination of several tools in one unit. It usutally includes an ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter. Digital multimeters are sometimes called DMM too.
Modern multimeters can be used to measure electrical quantities other than current, resistance and voltage. For example, they can be used to measure frequency, capacitance and temperature.
