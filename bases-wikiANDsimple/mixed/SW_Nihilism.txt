Nihilism is the idea that life, or the world, has no meaning or purpose. Nihilists believe there is no higher being that created things and there are no true morals. It was conceived by Frederich Nietzsche,a German philosopher of the 19th century, who said that "God is dead." Combined with Marxist philosophies, Freudian analyses, and the despair felt by the "lost generation" of World War I, Nihilism became known as Modernism. Modernist artists and writers painted a bleak, materialistic view of the world, although some of them became post modernist.
It is the belief that we do not exist but are a mere product of our own imagination as the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche never said.
