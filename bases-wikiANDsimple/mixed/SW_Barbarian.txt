"Barbarian" is a pejorative word for an uncivilized, uncultured person.
It is used for a member of a nation or ethnic group which is seen as having an inferior level of civilization, or for an individual person which is seen as a brutal, cruel and insensitive or whose behaviour is unacceptable in the civilized society of the speaker. When used for a person the word is always pejorative, when used for a nation not always.
