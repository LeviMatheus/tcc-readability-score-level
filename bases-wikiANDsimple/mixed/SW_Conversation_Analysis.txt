Conversation analysis (commonly abbreviated as CA) is the study of talk in interaction. CA tries to describe the structure and patterns of interaction, whether this is institutional (in the school, doctor's surgery, courts or elsewhere) or casual conversation.
The term “conversation” to label this disciplinary movement is misleading if read in a colloquial sense, as many have.
