お好み焼き is a Japanese dish consisting of a pan-fried batter cake and various ingredients. "Okonomi" means "what you like" or "what you want", and "yaki" means "grilled" or "cooked" (cf. "yakitori" and "yakisoba"); thus, the name of this dish means "cook what you like". In Japan, okonomiyaki is mainly associated with Kansai or Hiroshima, but is widely available throughout the country.
