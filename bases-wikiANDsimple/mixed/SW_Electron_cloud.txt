In chemistry and nuclear physics, the electron cloud is a way to describe where electrons are when they go around the nucleus of an atom. The electron cloud model is different from the older model by Niels Bohr. Bohr talked about electrons going around the nucleus in a fixed circle, the same way that planets go around the Sun. The electron cloud model says that we can't know exactly where an electron is, but the electrons are more likely to be in specific areas of an atom.
