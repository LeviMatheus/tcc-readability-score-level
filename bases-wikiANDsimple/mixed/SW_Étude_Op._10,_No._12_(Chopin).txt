The Étude Op. 10, No. 12 in C minor, also known as the The Revolutionary Étude, is a piano solo etude composed by Frederic Chopin in the early 1830's. Probably one of Chopin's most well-known pieces, this etude emphasizes the left-hand work that plays fast uninterrupted arpeggios of semi-quavers (about 1300 notes played by the left hand during the whole piece). The right-hand, technically less difficult, plays the main theme which consists in a series of complex chords.
