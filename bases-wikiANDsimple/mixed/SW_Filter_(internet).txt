A filter is a website feature that removes some kinds of content. This can be to stop the user viewing the unwanted content. It can also be to stop the user posting content the site does not want. Internet filters most often work by stopping certain words being used. Filters to stop other content, such as certain kinds of pictures, can also be used. A filter can be used to only stop a certain kind of user seeing the content, children for example.
