Imaginary numbers, represented by "i", are defined as formula_1. (They are not negative, as a negative number squared is always "positive"; an imaginary number squared is always "negative") Imaginary numbers don't have a "true" meaning, in that you can't have 2"i" apples, but they are just as mathematically correct as any other number we are familiar with.
Imaginary numbers can be 'mixed' with numbers we are more familiar with. For example a whole number such as the number '2' can be added to an imaginary number such as '3i' to create '2+3i'. These kinds of 'mixed' numbers are known as complex numbers.
Imaginary numbers and complex numbers are very useful in higher math, including calculus and circuit analysis, and are used in algebra to find all the possible roots (or solutions) of an equation.
