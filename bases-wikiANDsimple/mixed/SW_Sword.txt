A sword is a hand-held weapon made of metal. It has a long blade, and a handle called a hilt. Often there is some form of hand protection, such as a cross-guard or a basket. It can be used either for cutting, slashing or stabbing, depending on the type of sword.
There are many kinds of swords. One kind of sword is a "sabre" (or "saber"). A sabre is a curved, light, sword, sharpened on one side and at the tip, and was generally used on horseback. A "broadsword" is a long sword that is sharp on both sides and at the tip. Another type of sword is a "foil", used in the sport of fencing, and is long, and thin, with a button at the tip to protect the fencers from injury. Larger swords, such as great swords or claymores are used with two hands.
Swords were first created from bronze by blacksmiths in Ancient Egypt around 2500 BC. Soon other cultures adopted them, and they began to spread quite quickly. Before guns were invented, swords were much more common as a weapon. After the invention of the gun, swords remained as "sidearms", as secondary weapons used in man-to-man fight once the battle lines had contacted after shooting. Since after American Civil War, swords have not been used as much by armies, except as a ceremonial part of uniforms. Some guns, however, have bayonets to perform the same function.
Today, swordplay, known as fencing, is an Olympic games sport. Likewise, the Japanese sport kendo is swordplay in armour with two-handed bamboo swords.
