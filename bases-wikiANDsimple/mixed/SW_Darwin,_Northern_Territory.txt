Darwin is the territorial capital of the Northern Territory in Australia. The city has about 100,000 people living there.
Most of Darwin has been built since 1974, when Cyclone Tracy ripped through and destroyed the city. Since then, the city has recovered. It is a very important port, because it is on the coast closest to Indonesia and the rest of Asia. Darwin also has a large military base.
Darwin also has a big number of Indigenous Australians, more than any other capital city of Australia.
