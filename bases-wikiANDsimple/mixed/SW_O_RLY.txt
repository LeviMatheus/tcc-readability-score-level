O RLY? is an Internet meme often used in chat rooms or fora. It is short for Oh, really?. O RLY is used as a response to an above post or comment to show (sarcastically) that it is obvious, clear, or apparent. O RLY? is usually followed by YA RLY?, then NO WAI. This sarcasm is not to be confused with trolling, disrupting a forum, or a chat room. The meme has spread on many forums, across the Internet.
