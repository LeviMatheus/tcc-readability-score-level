Kinshasa is the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (once called Zaire). It is the third largest city in the continent of Africa (after Lagos and Cairo). Seven and a half million people live there. Kinshasa is also a province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city of Kinshasa is located in it.
Henry Morton Stanley started the town in 1881 and called it Léopoldville (after King Léopold II of Belgium), next to a village called Nshasa or Kinshasa. The city of Léopoldville changed its name to Kinshasa in 1966.
Kinshasa is on one side of the Congo river, and Brazzaville, the capital of the Republic of Congo, is on the other side. Kinshasa and Brazzaville are the nearest country capitals in the world.
