The World Chess Championship is played to choose the World Champion in the board game chess. Both men and women can become champion. Before 1886, there was no official championship held, and from 1948 on, the world chess federation FIDE held the championships. Between 1993 and 2006 there were two world champion titles, the FIDE one and the classical one.
