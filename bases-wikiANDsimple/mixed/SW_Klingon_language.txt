The Klingon language (named "tlhIngan Hol" in Klingon) is a language that was made for the Klingons in the "Star Trek" universe. It is an invented language. This means that there is no country that uses the language. Only few people can really speak the Klingon language. The Klingon Language Institute helps people learn Klingon.
History.
The first Klingon words were made by the actor James Doohan in 1979 for the first Star Trek movie. When they made the third movie in 1984, Gene Roddenberry wanted to have a real language for the Klingons. So it was the linguist (a language scientist) Marc Okrand who made the Klingon language. He has written some books about the Klingon language.
Grammar.
The Klingon language feels like talking backwards. Marc Okrand wanted the language to be as complicated as possible. He did this to make it sound very extraterrestrial. The word order in a sentence is always object-verb-subject. So the English sentence "I see the cat" is said as "the cat see I" in Klingon.
