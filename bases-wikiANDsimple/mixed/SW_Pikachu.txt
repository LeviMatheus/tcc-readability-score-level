Pikachu is a small yellow animal from the fictional Pokémon world that was created by Satoshi Tajiri. Pikachu is an electric Pokémon. It can attack other Pokémon using electricity. It can evolve (change its type) into Raichu, which is bigger and stronger. A pre-evolved form of Pikachu is called Pichu, and is much smaller and weaker than Pikachu. The only sounds Pikachu makes are "Pi", "Ka" and "Chu". However, Pikachu makes noises possibly as his way of talking. He also has a battle cry for when he uses his thunderbolt attack.
Pikachu is the best known of all of the Pokémon because it is the unofficial mascot of the series. It is also one of the main stars of the Pokémon cartoon and comic books. On one of the first Pokémon games, "Pokémon Yellow", it is the player's starter Pokémon.
In the "Pokémon" TV series, the trainer Ash Ketchum's first Pokemon is a Pikachu. At first it doesn't like him, but then he saves it from some Spearow and their friendship steadily grows from there.
