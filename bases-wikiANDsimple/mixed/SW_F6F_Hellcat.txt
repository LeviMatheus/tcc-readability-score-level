The F6F Hellcat was an American World War II fighter aircraft made by Grumman. It first flew in 1942 and was introduced in 1943. It was supposed to be a little bit better than the F4F Wildcat, but became a big improvement. It was more powerful and could turn better. This was supposed to fight the Japanese A6M Zero. It was able to take off of aircraft carriers. It was also used by the navy as a "night fighter", which means that a radar was put on it so it could fly at night. During the war, it had the most aces fly it. It was retired in 1954.
