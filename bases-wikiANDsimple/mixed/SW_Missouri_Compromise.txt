The Missouri Compromise, also called the Compromise of 1820, was a plan proposed by Henry Clay of the U.S. state of Kentucky. The plan admitted Missouri as a slave state to please the South. Maine was admitted as a free state to please the North. It kept the balance of power in the United States Senate between the free states and slave states. The plan also called for slavery to be banned from the Louisiana Territory north of the parallel 36 degrees 30'(also known as the Missouri Compromise Line), Missouri's southern border. The plan was signed by former President Monroe and passed in 1820.
