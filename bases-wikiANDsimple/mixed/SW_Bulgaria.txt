History.
For 500 years, Bulgaria was ruled by the Ottoman Empire. Throughout most of the 20th century, its foreign policy was influenced by the Soviet Union. In the early 1990s, as the Soviet Union began to collapse, Bulgaria grew more independent of Soviet policy.
Within a few years of the fall of the Berlin Wall, Bulgaria had serious economic problems, and the socialist government that took power after the communists fell in 1989. But since then, Bulgaria has rebounded well. After some real economic reform and responsible money planning, the government has become more stable. Problems in the administration, a weak court system and organised crime are the biggest issues for Bulgaria.
