Many people of many different ages join Neopets. The site has many games that the user can play. Neopets has a help section to find answers to many of the questions that users may have.
Avatars.
Avatars are small, animated 50x50 pixel boxes. They can be used on chat boards and guilds. They can be used to show a user's personality, what they are good at, or how they are feeling. There are three types of avatars: default, clickable, and avatars that have to be earned.
Default avatars.
Default avatars are the easiest type of avatar to get. Once a person creates an account on Neopets, they get to use the default avatars without having to do anything. Default avatars are mainly the different pets that can be used on the site and certain faeries.
Clickable avatars.
Clickable avatars are the second easiest avatar to get. To earn a Clickable, the user must go to a certain place on the site. Once the user has gone to that page, they get a message that says they can use that avatar.
Avatars that are earned.
Many avatars have to be earned. These are the avatars that people want most. These avatars are the hardest to get. These avatars may be gotten in many different ways. For example, getting a certain score in a game, buying a specific item, or getting a set amount of "Neo-points" (the money used on the site).
Fan sites.
There are many websites created by Neopet users to help other players. These sites help with information about how to play games and how to get avatars. There are also many sites for users to find ways to change the look of the pages that tell about themselves and their pets.
