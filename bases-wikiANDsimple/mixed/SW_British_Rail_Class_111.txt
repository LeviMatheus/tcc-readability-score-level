The Class 111 DMUs were based on 2s, but with different engines. The only external body difference was on the final batch of cars where a four character headcode box was fitted above the front cab windows, with the destination indicator on top of a reduced height centre window.
The first cars built, part of an order for 339 Met-Camm cars, were 4 power/trailer sets for the LMR Manchester area built in early 1957. One of these was equipped with supercharged 230 hp 6-cylinder engines. This was followed by ten 3-car sets comprising DMBS/TS/DMC for the NER at Bradford, then a further twenty 3-car sets.
