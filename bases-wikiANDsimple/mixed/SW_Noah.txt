Noah is a religious figure in Judeo-Christian and Islamic religious text. The story of Noah and his ark is a very popular biblical story.
The Story of Noah's Ark.
As described in the Book of Genesis, Noah and his family kept believing in God in a time when most people were not. Knowing this was true, God told Noah he was going to flood the world, so he could drown out evil. He told Noah to build a boat called an "Ark". He was to put himself, his family, and two (a male and a female) of every kind of animal on it. People laughed at Noah at first, but soon they were killed by the flood. The people on the ark stayed on the boat not only until the flood was over, but until they reached land. To find land Noah had sent out a dove, which returned with an olive branch. This showed that they were close to land. After the flood, God made a rainbow to say he would never do something like the flood again to Earth.
