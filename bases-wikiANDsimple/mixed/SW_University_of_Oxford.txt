The University of Oxford is a university located in Oxford in the United Kingdom. It is the oldest university of all those in countries where English is the people's first language.
The university consists of 38 colleges and another 6 "private halls". All of these colleges have their own buildings and their own staff, making Oxford quite different from most modern universities where all the students live on a "campus". Oxford does not have a campus, although it does have some central places where students from different colleges can come together either to study (for example, libraries) or to enjoy themselves (for example, the Oxford Union).
History.
Many people who study history think that there was a university in Oxford in the 11th century, and the University of Oxford grew bigger in 1167, after English students studying in Paris, France were not allowed to continue studying after the murder of St Thomas Becket by King Henry II of England. There were fights between the students in Oxford and the people who lived there in the early 13th century. Some students and teachers left the university in 1209, and made a new university in Cambridge. These two universities are now great rivals, and together are sometimes known as "Oxbridge".
Until 1920, women were not allowed to take degrees at Oxford, although some women studied at Oxford before that time. Nowadays almost all the colleges allow both men and women as students, and the number of male and female students is roughly equal.
One of the most famous professors at university was Lewis Carroll, author of "Alice in Wonderland" and "Through the Looking-Glass", nonsense stories for children.
Getting into Oxford.
Oxford, like Cambridge, is very popular with students, and therefore it is harder for students to get into these universities. The colleges look for the students with the best school results in the subjects for which they are applying for.
