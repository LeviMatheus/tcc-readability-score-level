Rabbi (in the Hebrew classic רִבִּי "ribbi"; in the Hebrew modern רַבִּי "rabbi") in Judaism signifies "professor, master" or literally "grand". The word "Rabbi" ("My Master") derives from the Hebrew root "Rav", that in the Hebrew biblical signifies "grand" or "distinct" (in knowledge).
In the Judaism, Rabbi is a title used in order to distinguish the one that teaches, the one that has the authority of the doctors of the Torah or that one pointed by the religious leaders of the community. Today the rabbis are responsible for the education and for application of the teachings of the Judaism. In contrast to other religions, the rabbi is not a priest, not being strictly necessary for finishing successfully the majority of the acts of the cycle of Jewish life, as the marriage, bar-mitzvá, burials, etc. The only acts that demand the participation of a rabbi are the "get" (divorce) and litigations that demand the decision of a rabbinical court.
However, in our days, to a great extent of the secularization of the Jewish community, the rabbis assumed the role of the person who directs most of the religious ceremonies. Nevertheless, in the Judaism there is not the figure of the "representative of God" or of a person with a special contact with God, therefore each individual is considered as endowed with a direct connection with God.
