Louis XIV (Louis-Dieudonné) (5 September 1638–1 September 1715) was the King of France and King of Navarre from 14 May 1643 until his death.
While he became king on May 14, 1643, he was only four years old so he had to wait 16 years until he could rule. He was 21 years old when he started ruling.
Louis' parents were Louis XIII and Anne of Austria. Because Louis XIV was too young to rule, his mother ruled France with Cardinal Mazarin until Louis turned 21. He was known as the Sun King, because he believed his splendor and power was as bright as the sun.
Louis revoked, or ended, the Treaty of Nantes. This Treaty said that there would be freedom of religion in France. This means that everybody in France could worship the way they wanted to. When Louis revoked the Treaty of Nantes, he said that all people in France must be Catholic. Because of this, 50 thousand Protestant workers left France and went to America, England, and Germany.
While Louis ruled, France became the most powerful country in all of Europe, and many other countries copied the French people's way of dressing and thinking. Louis found a hunting lodge at Versailles, and changed it into a palace for him and his noblemen to live in. He also encouraged people to explore Canada, and tried very hard to make France larger. Louis spent a lot of money on wars, and France went into deep debt because of him.
French kings after Louis XIV taxed a lot of money from the poor people to try and pay off the debt. This is part of what led to the French Revolution.
