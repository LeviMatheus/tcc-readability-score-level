Daylight saving time (DST) is the local time adopted by many countries during summer. Typically, clocks are adjusted by moving the time forward by one hour in late winter or early spring. When DST ends in autumn, clocks are turned back to their the normal time.
DST was introduced in many countries to use the extra daylight available during summer. DST helps stores that sell to people after they get off work, but it hurts farmers and others whose hours are set by the sun. It cuts traffic accident rates. Sometimes it can reduce energy costs, but it can also increase them.
The United States, Australia (not Queensland or Western Australia), the United Kingdom, Canada and many other countries have DST. In Europe, DST is called summer time. Iceland and Kazakhstan are the only countries in Europe without DST.
