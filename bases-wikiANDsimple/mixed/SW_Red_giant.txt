A red giant is a very big star that does not weigh very much. Red giants usually burn helium. Red giants are very large, and many can fit many thousands of suns inside them. red giants get their name because they appear to be red. Some red giants are Mira, Aldebaran, Arcturus, and Gamma Crucis. One day, 5 billion years from now, the sun will become a red giant and become so big it will swallow up Mercury, Venus, and even the Earth. When it does, it will become 200 times bigger than it is now.
