A lens is a piece of glass or clear (transparent) plastic that changes the way things look, when you look at them through the lens. They may appear larger than they are, or smaller, or in a different shape. Lenses are used in spectacles (glasses) that people wear on their noses when they cannot see well without them. They are also used in cameras for taking pictures, and in binoculars, telescopes, microscopes, and magnifying glasses. A projector is an application of lens too. You even find lenses in your eyes.
