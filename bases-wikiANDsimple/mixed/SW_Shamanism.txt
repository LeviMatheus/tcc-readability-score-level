Shamanism is the name for a number of religious movements. Originally, it was used by Europeans to describe different religious and magical movements they could observe with certain indigenous people in Siberia, from about the 17th century. In the 20th century, the word was also used to describe other, similar movements worldwide.
Shamans play a central role in these movements, as they can be in both worlds, this one, and the world of spirits.
Shamanism is different form animism or animatism. Unlike these, it is not an organised movement.
