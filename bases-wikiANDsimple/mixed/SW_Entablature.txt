An entablature (IPA [ɛnˈtæblətʃə]; Latin, "and tabula", "a tablet") is a major element of classical architecture, the superstructure of moldings and bands which lies horizontally above the columns, resting on their capitals. Entablature is commonly divided into the architrave—the supporting member carried from column to column, pier or wall immediately above; the frieze—an unmolded strip that may or may not be ornamented; and the cornice, the projecting member below the pediment.
