The Book of Joshua is the sixth book of the Christian Bible, and also the sixth book of the Hebrew Tanakh. It is unclear who wrote the book, but most of the Jewish tradition, believe it was Joshua. It is the first of the books of the Tanakh (Old Testament), covering the history of Israel from the arrival in the Promised Land to the Babylonian captivity.
It is thought that the book was written around the 15th or 13th century B.C.
