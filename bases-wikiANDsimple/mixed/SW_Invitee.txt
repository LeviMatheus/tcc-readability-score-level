In tort law, an invitee is a member of the public who has been invited to do business with the owner of a property. For example, if someone owns a store and invites someone else to come into the store to buy something, the person who is invited is an "invitee".
In some places (or jurisdictions), tort law asks whether a person is an invitee when it decides what duty the owner of land has to keep that person safe from harm.
