The African Wildcats ("Felis sylvestris lybica") are small, fierce cats that live in forests, grasslands, and brush lands in Africa and the Middle East.
Description.
African Wildcats are generally nocturnal (most active at night) in warm weather but are diurnal (most active during the day) during very cold weather. They are excellent climbers. African Wildcats have a life span of 12-15 years. They are about 50 percent larger than domesticated (tame) cats.
Diet.
African Wildcats are carnivores (meat-eaters). These fast, solitary hunters eat small to medium-sized mammals, birds, reptiles, frogs, invertebrates, and eggs.
