Belinda is a closer moon to Uranus. Belinda was found from the images taken by "Voyager 2" on 1986-01-13, and was given the designation S/1986 U 5. It is named after the heroine of Alexander Pope's "The Rape of the Lock". It is also designated Uranus XIV.
Belinda belongs to Portia Group of moons, which also includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Portia, Juliet, Cupid, Rosalind and Perdita. These moons have similar orbits and photometric properties. Unfortunately, other than its orbit, radius of 45 km and geometric albedo of 0.08 almost nothing is known about it.
At the Voyager 2 images Belinda appears as a stretched object, the major axis pointing towards Uranus. The moon is very stretched, with its short axis 0.5 ± 0.1 times the long axis. Its surface is grey in color.
