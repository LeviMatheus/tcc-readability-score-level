This list of smuggling in fiction includes works of fiction (in both prose and poetry) where smuggling is a prominent theme. Smuggling is a common trope or theme in literature and can be found in a wide range of works – from the 18th century novels of Charlotte Turner Smith to Prosper Mérimée's 19th century novella, "Carmen" (the inspiration for numerous films as well as Bizet's opera, "Carmen") to the James Bond novel (and later film) "Diamonds are Forever".
