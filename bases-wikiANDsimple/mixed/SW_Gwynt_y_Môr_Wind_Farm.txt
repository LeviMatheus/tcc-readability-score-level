Gwynt y Môr is a proposed 750 MW offshore wind farm located off the coast of North Wales. Planning applications for the project were submitted in 2005 and construction is expected to start in 2010.
Gwynt y Môr would be Wales largest wind farm; capable of powering 500,000 homes, or 40% of the homes in Wales, and preventing the release of over 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year.
The proposed wind farm is located in close proximity to the existing North Hoyle offshore wind farm and the Rhyl Flats offshore wind farm, which is now under construction. All of these projects are owned by npower renewables.
