A soldier is someone who is a part of an army.
If people fight in "irregular forces" (forces not wearing a uniform, and not part of the official military of a nation), they are called partisans if they fight against another nation's army, or terrorists, if they fight civilians.
Partisans and terrorists are protected by the law to a lesser degree than soldiers.
Soldiers can be volunteers or conscripts (their nation calls upon them to fight).
