A calendar is a system for assigning calendar dates to days. The "dates" may be based on how things in the sky seem to move, like the Sun or moon.
A calendar is also something (often paper) that shows the system in writing (for example, a "desktop calendar").
The term is also used to mean a set of planned events (for example, "court calendar"). The calendar most commonly used by people in the Western world is the Gregorian Calendar.
