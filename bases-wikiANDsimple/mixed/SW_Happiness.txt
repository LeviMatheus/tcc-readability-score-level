Happiness is a feeling of pleasure and satisfaction. When someone feels good, proud, relieved or satisfied about something, that person may be described as "happy". Feeling happy may help people to relax and to smile.
Happiness is usually thought of as the opposite of sadness, but it is possible to feel both at once.
Many philosophers have said that people in this world go back and forth between times of happiness and sadness, but there is nobody who is always happy or always sad.
