Daisuke Takahashi is a figure skater from Japan. He won the Japanese national championships in 2006 and 2007.
Takahashi is the first male skater from Japan to win the World Junior Championships and the first male skater from Japan to win a silver medal at the World Championship.
Takahashi went to the 2006 Olympics and placed 8th.
Takahashi is known as a graceful skater and a very good spinner. He has very good basic skating skills and a quadruple jump, making him a top skater in the world. In his career, he has known to be very inconsistent, often choking (doing badly under pressure) at big events. But in 2006-2007 season, he overcame this reputation and did very well, placing 1st or 2nd at every event he entered.
