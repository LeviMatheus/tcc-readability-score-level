The CFP franc (usually just called "franc") is the currency used in the some of France's overseas colonies (French Polynesia, New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna). The initials "CFP" originally stood for "Colonies fran√ßaises du Pacifique" ("French colonies of the Pacific") but now officially stand for "Change Franc Pacifique" ("Pacific Franc Exchange").
