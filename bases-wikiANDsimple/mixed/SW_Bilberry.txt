The bilberry is a type of shrub that grows close to the ground. It is a member of the genus Vaccinium.
The bilberry is known by many names. It also called blaeberry, whortleberry, whinberry, myrtle blueberry, fraughan, and probably other names in different regions of the world. In Thomas Hardy's 1878 book, "The Return of the Native," they were called black-hearts in 19th century southern England. They are related
to the North American blueberries and huckleberries.
