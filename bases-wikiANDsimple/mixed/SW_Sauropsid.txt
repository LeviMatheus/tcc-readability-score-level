Sauropsids are a diverse group of vertebrate animals. Most of them lay eggs. The Sauropsida includes all modern and most extinct "reptiles", but excludes synapsids. Living sauropsids include lizards, snakes, turtles, crocodiles, and birds. Extinct sauropsids include non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and many others.
