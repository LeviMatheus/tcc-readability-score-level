An Apple Macintosh or just Mac is a type of computer. It was first made by Apple in January 1984, and the brand continues to this day. The people who made the Macintosh and Mac OS (operating system) wanted computers to be simpler. Some of these people liked a Xerox computer. The Macintosh was the first popular computer where people could click things on a screen.
The newest version of Mac OS is called Mac OS X. It is based on Unix. New Macintosh computers can have Linux, Unix, Windows, or BeOS on them.
