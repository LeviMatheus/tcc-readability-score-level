Pine is a type of a evergreen tree. It is a genus in the "Pinaceae" family of the conifer division ("Pinophyta"). Pine has many uses most commonly being used in furniture. This is because of the natural durability and attractive appearance of the wood. The wood that comes from it is also called pine. Pine is a softwood and we would call it conferious. All softwoods take up to 10-20 years to grow which is why they are a lot easier to use in furniture because they grow quicker than deciduous (hardwood) trees which take 90-100 years to grow.
