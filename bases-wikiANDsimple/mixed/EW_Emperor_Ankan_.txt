Legendary narrative.
According to the "Kojiki", , later Emperor Ankan, was the elder son of Emperor Keitai, who is considered to have ruled the country during the early-6th century, though there is a paucity of information about him. When Ankan was 66 years old, Keitai abdicated in favor of him.

Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Ankan might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".
