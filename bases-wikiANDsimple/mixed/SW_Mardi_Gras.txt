Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday) is a festival held two days before Ash Wednesday, signifying the end of the Carnival season and the start of Lent. Many cities (especally those with large Catholic populations) like New Orleans are famous for their Mardi Gras. During Mardi Gras, almost everyone takes part in celebrating with lavish parades and parties.
