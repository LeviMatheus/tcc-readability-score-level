Liu-bo is an Italian martial art. It started in Sicily.
History.
In Sicily, the art of "paranza", moving the stick by hand in order to attack or in order to defend oneself, was being taught to sons by their fathers for centuries. Many people who took care of sheep were masters of it. They often were asked to fight in order to decide problems of honor. Recently, rules have been created and it was made a sport. This sport has become well-known and has been made official by the National Educational Sport Center (CSEN).
The stick.
The stick is made from the wood of olive, rowan, or bitter orange tree. It is used as a base for a number of actions. It is held in one or both hands.
