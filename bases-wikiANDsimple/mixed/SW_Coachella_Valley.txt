The Coachella Valley is a desert valley in the Colorado Desert of Southern California. It is famous as a resort destination and an agricultural region.
Many people visit the area and enjoy the pleasant weather during tourist season, which is from September to June. Winter in the Coachella Valley is very pleasant, much like spring in other parts of the country. Summer is very hot and dry, with temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Centigrade. Although the area is a desert, there are lots of water both under the ground and in aqueducts from the Colorado River. The weather is so similar to weather in the Middle East that the area grows more than 95% of the nation's crop of dates. A grapefruit called the "Coachella Grapefruit" was first grown there.
One of the world's greatest engineering feats is in Palm Springs. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway brings visitors from the floor of the valley to the top of Mount San Jacinto, 8516 feet (3000 metres) up!
