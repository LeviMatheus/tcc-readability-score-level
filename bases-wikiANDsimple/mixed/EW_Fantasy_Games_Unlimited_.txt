Fantasy Games Unlimited (FGU) is a publishing house for tabletop and role-playing games. The company has no in-house design teams and relies on submitted material from outside talent.
History.
Founded in the summer of 1975 in Jericho, New York by Scott Bizar, the company's first publications were the wargames "Gladiators" and "Royal Armies of the Hyborean Age". Upon the sudden appearance and massive popularity of "Dungeons &amp; Dragons" from TSR, the company turned its attentions to role-playing games, seeking out and producing systems created by amateurs and freelancers. Rather than focusing on any one line and supporting it with subsequent supplements, FGU produced a continuous stream of new games. Because of the disparate authors, the rules systems were mutually incompatible. FGU Incorporated published dozens of different role-playing games.
Fantasy Games Unlimited won the All Time Best Ancient Medieval Rules for 1979 H.G. Wells Award at Origins 1980 for "Chivalry &amp; Sorcery".
In 1991, Fantasy Games Unlimited Inc. was dissolved as a New York corporation. Bizar continues to publish in Arizona as a sole proprietorship called Fantasy Games Unlimited.
A new FGU website appeared in July 2006 offering the company's back catalog. It said that new products would be "coming soon". New "Aftermath!" products began to appear in 2008. By 2010 much of the company's back catalog was available. At that time FGU was seeking submissions to allow the publication of new adventures for some of their existing titles, primarily "Aftermath!, Space Opera, and Villains and Vigilantes".
