History.
Mainland Tanzania (formerly Tanganyika) received independence in December 1961 while Zanzibar gained her independence in January 1964 through a revolution. The two countries united to form the United Republic of Tanzania in April 1964. Until July 1992, Tanzania was a one-party state. Following recommendations by a Presidential Commission, the country has adopted a multi-party political system, and has held a successful General Election in 1995 and 2000.
