Plant cutting, also known as striking/cloning, is a technique for vegetatively (asexually) propagating plants. With this method, a piece of the source plant containing at least one stem cell is placed in a suitable medium such as moist soil, potting mix, coir or rock wool. The cutting then grows new roots, stems, or both, and becomes a new plant independent of the parent.
