An Easter egg is an egg, eaten and used for decoration during the Easter holidays.
Easter eggs are bird eggs, usually chicken eggs, that have been colorfully painted. In modern times chocolate eggs with a colorful wrapping are also used.
Where this tradition comes from is unclear. Most likely it comes from a pagan fertility ritual during spring.
An easter egg also refers to a secret program in a computer put in by programmers and got fired for doing so. For example, by putting "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl" in the command prompt of a Windows computer, you'll get a Star Wars(Episode IV) video made of little lines, letters, numbers etc.
