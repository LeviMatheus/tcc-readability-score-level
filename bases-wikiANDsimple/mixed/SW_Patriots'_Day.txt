Patriots' Day (sometimes spelled Patriot's Day or Patriots Day) is a legal holiday in Massachusetts. The holiday remembers the American men and women who fought during the Revolutionary War.
In the past, Patriots' Day was on April 19, in honor of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the American Revolutionary War, which were fought on that date in 1775. Since 1969, however, the holiday has been on the third Monday in April.
The Boston Marathon is run on this day every year. Also, the Boston Red Sox have played a home game at Fenway Park on this day every year since 1960.
