The Original Sin refers to Adam and Eve in the religious book The Bible, who broke God's order not to eat the forbidden fruit because they doubted God and were persuaded by the snake to eat it. After this, they were removed from the Garden of Eden. Because of this Christianity believe all humans are born in the original sin.
