The British Rail Class 951 was reserved for former diesel-electric multiple units converted for departmental use. Units were converted for various tasks, including application of sandite, de-icing duties, and use as tractor units to tow other trains. This classification is now obsolete, as all units have either been withdrawn, or renumbered into the Class 930 range.
