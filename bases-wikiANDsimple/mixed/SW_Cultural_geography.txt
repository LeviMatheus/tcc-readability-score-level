Cultural Geography is the study of cultures, customs, foods, clothing, music, architecture, traditions, religions and languages of the world - and how and why these cultures are spread across the world.
An example would be the Arab World, there are many nations inhabited by Arabic people, from Morocco in the north-west of Africa and lies near to Spain, to Syria which borders Turkey - and Yemen which is near to Ethiopia.
