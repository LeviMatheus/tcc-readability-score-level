Computer numbering formats are the ways that computers and calculators represent numbers. Most computers use a system of binary which is composed of ones and zeros.
Other systems in use are the octal (0,1-7) and the hexadecimal (0,1-9,A,B,C,D,E,F) systems.
Now we can use codes which the computer understands only, as well as other number systems.
