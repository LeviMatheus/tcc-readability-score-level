History.
The city was first founded by the British in 1827. They paid Spain for use of the island during colonial times. The British named the city Port Clarence. It was used as a naval station help stop the slave trade. Many newly freed slaves settled there before the creation of Sierra Leone as a colony for freed slaves. While many of them later moved to Sierra Leone.
When the island returned to Spanish control, Malabo was renamed Santa Isabel. It replaced the town of Bata as the capital of the country in 1969. The city was renamed Malabo in 1973 because President Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema wanted to replace European place names with "authentic" African ones.
