Sight is one of the senses. Having sight means to be able to see. Seeing gives animals knowledge of the world. Light from the world around the animal carries this knowledge in colors and pictures of shapes. The light enters the animal's eyes. At the back of the eyes, there are cells that get the knowledge from the light.
The animal's brain helps the animal use this knowledge. The brain is able to find out the shapes and colors of objects. From that and from memory it can tell of what kind the object is. For example, it can tell a tree from a house. The path on which this kind of information flows is called "ventral stream".
The brain can also tell where objects are. For example, it can can tell how far away an object is. This is needed when catching a ball. The path on which this kind of information flows is called "dorsal stream".
