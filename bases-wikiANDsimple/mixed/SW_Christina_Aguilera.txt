Christina Maria Aguilera (born December 18, 1980), sometimes known under the stage name Xtina is an American pop singer and song-writer. She is of Hispanic descent. She was born in Staten Island New York. Aguilera made her debut on the Ed McMahon show "Star Search" in 1990 and, three years later, starred on "The New Mickey Mouse Club". She was signed to RCA Records after making the song "Reflection" for the film Mulan.
Her first album Christina Aguilera (1999) was a success. It earned her a Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2000. Aguilera made two other albums then. They were a Latin pop album "Mi Reflejo", and a Christmas album "My Kind of Christmas". They both sold well and Mi Reflejo won a Latin Grammy Award.
Aguilera had more control over her second album "Stripped", sent to stores in 2002. It had mixed reviews and earned Aguilera a Grammy Award. But her very sexual image at the time was looked down on. Her third album "Back to Basics" (2006) mixed parts of soul, jazz and blues music. It was given good sales and reviews. It also earned Aguilera her fourth Grammy Award.
