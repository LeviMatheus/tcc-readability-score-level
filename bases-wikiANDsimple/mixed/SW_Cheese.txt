Cheese is usually made using milk. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in a large pots and add salt and a substance from the stomach of young cows called rennet. This curdles the cheese, it makes it solid. There are special pots for making cheese. Often, these pots are called "vats". Some makers do not add rennet and curdle it in other ways. One way which factories use is using bacteria. Other ingredients are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time.
