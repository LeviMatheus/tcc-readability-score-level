A sleep disorder is unhealthy sleep. There are many sleep disorders, and some of them are very serious. A test commonly ordered for some sleep disorders is the polysomnogram.
Classifications of sleep disorders.
Dysomnias are a broad category of sleep disorders which cause too much or too little sleep. Some of these are caused within the body while some are externally caused.
For example, insomnia and narcolepsy are two of the dysomnias.
Circadian rhythm sleep disorders cause sleeping at abnormal times: too early, too late or not regularly. People with these disorders can usually get enough sleep, just at the "wrong" time of day. These disorders are sometimes included among the dysomnias.
Parasomnias are doing things not normally done while sleeping, without conscious knowledge of what one is doing. They include walking, eating, dressing, bedwetting and other events.
Medical or psychiatric conditions may also cause trouble sleeping. People with depression or alcoholism may sleep poorly.
Common causes of sleep disorders.
Changes in life style, such as shift work change or travelling over several time zones, can contribute to sleep disorders.
Treatment.
A sleep diary or log can be used to help diagnose (define) the problem. It can also be used to measure improvements.
According to Dr. William Dement of the Stanford Sleep Center, anyone who snores and is sleepy in the daytime should see a doctor about sleep disorders.
In case of chronic pain, both the pain and the sleep problems should be treated. Pain can lead to sleep problems and vice versa.
The choice of a treatment for a sleep disorder depends on the patient's diagnosis, his/her medical and psychiatric history, and how she or he prefers to be treated. Medications sometimes work fast. On the other hand, sometimes behavioral treatment of insomnia may give more lasting results.
