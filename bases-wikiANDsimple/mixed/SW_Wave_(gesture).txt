Wave is a movement of the hand that people use to greet each other when they have just seen each other or are about to leave. A wave is made when a person raises his or her arm and moves it from side to side. Another common variation of the wave is done by holding the hand out as if to say "STOP" and bending the fingers down to the palm over and over.
