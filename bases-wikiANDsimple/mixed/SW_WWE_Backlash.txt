Backlash is an yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by World Wrestling Entertainment, which started in 1999 and is held in April (but 2005 wasn't). 2004 to 2006, Raw superstars only apperared at Backlash.
The 2007 event was the first PPV since Judgment Day 2003 (other than Wrestlemania, Summerslam, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series) to feature all three brands (Raw, SmackDown! and ECW) after WWE stopped with brand-only events.
Backlash often features rematches from WrestleMania, or matches based on events that took place at WrestleMania, hence the name.
