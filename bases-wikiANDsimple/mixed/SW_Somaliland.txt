Somaliland is a country in Africa. It is next to Djibouti and Ethiopia.
In May of 1991, five families in Somalia declared independence. They formed Somaliland out of six political areas in northern Somalia. Most countries do not think that Somaliland is an actual country, so it is "unrecognized".
Somaliland has a republican government, with free elections. The capital is Hargeisa.
