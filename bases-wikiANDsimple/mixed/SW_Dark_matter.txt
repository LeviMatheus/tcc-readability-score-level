We can use physics and mathematics to understand how strongly gravity affects something if we know enough about that thing, mainly how much mass it has. This way, we can understand how objects act on Earth. However, astrophysicists have learned that the way things in deep space behave is different.
Many scientists have tried to understand why the rules are different in deep space. One idea is that we do not really understand gravity as well as we think we do. Another idea, which many think is more likely, is that there is something called dark matter. If you do calculations on the things in deep space with "extra" mass, the then the rules work there too. So the idea is that there is more matter in the universe than we thought. This is called dark matter because we know nothing about it, and because so far we cannot find it.
Because dark matter does not seem to give off light, x-rays, or any other radiation, the instruments which can find normal matter are unable to find dark matter. It seems that dark matter is not made of the same thing as the matter we see everyday on Earth.
Recently, a group of scientists claimed they had found a way to observe dark matter. Since dark matter is supposedly very different from normal matter, it is expected to act differently. They observed two galaxies placed in such a position that normal matter would be stuck behind while dark matter would not, and by measuring gravity they were able to detect what they say is two clouds of two different kinds of matter. However, not everyone agrees that this proves that dark matter exists.
