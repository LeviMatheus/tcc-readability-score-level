The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international organization of thirty countries. Member countries of OECD accept a democratic system of governments. They also accept the principle of free economy. A country has a free economy, when its government does not control the economic activities of its citizens and companies. OECD had originated in 1948 as the Organization for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC). The Second World War had just ended three years before in 1945. Some countries of Europe came together to form OEEC to make easy re-building of industry and other things destroyed in the Second World War. Later on, some non-European countries also joined this organization. In 1960, OEEC changed its name, and it became OECD: the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.
The OECD's headquarters are at the Ch√¢teau de la Muette in Paris.
