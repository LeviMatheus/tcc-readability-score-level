Glam rock is a genre of rock music that was popular in the early 1970's. It was made famous by acts such as David Bowie, T. Rex, Alice Cooper, Slade, Gary Glitter, Queen, Sweet and Alvin Stardust. Glam fans (usually referred to as "glitter kids") and performers distinguished themselves from the denim-clad hippie-hordes with sci-fi/mythological/Hollywood glamour/ambisexual-inspired costumes, which were perceived as glamorous by the press. The music was characterised by languid, narcotic ballads and raunchy, high-energy Rolling Stones–influenced rock n‘ roll stylings.
