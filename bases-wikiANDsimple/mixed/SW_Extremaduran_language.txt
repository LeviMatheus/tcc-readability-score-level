The Extremaduran language ("estremeñu" in extremaduran) is the native language of Northwestern province of Cáceres. About 150,000 people speak it in Extremadura. This language is very similar to Leonese and Asturian Language, spoken in other territories that once made up the Kindgom of León. Is called "artu estremeñu" (High extremaduran) too. The Central and Low Extremaduran ("Meyu estremeñu" and "Bahu estremeñu") are spanish dialects with extremaduran influences.
