The Second Triumvirate was an alliance between Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marcus Antonius. It lasted from 43 BC to 33 BC. The creation of the Second Triumvirate effectively ended the effort by Marcus Tullius Cicero to reinstate the Senate as the sovereign body of the Republic.
