Canada's land is composed of thirteen parts: ten provinces and three territories. Canada is governed on the principles of a federation: the Provinces' governments share power with the Government of Canada (the federal government). The territories' governments have a more limited set of powers versus the federal government than that of the provinces'.
The provinces are located in the south of Canada, and the territories are in the north, where fewer people live.
Here is a list of the provinces, and their standard abbreviations, with their capitals (the cities where their governments have their offices).
