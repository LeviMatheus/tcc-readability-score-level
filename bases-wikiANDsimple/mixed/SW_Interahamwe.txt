The Interahamwe (pronounced Een-hair-ah-hahm-way, with the 't' pronounced as an 'h') was the main militia responsible for the 1994 Rwandan Genocide in which about one million abahutu against the genocide and abatutsi were massacred.
Methods.
The main weapon used by the Interahamwe was the machete ('mupanga'), though guns and primitive tools like clubs and hoes were also used.
Consequences.
About a half an hour after the assassination of President Juv√©nal Habyarimana on the night of April 6, 1994, Interahamwe roadblocks were all over Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. The genocide would end about 100 days later.
