A gland is a special organ. It can be found in animals (and of course humans). A gland makes a special substance. Very often this is a hormone. This substance is then put into the bloodstream. In this case, the gland is called endocrine gland. If the substance is released to somewhere else, the gland is called exocrine gland.
