Bastides are fortified towns. They were built mainly in the south of France, in the Middle Ages. Bastides were built mainly between 1229 and 1373. Today, there are about 400 bastides in total. They all have a central square, and a rectangular street layout. On the market square, the houses have arcades. They were usually built in places that were easy to defend. This means either on the top of a hill or on a plain which was easy to defend.
Well-known bastides today are Carcassonne and Andorra la Vella.
What made them possible?
The Treaty of Paris (1229) is sometimes seen as the foundation act which made the construction of modern cities and Bastides possible. The treaty itself ended the Albigensian Crusade. One of the first bastides built was Montauban. Montauban got city status in 1144, but some consider Mont-de-Marsan which was founded in 1133 to be a bastide.
What where they built for?
Most Bastides where built in the countryside, to basically serve the needs of local trade (and most often, agriculture). A few of them were built in positions which are easy to defend; others are where it is possible to defend them, but most Bastides where simply put where they fit best. The period when they were built was a peaceful one in the region.
Central square.
The central element of all bastides is a central place. It was used for markets, but also used for political and social functions. A typical square (likely a model for others) can be found in Montauban.
Generally, there is just one square. Exceptions are Saint-Lys and Albias. They have one square for the market, and one square for the church.
Generally the flattest location available was chosen for the square.
Church.
Except in very rare cases, the church was not on the central square. Usually it was at an angle, and gave to the square diagonally. One of the rare exceptions is Villefranche-de-Rouergue.
Houses.
There were clear rules how houses could be built in the bastide. The front of the houses - the facades - had to line up. Also there had to be a small space between the houses. The different housing lots were all alike. 8m by 24m was a common size. There were only a limited number of lots. This varied between 10, and several thousand (3.000 in Grenade-sur-Garonne)
Streets.
The streets were usually 6-10 m wide, so a chariot could pass through. They ran alongside the facades of the houses. Alleys run between streets, these are usually only 5-6m wide. Sometimes they are only 2-2.5m wide. In a bastide there were usually 1-8 streets.
City walls.
Since most bastides were founded in a peaceful period of history, most had no city walls or fortifications, at the start. Such things were added later. This was done either through a special tax, or through an act that required that the inhabitants of the city helped build the walls. A good example is Libourne. Ten years after the city was founded, its inhabitants asked for money to build city walls. Once they had received the money, however, they spent it on making their city prettier, rather than building walls.
At the beginning of the Hundred Years' War, many bastides that had no city walls were destroyed. Some of the others quickly built city walls of stone, to protect the city.
Layout of a bastide.
There are different base layouts for bastides. It seems that for each type of layout, there was one bastide that was an example on how to build such a layout. The most common layout seems to have been to start from two perpendicular streets. Other streets parallel to the already existing two were added. This led to a (usually rectangular grid layout.
Inorganic layout/embryonnary bastide.
An example of such a bastide is La Bastide-de-Bousignac
Circular bastide.
This layout was very rare. The only surviving exanple is in Fourcès.
Enclosing type.
They were built based on a village or hamlet which had not fully grown. Beforehand, there already was a church or a kernel of houses. When new houses and quarters are added, they are added around the initial kernel.
One-axis design.
These are quite common. It is estimated that 30-40% of all bastides had this design. Very often they can be found on flat land, in a plain. There is one principal street that links the two gates. The square very often is made by enlarging the main street. Very often there are alleys which run perpendicular to the main street. This layout is very easy to adapt to the geography.
An example of such a bastide is Gimont. Gimont is 1000m long, and only 300m wide. Sometimes, there is one street which runs parallel to the main axis. In that case, the city square is between the two streets.
Two-axis design.
This layout is considered as the type plan at the height of the movement. There are two axes, which are perpendicular (in a right angle). Streets are all at a right angle, parallel to one of the two base streets. The city square is very often in the center, or very near the center. The whole city is either rectangular or a square, or a hexagon or an oval.
Making a bastide.
Bastides wanted to attract people who should come to live there. They therefore offered equality to those who came to live there. They made it look like citizens had equal rights, and were free.
Legal foundations for bastides.
Social norms were very strict in the Middle Ages. The system of laws of the Middle Ages was built on the fact the norms were not changed. The lords who built the bastide did not want to change these norms. All they wanted was small local changes. Usually, the land where the bastide was built was underdeveloped. The lords that owned the land did not get much profit from it. They built the bastide because they hoped, that way they would get more profits from the land.
For these reasons, people who already had a social status, that is to say serfs, noblemen and priests could not settle in the bastide. A few poor noblemen did nevertheless, they gave their land to the city and started a career as a trader, because that way they could earn more than before.
Lepers were usually not welcome in the city. Certain bastides had special places which would treat them, but they were generally excluded from social life. They had to wear special badges to show they were ill, and they could not come close to normal people.
Another group of people that was generally not welcome were the jews. In the beginning there was no problem, but later jews were persecuted. Philip IV of France did not allow any jews to live in France, in 1306. He confiscated their belongings and sold them.
What became of bastides?
A certain number of bastides were successful and still exist today. Many others have failed, and most of their population left them.
