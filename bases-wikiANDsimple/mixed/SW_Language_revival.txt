Language revival is when people try to make a language that is not spoken, or is spoken very little, becomes spoken more often again. Language death is what happens when a language is not used by the people who spoke it before. Language revival wants to save a language that is dead or endangered. The Hebrew language was once a language that was not used, but because the language was revived, people now speak and use it again. Many languages today are now trying to be revived.
