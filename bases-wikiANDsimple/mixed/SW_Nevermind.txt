"Nevermind" is the second studio album by the American grunge band, Nirvana. While the album before this, "Bleach", was not very popular, "Nevermind" was. It had 4 singles: "Smells Like Teen Spirit," "Come as You Are," "In Bloom," and "Lithium." There was some controversy because of a child's penis which was visible on the front cover.
