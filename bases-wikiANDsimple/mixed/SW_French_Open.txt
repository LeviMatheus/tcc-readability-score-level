The French Open is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is played in Paris, France. The first competition was held in 1891.
The French Open is famous for being the only Grand Slam played on a clay court. On a clay court the ball bounces much slower and higher than on hard or grass courts. This makes it more difficult to win the point and rallies (the number of shots in a point) usually last longer. Players that excel on clay courts are called "Clay-court specialists".
The tournament is played in the summer, for two weeks in length. It starts near the end of May and finshes during the first few days of June.
Sometimes, the French Open is called the Roland Garros tournament. Roland Garros was a well-known aviator from World War I who had the main tennis court named after him.
The winners in 2007 were Rafael Nadal and Justine Henin.
