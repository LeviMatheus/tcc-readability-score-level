"When It's All Over We Still Have to Clear Up" is the second full-length album by the Alternative rock band Snow Patrol. It was released on March 5, 2001. Gary Lightbody wrote all of the lyrics, and wrote the music with Mark McClelland and Jonny Quinn.
When the album first was released, it was not bought enough to get its name onto the top 200 albums chart. After the next album, "Final Straw", became popular, people began buying "When It's All Over We Still Have To Clear Up", and it went onto the chart.
