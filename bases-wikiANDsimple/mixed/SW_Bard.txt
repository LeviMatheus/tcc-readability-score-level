Bards were probably a social class in Celtic Europe. They were poets or singers. Most likely they were in the service of Celtic nobility. They were probably employed to tell about how good their master (the nobleman) was, or to sing about what he did. Today, it is not quite clear what the difference was to a druid. Early Roman scolars used the word vates to refer to all of them. "Vates" has been translated as "prophet" or "soothsayer".
