Nord-Ouest (English: "North-West") is one of the ten departments (French: "départments", singular "départment") of Haiti. It is located in the northwestern part of the country.
It has an area of 2,176 km² and a population of 488,500 (2002). Its capital is Port-de-Paix. The Tortuga Island is part of this department. It is a very dry region, except for the Tortuga Island and the area around Port-de-Paix.
The department is bordered to the north by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by the Nord Department and to the south by the Artibonite Department and the Gulf of Gonâve. To the east is the Windward Passage that separates the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba. On clear nights, it is possible to see the Guantánamo Province of Cuba.
After the Haitian Revolution, the country was divided into only three departments: Nord, Ouest and Sud. The Nord-West department was part of the Nord department.
