"Annie Hall" is a 1977 movie from United Artists. Woody Allen was the director, and one of the cast members.
At first it was called "Anhedonia", but this title would not sell the movie. Nor was another one, "It Had to Be Jew".
"Annie Hall" has been considered a biography of Allen's real life, but the actor has denied this claim.
Plot.
The movie takes place in New York City and Los Angeles, California.
It tells the story of Alvy Singer, a comedian from Brooklyn who loves death. He has an affair with the title character (played by Diane Keaton), who loves life.
Alvy says his Brooklyn house was below a roller coaster on Coney Island. His father was the owner of a place that had bumper cars.
Techniques.
"Annie Hall" is noted for its use of special elements such as double exposure (two pictures in one) and magic themes in a real setting.
There is an animated scene with a cartoon version of Allen, and the Witch from Disney's "Snow White".
Academy Awards.
Allen was nominated for Best Actor.
Recognition.
It has been called one of the best comedy movies of all time. It has appeared on IMDb's Top 250 List, and was number thirty on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list.
Influence.
Many of today's romantic comedy movies have been influenced by "Annie Hall". The tie that was worn by Keaton's character was popular at the time of the movie's release.
Christopher Walken, who would later become more famous, had his first major role as the title character's brother.
