A virtuoso is someone who plays a musical instrument brilliantly. Musicians who have exceptional talent and can play extremely fast and difficult music are "virtuosi" (plural of "virtuoso"). In the 19th century Niccolò Paganini was a virtuoso violinist as well as a composer. Franz Liszt was a virtuoso pianist and composer.
Musicians may sometimes talk about “virtuoso music” meaning music which is so difficult that only a virtuoso could play it.
