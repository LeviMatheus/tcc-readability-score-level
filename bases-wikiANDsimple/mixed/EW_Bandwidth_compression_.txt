In telecommunication, the term bandwidth compression has the following meanings: 
Bandwidth compression implies a reduction in normal bandwidth of an information-carrying signal without reducing the information content of the signal. This can be accomplished with lossless data compression techniques. For more information read the Increasing speeds section in the Modem article. Bandwidth Compression is a core feature of WAN Optimization appliances to improve bandwidth efficiency.
