A secondary source is a document or recording that writes or speaks about information that was originally presented elsewhere. This information is called "primary source" or "original source" of the information.
Secondary sources often involve generalization, analysis, synthesis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information.
In historiography, a secondary source is a study written by a scholar about a topic, and using primary sources and other secondary sources.
Example.
An example of a secondary source is the biography of a historical figure in which the author tells the story on the basis of many primary source documents, such as letters, diaries, newspaper accounts, photographs, and official records. A scholarly secondary source is familiar with the existing secondary literature and seeks to engage it in terms of arguments and evidence. Most, but not all, secondary sources use extensive citation.
Secondary sources in law.
Secondary sources are often used in common law, to allow judges to determine what is actually meant by the language of a particular statute. See legislative intent.
