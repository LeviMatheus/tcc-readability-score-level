Habitat.
Although not native to North America the house mouse, since its early accidental introduction at most of our seaport towns, has become widespread throughout the United States and occurs either as a commensal or feral animal in practically all parts of the United States. As commensal animals, house mice live in close association with man â€” in his houses, outbuildings, stores, and other structures. Where conditions permit, feral mice may be found in fields, along watercourses, and in other places where vegetation is dense enough to afford concealment. They tend to hide in the winter as the climate is too cold to naturally survive in. They will usually stay in cool dark places like garden sheds. They will only stay up until the summer where they will find a new place to live.
