History.
Zambia originated from Northern Rhodesia which was a colony of Great Britain. It got its independence in 1965. The first president was Kenneth Kaunda, who ruled Zambia for 30 years with his party UNIP. Zambia was a one party democracy. UNIP was the only legal party and all other partys were banned.
After protests, democratic elections were held in 1991. Kenneth Kaunda lost the elections and gave away his power in a orderly manner to his successor Frederick Chiluba, a former union leader.
Zambia is now a multi-party democracy. It has had three democratic elections since 1991. The latest presidential election was in 2006, which was won by Levy Mwanawasa.
Economy.
In the 1960's, Zambia was a well to do state because of the copper deposits that were mined in Copperbelt province. When the price of copper lowered in the 1970's, the economy dwindled. It is said that Zambia was born with a copper spoon in its mouth.
Today, Zambia is a poor country. It does not have many industries. Copper is still its main export. Commercial farming is a growing industry as well.
