Adam and Eve is a story from the Torah. It also occurs in the Old Testament of the Bible, and the Qu'ran. According to the story, "Adam and Eve" were the first two people. They lived in the Garden of Eden, but were made to leave because they ate the Forbidden fruit, which God told them not to eat.
God punished Eve because she had been tricked by the serpent. God said that woman shall always bear children in intense pain, and that "man shall be your master".
God also punished Adam for eating the fruit and said that man will always struggle to extract a living from the soil, and would return at death to the soil from where he came from.
