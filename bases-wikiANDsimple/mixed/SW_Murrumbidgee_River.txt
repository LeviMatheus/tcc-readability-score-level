The Murrumbidgee River is a big river in New South Wales, Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. It joins in with the Murray River. The word "Murrumbidgee" is from the Wiradjuri language (Indigenous Australian) and means "big water", "track goes down here" or "very good place". There are many large towns built next to the river, Gundagai, Wagga Wagga, Narrandera, Hay and Balranald.
