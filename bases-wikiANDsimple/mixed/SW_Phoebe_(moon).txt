Phoebe is a moon which goes around (orbits) the planet called Saturn. It takes eighteen months for Phoebe to go all the way around Saturn. It is half made out of rock, and half made out of ice. The ground on Phoebe is black, which means that it is very dark when seen from Earth. Phoebe does not have any air, and there is no water on its surface. Because there is no air or water, there are no people living there.
There are many craters on Phoebe. These are from asteroids and other things crashing into it, and leaving round marks on the surface.
Phoebe is slightly irregular, which means that it is not spherical, or circular. It has an average diameter of 220 km. This means that Phoebe is about 1/15th the size of Earth's moon.
