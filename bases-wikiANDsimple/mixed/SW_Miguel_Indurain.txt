Miguel √Ångel Indurain Larraya (born July 16, 1964,) was a Spanish road racing cyclist. He was a professional from 1985 to 1996. He was the first person to win the Tour de France five times in a row from 1991 to 1996. He also won the Giro d'Italia two times, in 1992 and 1993. In 1994 he cycled 53.040 kilometres in one hour, which was a new hour record. He also won the Olympic Gold medal for the time trial in 1996.
Indurain was very good at time trials. In the five Tours de France that he won, he only won two stages that were not time trials. He finished time trials much quicker than other cyclists, so he did not have to work too hard in mountain stages. In the 1996 Tour de France he had a bad cold and he could not win. He retired later in 1997.
