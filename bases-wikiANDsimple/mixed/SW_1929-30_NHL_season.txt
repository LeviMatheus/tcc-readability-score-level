Stanley Cup playoffs.
After defeating the Montreal Maroons and after losing more than one game in a row games all season, the Boston Bruins were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens two games to none in a best-of-three series. The Canadiens then won the Cup with a 4–3 victory in game two. The Canadiens went 5–0–1 in the playoffs, making them one of the few Cup winning teams in history to not lose a game in the playoffs.
