Peter Wessel Zapffe (December 18, 1899 – October 12, 1990) was a Norwegian metaphysician, author, lawyer and mountaineer. He is often noted for his philosophically pessimistic and fatalistic view of human existence—his system of philosophy was inspired by the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer—as well as his firm advocacy of antinatalism. His thoughts regarding the error of human life are presented in the essay "The Last Messiah" (). This essay is a shorter version of his best-known and yet to be translated work, the philosophical treatise "On the Tragic" ("Om det tragiske", 1941).
Philosophical work.
Zapffe's view is that humans are born with an overdeveloped skill (understanding, self-knowledge) which does not fit into nature's design. The human craving for justification on matters such as life and death cannot be satisfied, hence humanity has a need that nature cannot satisfy. The tragedy, following this theory, is that humans spend all their time trying not to be human. The human being, therefore, is a paradox.
In "The Last Messiah", Zapffe described four principal defense mechanisms that humankind uses to avoid facing this paradox:
Other interests and works.
Zapffe was a prolific mountaineer and took a very early interest in environmentalism; this form of nature conservationism sprung from the intent, not of protecting nature, but to avoid human culturalization of nature.
Zapffe was the author of many humorous short stories about climbing and other adventures in nature.
Personal life.
Zapffe married Bergljot Espolin Johnsen in 1935; they divorced in 1941. He married Berit Riis Christensen in 1952, they remained together until his death in 1990; Berit died in May 2008. Zapffe remained childless by choice. He was lifelong friends with the Norwegian philosopher and fellow mountaineer, Arne Næss.
