Coppins is an English country house in the village of Iver in Buckinghamshire. It was changed for Princess Victoria, a daughter of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra. After her father's death, Princess Victoria stayed with Queen Alexandra at Sandringham House as her mother's companion. After Queen Alexandra's death in 1925, Princess Victoria moved into Coppins, which had a "relaxed air of a holiday villa". Victoria lived for another ten years, dying at Coppins on 2 December 1935, aged 67. She left the house to her nephew, Prince George, the Duke of Kent, and his wife Princess Marina. It was owned by the Kent family for two generations, and was sold in 1973 to Commander Eli Gottlieb.
