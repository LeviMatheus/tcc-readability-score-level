An alpha male is the top-ranking animal in a social group.
Origin.
Some animals live in a social structure where the more powerful male in the group is decided by either simple play-fights or even very aggressive battles.
The current alpha male must defend his ranking from younger members.
When he is too old or not strong enough to win, he loses his position in the group.
The result of this is that the alpha male usually has more opportunity to mate with the available females.
This system evolved because strong males will produce young which have a better chance for survival.
Human examples.
Alpha male can also refer to an aggressive, highly-ranked man in a human group â€“ usually in a business setting. This is usually a very informal use, and sometimes seen as an insult to that person.
Trivia.
A new term which is entering our lexicon is the Alpha Dad. Men that enter young adulthood that can be considered Alpha Males often mature to become Alpha Dads; the Alpha Male with children, or simply a more mature example of the same. The Alpha Dad retains many of the same traits as the Alpha Male - the apex of a social or peer-oriented heirarchy - but the objectives and social "dominance" perspectives diminish, with emphasis placed on the performance and integrity of the individual, rather than social position.
