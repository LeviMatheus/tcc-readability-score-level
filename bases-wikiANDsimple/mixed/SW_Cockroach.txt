The cockroach is a type of insect that has many species and is often considered a pest to humans. About 30 species invade human homes, less than 1% of total cockroach species. Cockroaches have existed a very long time. The earliest cockroach fossils are 354â€“295 million years old. Most cockroaches are omnivores.
Cockroaches grow to maturity in 3-4 months and can live up to 1 year. A female German cockroach can produce 8 egg cases in her lifetime and each egg case may contain 30-40 eggs.
