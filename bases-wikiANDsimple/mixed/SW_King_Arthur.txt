King Arthur is a legendary king in the mythology of Great Britain. He lived in Camelot and owned the mythical sword Excalibur.
Some think King Arthur lived some time from the end of 5th century to the early 6th century. He might have been a king or a leader of Britons. Later his story grew with additional stories like the magician Merlin or the knight Sir Lancelot. No one knows whether he is a real person or not. Some say he is a mythical person like Hercules and some say he is a real person with a miraculous story.
When he was young.
His dad was Uther Pendragon, but when Arthur was born his mother, Lady Igraine, died. Later on his dad died too, so Arthur was sent to live with a knight when he was still a baby. When he grew up, he found a sword stuck in a stone. He was told that whoever could pull it out was the true king. So he pulled it out and became king. After that sword broke, Arthur got another sword named Excalibur.
Lancelot and Guinevere.
When he was older, he married Lady Guinevere. They lived very happily together until one of King Arthur's best knights, Sir Lancelot, had an affair with Lady Guinevere. King Arthur was furious, but in the end forgave both of them. Lancelot apologized for his behaviour and decided to leave the kingdom, as he thought himself not worthy of King Arthur's favour. Guinevere, although she was allowed to stay (as with Lancelot), decided to leave as well to another part of the kingdom.
How King Arthur died.
Later on, King Arthur's sword Excalibur was stolen and used by a traitor named Mordred. They fought and Mordred was able to make King Arthur bleed, but King Arthur killed Mordred in the end. Finally, King Arthur died from losing too much blood, and one of his knights threw the mystical sword Excalibur into the lake where it came from.
