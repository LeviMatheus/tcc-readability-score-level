"This Is Me" is a single by Demi Lovato on "The Camp Rock Soundtrack". The song was released the same day the soundtrack appeared in stores. The song was also remixed on the pre-release CD of "Camp Rock" and the "Camp Rock Soundtrack" pre-release version.
Song Information.
This is the first song that Demi Lovato's character, Mitchie Torres, sang in "Camp Rock" with Joe Jonas's character, Shane Gray. Mitchie wrote the song in the beginning of the movie. She was later heard (in an acoustic version on piano), but not seen, by Shane. He started to search for the girl behind the amazing voice. After most people performed already in the "Final Jam" session, Mitchie sang the song (original version), and Shane saw her and sang part of the song he wrote, "Gotta Find You". The two songs are combined to make the original version, as featured on the Camp Rock soundtrack CD.
