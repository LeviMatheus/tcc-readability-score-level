"Shrek" is an animated movie based upon William Steig's 1990 fairy tale picture book called "Shrek!". It was directed by Andrew Adamson and animated by DreamWorks Animation SKG in May 2001. It was the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, a category introduced in 2001. It was released on DVD on November 2, 2001. There have also been two sequels (follow-ups) of Shrek, called Shrek 2 and Shrek the Third.
The name "Shrek" likely comes from the Yiddish word "שרעק" (pronounced Shreck) or the German word "Schreck". Both words mean "fear" or "terror".
