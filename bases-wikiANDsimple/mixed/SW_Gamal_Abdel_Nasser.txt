Gamal Abdel Nasser was the leader of the Egyptian revolution in 1952 The revolution turned Egypt into a republic instead of a kingdom, and it was the reason why the British army got out of Egypt. Nasser was born in 1918 in Upper Egypt, then he became the president of Egypt in 1954. He worked to build the high dam, and made the Suez Canal to be returned to Egypt. Nasser also fought The Six Day War with Israel but Israel won. He died in 1970.
Gamal Abdel Nasser was most beloved by the Egyptian people. He was their saviour from the British occupation & the corrupted royality. He started his era with a series of corrections & rectifications in most of Egypt's systems. Then he started the "Nationalization" or "التأميم" of Egyptian resources. That means that he made the government take possition of most of income sources in the country previously held by individuals & re-distributing them on the commons. This was very "communist" deed.
1) The freedom of education (students get educated in government's schools free of charge with no feez)
2) the construction of the "High Dam" at Aswan, the south of Egypt to produce electricity from the water flow & preserve fresh water for the people to purify & drink & for the irregation of the crops.
