Widescreen is a video format often used in movies. It is also becoming very popular for television and other things like Computer monitors.
Widescreen is often used as it let more of an image to be seen on the screen.
Widescreen is often used as a nickname for the 16:9 aspect ratio of television screens. This means that if the television screen was sixteen inches wide it would have to be nine inches tall. A "regular" television's screen would be 4:3 which means if it was four inches wide it would have to be three inches tall. In adition to these small screens, a screen could be any size with the same ratio. For example, a screen could be 32 inches wide and 18 inches tall and still be considered widescreen.
