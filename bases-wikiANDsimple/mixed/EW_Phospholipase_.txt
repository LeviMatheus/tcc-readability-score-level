A phospholipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids into fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. Acids trigger the release of bound calcium from cellular stores and the consequent increase in free cytosolic Ca2+, an essential step in calcium signaling to regulate intracellular processes. There are four major classes, termed A, B, C and D, which are distinguished by the type of reaction which they catalyze:
Types C and D are considered phosphodiesterases.
Endothelial lipase is primarily a phospholipase.
Phospholipase A2 acts on the intact lecithin molecule and hydrolyses the fatty acid esterified to the second carbon atom. The resulting products are lysolecithin and a fatty acid. Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme present in the venom of bees and viper snakes.
