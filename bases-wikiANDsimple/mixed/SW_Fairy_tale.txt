A fairy tale is a fictional (made-up) story which has characters, animals and creatures from folklore; for example fairies, goblins, trolls, giants, or elves. They often include princesses or princes and most fairy tales have a happy ending.
Examples of traditional old fairy tales are "Sleeping Beauty" and "Little Red Riding Hood". There can also be new fairy tales written by an author, like "The Little Mermaid" or "Pinocchio". New fairy tales were for example written by Hans Christian Andersen, James Thurber and Oscar Wilde.
