"Revolver" is a monthly hard rock and heavy metal magazine published by Future US. It started as a magazine that was about more popular styles of music, but then changed to what it is now. The magazine is put together a lot like "Spin", and also writes about the heavy metal and punk subcultures. It has cover stories (usually centering on a band's new album, song, or upcoming tour), album reviews, instrument reviews, and a section for readers to get advice from a celebrity.
Another notable feature of the magazine is its coverage of underground and up-and-coming bands from all over the world. Instead of focusing only on the most popular bands, "Revolver" introduces a lot that are not played on the radio or on MTV.
Its slogan is: "The World's Loudest Rock Magazine!"
