Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus (December 15, 37 â€“ June 9, 68), born Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, also called Nero for short, was the fifth and last Roman Emperor of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Nero was adopted by his grand-uncle Claudius. Claudius wanted Nero to become emperor after Claudius' death. Nero became emperor on October 13, 54, after Claudius died.
Nero is known as the emperor who played a fiddle while Rome burned, yet he really was singing. He also treated Christians very badly. However, some ancient sources show that Nero was very popular with the common people during and after his reign.
In 68, Nero went into hiding. It is thought that he committed suicide to escape execution by the Roman Senate.
