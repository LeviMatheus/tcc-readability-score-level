This is the complete list of women's Olympic medalists in athletics.
Discontinued events.
3000 metres.
The 3000 metres run was replaced by the 5000 metres run in 1996 and henceforth.
80 metres hurdles.
The 80 metres hurdles was replaced by the 100 metres hurdles in 1972.
Pentathlon.
In 1984 and thenceforth, the pentathlon (five events over two days) was replaced by the heptathlon (seven events over two days), so "discontinued" is not precisely correct. The heptathlon consists of the 200 meter and 800 meter runs, the 100 meter hurdles, the shot put, the javelin throw, the high jump, and the long jump in track and field: three "track" events and four "field" events.
10 kilometers race walk.
In the year 2000 and henceforth, the distance was doubled to 20 kilometers.
