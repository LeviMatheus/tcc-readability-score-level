Bowling is a sport where people roll a ball down a bowling lane to try to knock ten bowling pins down without going into the gutters or missing. There are other kinds of bowling as well.
Description.
The bowling ball has three holes in it that the person puts his or her ring, middle, and thumb. The person has to go up to the lane, lift the ball back, and roll the ball down a 60 foot long lane attempting to knock down ten wooden pins. If the person doesn't do it right, the ball might not knock all the pins down or might roll into the gutter. If all the pins get knocked down, the person who throws the ball gets a strike. If the person does not get all the pins down, he or she gets another chance to knock them down. If they get knocked down in the second try, the person gets a spare. There are ten turns (or frames) in bowling, and the goal is to get as many strikes as possible. A perfect game adds up to a max of 300 points, which is very hard to get as the person needs to knock down every single pin.
