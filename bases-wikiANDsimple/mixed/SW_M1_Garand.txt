The M1 Garand is a rifle that was mostly used by the US Army during World War 2. It had an eight bullet stripper clip. After the stripper clip had run of bullets a bell would sound letting you know that you should reload. This bell could prove annoying and sometimes dangerous when trying to maintain silence. It was and still is the only rifle to have an eight bullet stripper clip. The rifle was designed and made by a Canadian engineer. It will always hold it's title as one of world's greatest rifles.
