Nomadic people (or nomads) are people who move from place to place, rather than living in one place. The best known examples of nomads are gypsies, Roma, Sinti and Irish travellers. Many other ethnic groups and communities are traditionally nomadic; such as Berbers, Kazakhs, Samis and Bedouin.
Many nomads live on herding livestock, such as cattle, horses or reindeer. This has required a moving lifestyle in the past, so it has been more convenient to move from place to place rather than to settle in one place.
