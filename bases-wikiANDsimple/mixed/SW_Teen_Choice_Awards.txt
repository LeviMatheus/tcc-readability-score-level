The Teen Choice Awards is an awards show presented annually by FOX. The program honors the year's biggest achievements in music, movies, sports, and television, as voted on by teens aged 12-19. The program usually features a high number of celebrities and musical performers. The winners are awarded with lifesize surfboards, fit to the summertime theme. The ceremony has also created spin-off teen awards on YouTube.
Starting in 1999, the "Teen Choice Awards" were presented weeks prior to the televised event up through 2005. Since 2006, the program has been televised live.
