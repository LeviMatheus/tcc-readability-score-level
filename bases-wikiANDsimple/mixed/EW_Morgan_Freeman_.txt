Early life.
Morgan Freeman was born on June 1, 1937 in Memphis, Tennessee. He is the son of Mamie Edna (née Revere; 1912–2000), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman (July 6, 1915 – April 27, 1961), a barber, who died of cirrhosis in 1961. He has three older siblings. According to DNA analysis, some of his ancestors were from the Songhai and Tuareg people of Niger. Some of Freeman's great-great-grandparents were slaves who migrated from North Carolina to Mississippi. Freeman later discovered that his Caucasian maternal great-great-grandfather had lived with, and was buried beside, Freeman's African-American great-great-grandmother in the segregated South, as the two could not legally marry at the time. The DNA test suggested that among all of his African ancestors, a little over one-quarter came from the area that stretches from present-day Senegal to Liberia and three-quarters came from the Congo-Angola region.
As an infant, Freeman was sent to his paternal grandmother in Charleston, Mississippi. He moved frequently during his childhood, living in Greenwood, Mississippi; Gary, Indiana; and finally Chicago, Illinois. When Freeman was 16 years old, he contracted pneumonia. He made his acting debut at age nine, playing the lead role in a school play. He then attended Broad Street High School, a building which serves today as Threadgill Elementary School, in Greenwood, Mississippi. At age 12, he won a statewide drama competition, and while settling into school, discovered music and theatre.

Next, Freeman starred in the comedy-drama "Driving Miss Daisy," alongside Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd. Based on Alfred Uhry's play, in which Freeman appeared previously, he reprises his role of Hoke Colburn, a chauffeur for a Jewish widow. The film was a commercial success and grossed US$145 million worldwide. Film critics were mainly positive; Henry Sheehan from "The Hollywood Reporter" opined that Freeman and Tandy's performances complemented each other while retaining their "individual star-quality". The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Actor for Freeman.
His third release was the biographical drama "Lean on Me", in which Freeman portrays the principal of an under-performing and drug- and crime-ridden New Jersey high school. Jane Galbraith of "Variety" magazine thought Freeman's casting was "wonderful". Lastly in 1989, he starred in Walter Hill's "Johnny Handsome", a crime drama in which he plays a New Orleans police officer. In a 1990 interview, Freeman said "Glory" was one of his favorite releases—"The Black legacy is as noble, is as heroic, is as filled with adventure and conquest and discovery as anybody else's. It's just that nobody knows it."
In 1990, Freeman provided the voice of Frederick Douglass in "The Civil War," a television miniseries about the American Civil War. That year, he also starred in the critically panned "The Bonfire of the Vanities." According to the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 16% based on 51 reviews. In the summer of 1990, he played Petruchio, a role he had been thinking about for six years, in Shakespeare's "The Taming of the Shrew," which opened at Delacorte theatre in New York City.

In 1993, Freeman made his directorial debut with the drama "Bopha!", which tells the story of a black policeman (Danny Glover) during South Africa's apartheid era. "Bopha!" was well-received, in particular for Freeman's directing. Hal Hinson of "The Washington Post" wrote, "Freeman lays out the father-son dynamics with great skill and very little fuss. There's no hysteria in his approach; instead, he sticks to the facts, relying on his cast to provide the emotion. The result is a surprisingly powerful, insightful film." Kenneth Turan from "Los Angeles Times" also complimented Freeman's direction but thought the film was "more predictable than powerful".
In 1994, Freeman portrayed Red, the redeemed convict in Frank Darabont's acclaimed drama "The Shawshank Redemption" with co-star Tim Robbins. It is based on the 1982 Stephen King novella "Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption". Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, despite the novella's character of a white Irishman. Filming proved to be challenging, mainly because of Darabont's need for multiple takes. "The answer [I’d give him] was no [...] having to do something again and again for no discernible reason tends to be a bit debilitating to the energy", Freeman said. Nevertheless, Freeman's performance was described as "quietly impressive" and "moving" by "The New York Times". At the 67th Academy Awards, Freeman received a nomination for Best Actor. Since its release, "The Shawshank Redemption" has remained popular among audiences. In 1994, Freeman also served as a member of the jury at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1995, Freeman also starred with Brad Pitt in David Fincher's crime thriller "Seven," the story of two detectives who attempt to identify a serial killer who bases his murders on the Christian seven deadly sins. Freeman's performance generated a positive response; Owen Gleiberman of "Entertainment Weekly" wrote "Freeman plays nearly every scene in a doleful hush; he makes you lean in to hear his words, to ferret out the hints of anger and regret that haunt this weary knight." The critic from "Variety" magazine called Freeman's acting "supremely nuanced".
A year later, Freeman appeared in "Chain Reaction" as Paul Shannon, a science fiction thriller co-starring Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz. The film was a critical and commercial disappointment. Next, he was cast opposite Robin Wright in 1996's "Moll Flanders," a period drama based on the novel of the same name.

In reaction to the death of Freddie Gray and the 2015 Baltimore protests, Freeman said he was "absolutely" supportive of the protesters. "That unrest [in Baltimore] has nothing to do with terrorism at all, except the terrorism we suffer from the police. [...] Because of the technology—everybody has a smartphone—now we can see what the police are doing. We can show the world, 'Look, this is what happened in that situation.' So why are so many people dying in police custody? And why are they all Black? And why are all the police killing them white? What is that? The police have always said, 'I feared for my safety.' Well, now we know. OK. You feared for your safety while a guy was running away from you, right?"
During the 2008 presidential election, Freeman endorsed Barack Obama's presidential bid, although he said he would not join Obama's campaign.

Freeman later said that his experience working on "The Story of God with Morgan Freeman" did not change his views on religion.
On the evening of August 3, 2008, Freeman was injured in an automobile crash when his 1997 Nissan Maxima suffered a rollover near Ruleville, Mississippi.

Doctors operated on him for four hours to repair nerve damage in his shoulder and arm. His publicist announced he was expected to make a full recovery.

In response, Freeman issued an apology; "Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy. I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected—that was never my intent." The spokesperson for Lori McCreary, Freeman's business partner, did not respond to CNN's request for comment. Several journalists spoke out in response to the story, including Tyra Martin who stated, "I’m not, never was [a victim]. CNN totally misrepresented the video and took my remarks out of context.” Freeman's lawyer demanded that CNN retract the story. The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) did not take any action against Freeman. On December 8, 2020, "La Opinión" reported on a Spanish-language blog post from 2018 that alleged that CNN fabricated their report on Freeman.
Artistry and legacy.
Freeman's deep voice is considered to be distinctive, iconic, and recognizable, which frequently makes him a preferable choice for narration in films and documentaries. The journalist Radhika Sanghani writes that his "deeply reassuring voice, with its mellifluous tones and authoritative presence, is why an entire generation still hear his trademark tones when they think of the almighty." Freeman said that his voice developed in this way while taking speech classes in college; he found that most people speak in a voice either too fast or too high and he developed a commanding voice by speaking in a lower octave and enunciating each word.
According to author Miriam DeCosta-Willis, Freeman is an intuitive actor. He likes to select his roles carefully, and study the character to ensure he portrays them with depth, sensitivity, and substance. Commenting on Freeman's persona, Beverly Todd, who co-starred with him in "Lean on Me" (1989) and "The Bucket List" (2007) said, "The world knows he is such a consummate actor. He's a very sharing actor and such a nice guy. He's not the kind of actor who demands that he has all of the scenes and all the dialogues and all the emphasis is on him". Freeman has said he is interested in playing character roles, and values the importance of listening carefully while filming scenes, saying "The big danger in acting is to wait for your line. That's what I never do. I always listen, no matter how many times we do it."
On October 28, 2006, Freeman was honored at the first Mississippi's Best Awards in Jackson, Mississippi with the Lifetime Achievement Award for his work in film and theatre. He received an honorary Doctor of Arts and Letters degree from Delta State University during the school's commencement exercises on May 13, 2006.
