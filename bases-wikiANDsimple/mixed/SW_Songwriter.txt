A songwriter is a writer who creates songs. A songwriter generally writes pop songs, rather than art songs or classical music. Many songwriters are also singers, and perform the songs they write. Other songwriters have their songs performed by other singers.
History.
The history of writing songs is thousands of years old. Scholars believe that men and women may have created and sung songs even at the time of prehistory. Many modern bands have one or two members who write songs for the band. Others have more members contribute songs, or give the whole band credit for writing. Others perform songs by outside writers.
