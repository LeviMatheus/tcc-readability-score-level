The Mean is a measure from mathematics or from statistics. If people do many different measurements, they will get many different results. Those results have a certain distribution, and they can also be centered around an "average" value. This average value is what mathematicians call arithmetic mean.
Mean can also stand for expected value.
Problems with the arithmetic mean.
The problem with using the mean is that the information about how the values are distributed is lost.
Solving the problem.
This is different to the Median. The median is the number that divides all the samples in such a way that half of the samples are below it, and the other half above.
The modus or Mode is the number with the greatest number of samples, or observations.
