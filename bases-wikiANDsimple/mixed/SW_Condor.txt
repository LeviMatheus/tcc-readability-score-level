Condors are a species of bird. They are the largest flying birds that still exist. There are two species of condor, one that lives in the Andes, and another one, that lives in California. Condors are scavengers. They feed on carrion. Carrion is meat, that other animals leave behind. It can also be animals that died.
"Condors" belong to the family of New World Vultures. There is also a family Old World Vultures, which contains eagles, kites, and hawks amongst others. The "Condors" are more closely related to the storks though.
The Andean condor, has a wingspan of between 274 and 310 cm, and wheights around 11-15 kg.
