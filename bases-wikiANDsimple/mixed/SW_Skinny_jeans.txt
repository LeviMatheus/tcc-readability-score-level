Skinny Jeans are a style of denim jeans that have straight legs and tend to crumple around the ankles. They are called "skinny jeans" because they give you a thin figure. This style was started in the 1980's to make a retro-punk look. This style came to life again in late 2006 by Avril Lavigne in one of her music videos. They are usually used for a gothic-punk look or retro.
