In genealogy, a cousin is a relative, other than an ancestor or descendant, who shares a common ancestor. The word cousin is often used to refer to a person's first cousin - the child of one's aunt or uncle. The word only sometimes means siblings, siblings of ancestors, or descendants of siblings, because other words are more common (for example a brother, sister, aunt, uncle, nephew, niece, and so on).
How the cousin system works.
A second cousin once removed is your second cousin but one generation up (for example their parent).
Each time it is removed once, that person will go one generation up.
