Sola fide means "Faith only". Protestants believed that people must trust Jesus. They have to trust that Jesus lets people into heaven. Only people who trust Jesus can get to heaven.
This believe was a principle of the Protestant Reformation of the reformer Martin Luther and is a principle of Protestants today (see Five solas).
