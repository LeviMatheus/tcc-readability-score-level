In mathematics, a quotient is the end result of a division problem. For example, in the problem 6 รท 3, the quotient would be 2. Then 6 would be called the dividend, and 3 the divisor. The quotient can also be expressed as the number of times the divisor divides into the dividend.
A quotient can also mean just the integral part of the result of dividing two integers. For example, the quotient of 13 รท 5 would be 2 while the remainder would be 3.
Quotients also come up in certain tests, like the IQ test, which stands for intelligence quotient. In this case, your quotient is basically your score. In recent decades, as people begin to emphasize on full personal development, other similar quotients appeared.
