French Polynesia (French: "Polynésie française", Tahitian: "Porinetia Farani") is a French "overseas collectivity" (French: "collectivité d'outre mer", or COM) with the particular designation of "overseas country" (French: "pays d'outre-mer", or "POM") in the southern Pacific Ocean.
The country is made up of several groups of Polynesian islands. The most well-known is Tahiti, the most populous island, which is located in the Society Islands group. It is also where the capital of the territory, Papeete, can be found.
Although it does not really belong in the territory, French Polynesia is in charge of affairs for Clipperton Island.
Aside from Tahiti, some other important atolls, islands, and island groups in French Polynesia are: Ahe, Bora Bora, Hiva `Oa, Huahine, Maiao, Maupiti, Mehetia, Moorea, Nuku Hiva, Raiatea, Tahaa, Tetiaroa, Tubuai, and Tupai.
