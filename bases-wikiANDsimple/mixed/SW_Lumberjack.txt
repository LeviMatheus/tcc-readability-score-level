A lumberjack is a person who cuts down trees to be made into lumber. Lumberjacks used to cut with axes, but now lumberjacks use chainsaws. Many lumberjacks in North America still wear plaid shirts and jeans. Lumberjacks are usually divided into four types- The fellers, the buckers,the skidders and the transporters.
