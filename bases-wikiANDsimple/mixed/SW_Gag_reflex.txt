Gag reflex is a normal reflex in human, that prevents the passage of anything from throat, except during normal swallowing. It is also named as "pharyngeal reflex".
Touching the soft palate results in a very strong gag reflex in most healthy people. The gag reflex can also be used to make someone vomit.
