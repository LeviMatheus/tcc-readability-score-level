Following its introduction into the WWF Luke Graham and Tarzan Tyler became the first "WWWF Tag Team Champions" on June 3. In 1979 the title became known as the "World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Tag Team Championship" when the promotion renamed itself World Wrestling Federation
In 2001 at the Survivor Series Pay-per-view during the Invasion Storyline The Hardy Boyz, Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy who were the current "World Tag Team Champions" and were competing for the "World Wrestling Federation" took on The Dudley Boys, Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley who were the current WCW World Tag Team Champions and were competing for "The Alliance" in a title unification match inside a Steel Cage, The Dudley Boys defeated The Hardy Boyz and were named the last WCW Tag Team Champions while also becoming the "WWF Tag Team Champions"
After the WWE name change in 2002, the championship was referred to as the "World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Tag Team Championship". After a period where the championship was to be freely defended on either WWE Monday Night Raw or WWE Thursday Night Smackdown the championship became exclusive to the Raw Brand. The current General Manager at this time Stephanie McMahon created new WWE Tag Team Titles which were to be exclusive to the Smackdown Brand.
