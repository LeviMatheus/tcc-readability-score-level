It tells the story of Stephen Dedalus, a young man who is trying to be an artist in Dublin. The story begins from his childhood and ends with him deciding to go to Paris and leave Dublin, his hometown, to become an artist.
The book is written in a new style of writing called stream of consciousness. Therefore the beginning of the book is very simple while the later parts become less simple. It shows how, when a person grows up, the language he or she uses becomes more and more complex.
