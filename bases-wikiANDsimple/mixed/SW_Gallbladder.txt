The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ in your abdomen that stores about 50 ml of acidic liquid (bile) until the body needs it for digestion. The gallbladder is about 7-10cm long in humans and is dark green in color because of the bile in it, not its tissue. It is connected to the liver and the duodenum by the biliary tract.
