Porphyria is the name for certain medical conditions or diseases. Those who suffer from the disease can not make certain substances in the blood. The condition may be because of a genetic deficiency or because it was acquired in some way. This will manifest in either skin problems, or some diseases of the nervous system, or both. Drugs are available that can at least treat the symptoms. This disease is most common in European countries and often affects the skin. When someone is affected by Porphyria they will start to lose their hair about two weeks after having an attack. There is no cure for the hair loss, however, there is medication available to help prevent attacks.
