British Rail class D3/12 was a class of three diesel electric shunting locomotives built by the Southern Railway in 1937. They were numbered 1 to 3 in a separate list from the SR's steam locomotives. They were later renumbered by British Railways 15201â€“15203. Twenty-six further engines of a similar design were built after nationalisation as British Rail Class 12.
