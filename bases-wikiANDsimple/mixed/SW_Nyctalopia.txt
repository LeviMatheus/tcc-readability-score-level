Nyctalopia (Greek for Night blindness) is a disease of the human eyes. People who are night blind are not able to see in the dark or have great difficulty to see in the dark. Sometimes the disease is there since birth, and sometimes it is caused in life by external factors (like for example a wounding of the eyes, or a diseases of the retina,or a lack of Vitamin A).
