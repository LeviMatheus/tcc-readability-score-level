Rick Hansen (August 26, 1957) is a Canadian athlete and activist. He was paralyzed in an accident at the age of 15. Inspired by his friend Terry Fox, who tried to run across Canada after losing a leg to cancer, he set out on a trip to travel around the world, in his wheelchair; it was called the "Man in Motion" tour. The money he raised from that tour went to help spinal cord injury research and parapelgic sports. He still works and does charity to raise money & awareness.
