Animals are awake for some hours each day or night. They are awake when they do not sleep. When they change from being "asleep" to being awake, it is said that they wake up, or awaken.
Animals which are awake during the day are called "diurnal". Animals which are awake during the night are called "nocturnal".
Diurnal animals, including humans, wake up in the morning, and are awake during the day. During the day they eat and move about. People may work or go to school during the day.
At night, people usually sleep. They go to sleep in a bed, or a similar place, and dream. Sometimes they cannot remember their dreams, but sometimes they remember their dreams. Sometimes they dream about the opposite sex and have what is known as a wet dream.
