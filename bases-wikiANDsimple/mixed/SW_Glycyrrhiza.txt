"Glycyrrhiza" is a genus of about 18 accepted species in the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae), with a subcosmopolitan distribution in Asia, Australia, Europe, and the Americas. It is best known for liquorice (British English; licorice in American English), which is the product of "G. glabra", a species native to the Mediterranean region. Very little "G. glabra" is grown in North America, but American Licorice "G. lepidota" is a common native species there. Russian Liquorice ("G. echinata") and Chinese Liquorice ("G. uralensis", Chinese: "gāncǎo", 甘草; lit. "sweet grass" or "sweet herb") are also cultivated, the latter being important in traditional Chinese medicine.
