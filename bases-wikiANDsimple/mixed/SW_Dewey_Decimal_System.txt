The Dewey Decimal System is a way to sort books. It's usually used in public libraries and schools. It sorts the books by subject using numbers from 000 to 999. Each subject has its own set of numbers. The system was created by Melvil Dewey in 1876. It is also called the Dewey Decimal Classification.
Each subject is broken up into 10 smaller, more specific categories.
