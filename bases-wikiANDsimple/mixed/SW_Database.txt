A Database is a program for a computer. It is used to manage data. A very simple example of a database would be an electronic address book.
The data in a database is organised in some way. Before there were computers, empolyee data was often kept ih file cabinets. There was usually one card for each employee. On the card, information such as the date of birth or the name of the employee could be found. A database also has such "cards". To the user, the card will look the same as it did in old times, only this time it will be on the screen. To the computer, the information on the card can be stored in different ways. Each of these ways is known as a database model. The most ocmomnly used database model is called "relational database model"; it used relations and sets to store the data. Normal users talking about the database model will not talk about realtions, they will talk about database tables.
Changing data.
In databases, some data changes occasionally. There may be problems when data is changed, an error might have occcurred. The error might make the data useless. The databasse system looks that the data always makes sense. It does this by using something called a transaction. There are two points in time in the database, the time before the data was changed, and the time after the data was changed. If something goes wrong when changing the data, the database system simply put the database back into the state before the change happened. This is called "rollback". After all the changes could be done successfully, they are "committed". This means that the data makes sense again; committed changes can no longer be undone
Database model.
There are different ways how to represent the data.
Ways to organise the data.
Based on these criteria, a method called Database normalisation was developed. Currently there are 5 Normal forms. These are a way to make a database faster, and make the data take less space.
