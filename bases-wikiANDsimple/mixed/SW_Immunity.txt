Immunity is being able to keep from getting sick from a certain disease. All animals have some immunities, but not much is known about the immune abilities of animals that are not mammals. People can be immunised from some diseases by having a vaccination
(injection of some dead or weakened virus, or bacteria that causes the disease). By doing so, the body learns how the virus/bacteria harms the body, and will react more quickly to fight the virus/bacteria when it comes in contact with the virus/bacteria again. When your body has defended itself against the virus/bacteria it will trap the certain virus/bacteria in a "net" so when the virus/bacteria comes back it will be easier to trap those viruses/bacteria as well.
