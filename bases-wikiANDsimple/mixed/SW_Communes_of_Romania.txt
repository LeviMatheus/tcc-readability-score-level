A commune ("comunÄƒ" in Romanian) is the second lowest level of division in Romania. There are 2,686 communes in Romania. There is no set limit to population in the communes, but once they exceed a population of 10,000 people, the commune gets the status of a city. The first lowest level of division in Romania is called "sat". "Satele" (pl.) are for the "comuna" just like the counties for the state.
