Mmhmm is the Fourth album released by Relient k it has other spellings because it's a strange word it's different to the bands previous albums, because it's heavier but also softer at times with the music.
It marks the time where the band became more serious, using fewer Joke songs than before.
Two things should be noted here: It was their first album on their record label capitol records. It was also the last CD which Brian pitman (Relient k bassist) recorded with the band.
The album was released again, and contained a song which was first found on an EP
In 2005, the album was given gold stats, because it had sold half a million copies in america
The album had a few singles which were played only on Christian radio such as High of 75 and I so hate consequences
