Meng Tian (Chinese: 蒙恬 ? - 210 BC) was a Chinese general of the Qin Dynasty under Emperor Qin Shi Huang. His grandfather, Meng Ao, and his father, Meng Wu, were generals as well. After the unification of China, Emperor Qin Shi Huang ordered Meng Tian leading 300,000 armies to attack the Xiongnu and build the Great Wall of China. Meng Tian was forced by the eunuch, Zhao Gao, to kill himself by drinking poisonous wine after the death of Emperor Qin Shi Haung.
