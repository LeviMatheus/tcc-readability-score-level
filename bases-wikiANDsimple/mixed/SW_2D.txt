2D or Two Dimensional uses two parameters: width and length. Two dimensional objects do not have depth. It's a mathematics tool, but it's also used in video games, and computer science in general.
Throughout maths, it is used in geometry and other categories.
In video games, it is used as a perspective, like in Grand Theft Auto 1 and 2.
