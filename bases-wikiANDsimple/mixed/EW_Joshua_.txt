Joshua () or Jehoshua ( "Yəhōšūaʿ") functioned as Moses' assistant in the books of Exodus and Numbers, and later succeeded Moses as leader of the Israelite tribes in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Joshua. His name was Hoshea ( "Hōšēaʿ") the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, but Moses called him "Joshua", the name by which he is commonly known in English. According to the Bible he was born in Egypt prior to the Exodus.
The Hebrew Bible identifies Joshua as one of the twelve spies of Israel sent by Moses to explore the land of Canaan. In Numbers 13:1, and after the death of Moses, he led the Israelite tribes in the conquest of Canaan, and allocated lands to the tribes. According to biblical chronology, Joshua lived some time in the Bronze Age. According to Joshua 24:29, Joshua died at the age of 110.
Joshua holds a position of respect among Muslims. According to Islamic tradition, he was, along with Caleb, one of the two believing spies whom Moses had sent to spy the land of Canaan.
Muslims also see Joshua as the leader of the faithful following the death of Moses. Some Muslims also believe Joshua to be the "attendant" of Moses mentioned in the Quran before Moses meets Khidr. Joshua plays a role in Islamic literature, with significant narration in the hadith.
Name.
The English name "Joshua" is a rendering of the Hebrew language "Yehoshua", interpreted in Christian theology as "Yahweh is salvation". This requires a different vocalization of the second name component, reading it as related to Hoshea—the name used in the Torah before Moses added the divine name. The modern linguistic analysis of the name, however, is "Yahweh is lordly".
"Jesus" is the English derivative of the Greek transliteration of "Yehoshua" via Latin. In the Septuagint, all instances of the word "Yehoshua" are rendered as "" (Iēsoūs), the closest Greek pronunciation of the . Thus, in modern Greek, Joshua is called "Jesus son of Naue" () to differentiate him from Jesus. This is also true in some Slavic languages following the Eastern Orthodox tradition (e.g. "", "Iisús Navín", in Bulgarian, Serbian and Russian, but not Czech).
Biblical narrative.
The Exodus.
Joshua was a major figure in the events of the Exodus. He was charged by Moses with selecting and commanding a militia group for their first battle after exiting Egypt, against the Amalekites in Rephidim, in which they were victorious.
He later accompanied Moses when he ascended biblical Mount Sinai to commune with God, visualize God's plan for the Israelite tabernacle and receive the Ten Commandments. Joshua was with Moses when he descended from the mountain, heard the Israelites' celebrations around the Golden Calf, and broke the tablets bearing the words of the commandments. Similarly, in the narrative which refers to Moses being able to speak with God in his tent of meeting outside the camp, Joshua is seen as custodian of the tent ('tabernacle of meeting') when Moses returned to the Israelite encampment. However, when Moses returned to the mountain to re-create the tablets recording the Ten Commandments, Joshua was not present, as the biblical text states 'no man shall come up with you'.
Later, Joshua was identified as one of the twelve spies sent by Moses to explore and report on the land of Canaan, and only he and [[Caleb]] gave an encouraging report, a reward for which would be that only these two of their entire generation would enter the promised land.
According to Joshua 1:1, God appointed Joshua to succeed Moses as leader of the Israelites along with giving him a blessing of invincibility during his lifetime. The first part of the book of Joshua covers the period when he led the conquest of [[Canaan]].
Conquest of Canaan.

At the [[Jordan River]], the waters parted, as they had for Moses at the [[Red Sea]]. The first battle after the crossing of the Jordan was the [[Battle of Jericho]]. Joshua led the destruction of [[Jericho]], then moved on to [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], a small neighboring city to the west. However, they were defeated with thirty-six Israelite deaths. The defeat was attributed to [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]] taking an "accursed thing" from Jericho; and was followed by Achan and his family and animals being stoned to death to restore God's favor. Joshua then went to defeat Ai.
The Israelites faced an alliance of five [[Amorite]] kings from [[Jerusalem]], [[Hebron]], [[Jarmuth]], [[Lachish]], and [[Eglon, Canaan|Eglon]]. At [[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]], Joshua asked Yahweh to cause the sun and moon to stand still, so that he could finish the battle in daylight. According to the text, the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day. This event is most notable because "There has been no day like it before or since, when the Lord heeded the voice of a man, for the Lord fought for Israel." God also fought for the Israelites in this battle, for he hurled huge hailstones from the sky which killed more Canaanites than those which the Israelites slaughtered. From there on, Joshua was able to lead the Israelites to several victories, securing much of the land of Canaan. He presided over the Israelite gatherings at [[Gilgal]] and [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] which [[Land lottery|allocated land]] to the tribes of Israel (Joshua 14:1–5 and 18:1–10), and the Israelites rewarded him with the Ephraimite city of [[Timnath-heres]] or Timnath-serah, where he settled (Joshua 19:50).
According to the [[Talmud]], Joshua in his book enumerated only those towns on the frontier.
Death.

When he was "old and well advanced in years", Joshua convened the elders and chiefs of the Israelites and exhorted them to have no fellowship with the native population, because it could lead them to be unfaithful to God. At a general assembly of the clans at [[Shechem]], he took leave of the people, admonishing them to be loyal to their God, who had been so mightily manifested in the midst of them. As a witness of their promise to serve God, Joshua set up a great stone under an oak by the sanctuary of God. Soon afterward he died, at the age of 110, and was buried at [[Timnath-heres]], in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
Historicity.
The prevailing scholarly view is that Joshua is not a factual account of historical events. The apparent setting of Joshua is the 13th century BCE which was a time of widespread city-destruction, but with a few exceptions ([[Tel Hazor|Hazor]], [[Tel Lachish|Lachish]]) the destroyed cities are not the ones the Bible associates with Joshua, and the ones it does associate with him show little or no sign of even being occupied at the time. Given its lack of historicity, Carolyn Pressler in her commentary for the "Westminster Bible Companion" series suggests that readers of Joshua should give priority to its theological message ("what passages teach about God") and be aware of what these would have meant to audiences in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE. [[Richard D. Nelson|Richard Nelson]] explained that the needs of the [[Centralisation|centralised]] monarchy favoured a single story of origins, combining old traditions of an [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], belief in a [[national god]] as "divine warrior," and explanations for ruined cities, [[social stratification]] and ethnic groups, and contemporary tribes.
In the 1930s [[Martin Noth]] made a sweeping criticism of the usefulness of the Book of Joshua for history. Noth was a student of [[Albrecht Alt]], who emphasized [[form criticism]] and the importance of [[Origin myth|etiology]]. Alt and Noth posited a peaceful movement of the Israelites into various areas of Canaan, "[[Contra (citation signal)|contra]]" the Biblical account.
[[William F. Albright|William Foxwell Albright]] questioned the "tenacity" of etiologies, which were key to Noth's analysis of the campaigns in Joshua. Archaeological evidence in the 1930s showed that the city of [[Ai (Canaan)|Ai]], an early target for conquest in the putative Joshua account, had existed and been destroyed, but in the 22nd century BCE. Some alternate sites for Ai have been proposed which would partially resolve the discrepancy in dates, but these sites have not been widely accepted. In 1951 [[Kathleen Kenyon]] showed that Jericho was from the [[Middle bronze age|Middle Bronze Age]] (c. 2100–1550 BCE), not the [[Late Bronze Age]] (c. 1550–1200 BCE). Kenyon argued that the early Israelite campaign could not be historically corroborated, but rather explained as an etiology of the location and a representation of the Israelite settlement.
In 1955, [[G. Ernest Wright]] discussed the correlation of archaeological data to the early Israelite campaigns, which he divided into three phases per the Book of Joshua. He pointed to two sets of archaeological findings that "seem to suggest that the biblical account is in general correct regarding the nature of the late thirteenth and twelfth-eleventh centuries in the country" (i.e., "a period of tremendous violence"). He gives particular weight to what were then recent digs at Hazor by [[Yigael Yadin]].
The Book of Joshua holds little historical value. The archaeological evidence shows that [[Jericho]] and [[Ai (Canaan)|Ai]] were not occupied in the Near Eastern [[Late Bronze Age]]. The story of the conquest perhaps represents the nationalist [[propaganda]] of the 8th century BCE kings of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] and their claims to the territory of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]], incorporated into an early form of Joshua written late in the reign of king [[Josiah]] (reigned 640–609 BCE). The book was probably revised and completed after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|fall of Jerusalem]] to the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 586 BCE, and possibly after the return from the [[Babylonian exile]] in 538 BCE.

In rabbinical literature.
In [[rabbinic literature]] Joshua is regarded as a faithful, humble, deserving, wise man. Biblical verses illustrative of these qualities and of their reward are applied to him. "He that waits on his master shall be honored" is construed as a reference to Joshua, as is also the first part of the same verse, "Whoso keeps the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof" That "honor shall uphold the humble in spirit" is proved by Joshua's victory over [[Amalek]]. Not the sons of [[Moses]]—as Moses himself had expected—but Joshua was appointed as Moses' successor. Moses was shown how Joshua reproved that [[Othniel Ben Kenaz|Othniel]].
"God would speak to Moses face to face, like someone would speak to his friend. Then he would return to the camp. But his attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, would not leave the tent. Joshua never moved from the tent". Didn't Joshua leave the tent to eat, sleep or attend to his needs? This praise shows that Joshua had complete faith in Moses, the [[Tzaddik]]. One who has this faith is cognizant of the tzaddik in everything he does; he remains steadfastly with the tzaddik whatever he does.
According to [[rabbinic tradition]], Joshua, when dividing the [[Land of Canaan]] among the twelve tribes of Israel, planted [[Sea squill]] () to mark off the [[butts and bounds]] of tribal properties.
Moreover, Joshua, on dividing the land of Canaan amongst the tribes of Israel, made the tribes agree to ten conditions, the most important of which being the common use of the forests as pasture for cattle, and the common right of fishing in the [[Sea of Tiberias]]. Natural springs were to be used for drinking and laundry by all tribes, although the tribe to which the water course fell had the first rights. Prickly burnet ("[[Sarcopoterium|Sarcopoterium spinosum]]") and the camelthorn ("[[Alhagi maurorum]]") could be freely collected as firewood by any member of any tribe, in any tribal territory.
In prayer.

According to Jewish religious tradition, upon making [[Aliyah]] by crossing the Jordan River to enter the [[Land of Israel]], Joshua composed the [[Aleinu]] prayer thanking God. This idea was first cited in the [[Kol Bo]] of the late 14th Century. Several medieval commentators noticed that Joshua's shorter birth name, Hosea, appears in the first few verses of Aleinu in reverse acrostic: ע – עלינו, ש – שלא שם, ו – ואנחנו כורעים, ה – הוא אלוקינו. The Teshuvot HaGeonim, a [[Geonic]] responsum, discussed that Joshua composed the Aleinu because although the Israelites had made Aliyah to the [[Promised Land]], they were surrounded by other peoples, and he wanted the Jews to draw a clear distinction between themselves, who knew and accepted the sovereignty of God, and those nations of the world which did not. In the modern era, religious Jews still pray the Aliyah inspired Aleinu three times daily, including on the [[High Holidays]]. The Aleinu prayer begins:

In Christianity.
Most modern Bibles translate to identify Jesus as a better Joshua, as Joshua led Israel into the rest of [[Canaan]], but Jesus leads the people of God into "God's rest". Among the early [[Church Fathers]], Joshua is considered a [[typology (theology)|type]] of Jesus Christ.
The story of Joshua and the Canaanite kings is also alluded to in the [[Meqabyan#Second Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (Meqabyan 2)|2 Meqabyan]], a book considered [[Orthodox Tewahedo biblical canon|canonical]] in the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]].
In Islam.
[[File:Prophet Joshua Name.svg|thumb|Joshua in Arabic calligraphy]]
Joshua (, "Yūšaʿ ibn Nūn", [[Help:IPA/Arabic|/juːʃaʕ ibn nuːn/]]) is not mentioned by name in the [[Quran]], but his name appears in other Islamic literature. In the Quranic account of the conquest of Canaan, Joshua and Caleb are referenced, but not named, as two "Allah-fearing men", on whom [[God in Islam|Allah]] "had bestowed His grace".
Joshua was regarded by some classical scholars as the prophetic successor to [[Moses in Islam|Moses]] (). [[Tabari]] relates in his "[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]" that Joshua was one of the twelve spies and Muslim scholars believe that the two believing spies referred to in the Quran are Joshua and Caleb. Joshua was exceptional among the [[Israelites]] for being one of the few faithful followers of Allah.
Joshua is further mentioned in [[Islamic literature]], and significant events from his Muslim narratives include the crossing of the [[Jordan river]] and the conquest of "[[Bait al-Maqdis]]".
The traditional Muslim commentary "al-Jalalayn" says, "Ahmad [b. Hanbal] reported in his Musnad, the [following] hadīth, 'The sun was never detained for any human, except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House [of Jerusalem]'."
Muslim literature includes traditions of Joshua not found in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Joshua is credited with being present at Moses's death and literature records that Moses's garments were with Joshua at the time of his departure. In [[Sahih Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]], Joshua is mentioned as Yusha' bin Nun and is the attendant to Moses during his [[Moses in Islam#Meeting with Khidr|meeting with Khidr]].
Tombs.
Joshua is believed by some Muslims to be buried on [[Joshua's Hill]] in the [[Beykoz]] district of [[Istanbul]]. Alternative traditional sites for his tomb are situated in [[Israel]] (the Shia shrine at [[Al-Nabi Yusha']]), [[Jordan]] (An-Nabi Yusha’ bin Noon, a Sunni [[mazar (mausoleum)|shrine]] near the city of [[Al-Salt]]), [[Iran]] (Historical cemetery of Takht e Foolad in Esfahan) and [[Iraq]] (the Nabi Yusha' shrine of [[Baghdad]]). A local tradition combining three versions of three different Yushas, including biblical Joshua, places the tomb inside a cave in the Tripoli Mountains, overlooking the coastal town of [[Miniyeh|el-Minyieh]] near [[Tripoli, Lebanon]]
In art and literature.
In the literary tradition of medieval Europe, Joshua is known as one of the [[Nine Worthies]]. In "[[The Divine Comedy]]" Joshua's spirit appears to Dante in the Heaven of Mars, where he is grouped with the other "warriors of the faith."
[[Baroque]] composer [[Georg Frideric Handel]] composed the [[oratorio]] "[[Joshua (oratorio)|Joshua]]" in 1747. Composer [[Franz Waxman]] composed an oratorio "Joshua" in 1959. [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]] composed "Josue" (H.404 and H.404 a), an oratorio for soloists, double chorus, double orchestra and continuo, in 1680.
In science.
Legend has it that [[Mormons|Mormon]] pioneers in the United States first referred to the "[[yucca brevifolia]]" agave plant as the Joshua tree because its branches reminded them of Joshua stretching his arms upward in supplication, guiding the travelers westward.
Joshua is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of snake, [[Joshua's blind snake]] ("Trilepida joshuai"), the [[holotype]] of which was collected at [[Jericó, Antioquia]], [[Colombia]].
Holidays.
[[File:Yom HaAliyah Poster.jpg|thumb|Israeli poster celebrating Yom HaAliyah (Aliyah Day) from the Yosef Matisyahu Collection]]
The annual commemoration of Joshua's [[Yartzeit|yahrtzeit]] (the anniversary of his death) is marked on the 26th of [[Nisan]] on the [[Hebrew calendar]]. Thousands make the pilgrimage to the [[Kifl Haris#Tomb of Joshua|Tomb of Joshua]] at Kifl Haris near [[Nablus]], [[West Bank]], on the preceding night.
[[Yom HaAliyah]] (Aliyah Day; ) is an [[Israel]]i national holiday celebrated annually on the tenth of the [[Hebrew]] month of [[Nisan]] to commemorate Joshua having led the Israelites across the Jordan River into the Land of Israel while carrying the [[Ark of the Covenant]].
