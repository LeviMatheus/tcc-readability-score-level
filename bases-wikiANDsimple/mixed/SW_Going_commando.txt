Going commando means not to wear underwear.
Going commando (or "to go commando" or "free balling") is the practice of not wearing underwear under one's outer clothing. The phrase and phenomenon is often used in a declaratory way ("I'm goin' commando!"), particularly by women to covertly create a frisson of sexual excitement or amusement amongst friends, sexual partners, future sexual partners, etc. Modern Western social mores generally recognise "going commando" as a "playful" behavior (akin to a mild form of exhibitionism).
