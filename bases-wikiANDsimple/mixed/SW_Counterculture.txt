Counterculture is a term used in psychology and sociology. People use it to describe a set of views that are not of the "mainstream". These values are in contrast to what the mainstream people believe. An example of a counterculture that was started in the 1960s is the culture of the hippies. This counterculture focused on drug use, sexual freedom (freedom of choice), and women's rights.
