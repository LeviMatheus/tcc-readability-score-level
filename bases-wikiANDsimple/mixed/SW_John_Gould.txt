John Gould (14 September, 1804 â€“ 3 February, 1881) was an English ornithologist (bird scientist). The Gould League (a bird group) in Australia was named after him. His knowledge of the birds now called "Darwin's finches" was a turning point in the Charles Darwin's thinking about evolution by natural selection. They are are barely mentioned in Charles Darwin's book, "On the Origin of Species".
