Digital Rights Management is a way to stop people from making copies. It works by using different computer technologies to make it hard for people to make copies. It is often used for music and movies.
Digital Rights Management is often shortened to DRM.
Why there is DRM.
If someone makes something, he or she usually has a copyright on the invention. This means the authors of the work can say how their work should be copied. People usually buy copies from the author or publisher. DRM helps stop people from making copies without buying them.
What people think about DRM.
Some people do not like Digital Rights Management. It takes away the ability to use parts of the work in a new creation, which they may be allowed to do.
Some people do not say "Digital Rights Management." They use the phrase Digital Restrictions Management, because it restricts what they can do with the work.
Some people believe that people can always find a way to break DRM. They think DRM costs a lot of money, but it does not work. They do not like DRM because it wastes money (uses more money than it needs to).
