Geography.
Hokkaido is the 2nd largest island of Japan and the 21st largest in the
world. It is about twice the size of Switzerland.
It is an island positioned between the Sea of Japan to the west, the Sea of Okhotsk to the northeast, Pacific Ocean to the southeast, and the Tsugaru Strait to the south.
It is separated from Honshu by the Tsugaru Strait, but connected by the underwater Seikan tunnel.
The Chishima Islands are occupied by Russia, but the Government of Japan still considers them Japanese.
