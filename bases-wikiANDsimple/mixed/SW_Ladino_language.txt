Ladino is a Jewish language that is close to the Spanish language. It has many old Spanish words and Hebrew words.
During the Middle Ages, many Jews lived in Spain. These Jews were called Sephardic Jews or "Sephardim" (in Hebrew). They were forced to leave Spain after the country was taken over by Christians, and they brought this old Spanish with them to the countries they ran away to. Today some Sephardic Jews still speak Ladino in Israel, Turkey, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United States, and other countries.
Ladino is written using the Hebrew alphabet.
