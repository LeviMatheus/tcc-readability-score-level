Toller Cranston (born April 20, 1949 in Hamilton, Ontario) is a Canadian figure skater.
Cranston grew up in Kirkland Lake, Ontario. He was Canadian champion six times, and, despite never coming higher than third at a world championship, he came first in the free skate four times. He was well-respected for his artistic ability, and is recognized as someone who brought a new level of artistry to men's figure skating.
He skated as a professional for many years, choreographed (designed movement patterns for) skating routines, and was a commentator (talked about events) on T.V. during skating events. Today he is a painter; sometimes he paints about skating.
