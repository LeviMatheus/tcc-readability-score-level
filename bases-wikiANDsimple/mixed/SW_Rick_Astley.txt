Richard Paul Astley (born February 6, 1966) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He was born in Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, England. Astley has also lived in Richmond, in Surrey with his Danish girlfriend, Lene Bausager, and their daughter, Emilie.
Career.
In 1985, Astley was a drummer with a soul band named FBI when Pete Waterman noticed him and persuaded him to come to London to work at the PWL recording studio.
His first single was the little-known "When You Gonna," released as a collaboration with Lisa Carter, but his first solo offering was "Never Gonna Give You Up," released in 1987 which spent five weeks at the top of the British charts and becoming the year's highest-selling single. On 12 March 1988, "Never Gonna Give You Up" also topped the U.S. singles chart and was followed by a second U.S. #1 on 18 June with his second U.S. single release, "Together Forever." In 1989 he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best New Artist of the Year. He lost to Tracy Chapman.
Much later, thanks to the rick rolling phenomenon and the persistant voting of the website 4chan, he was also nominated for the Best Act Ever Award 2008 at the Liverpool Music Awards.
Rickroll internet phenomenon.
In 2007 Rick Astley became the subject of a viral Internet meme in which an estimated 25 million Internet users were tricked into watching Rick Astley's video "Never Gonna Give You Up" by posting it under the name of other popular video titles. The practice is now known as Rickrolling. The phenomenon became so popular that on April 1, 2008, YouTube pranked its users by making every single featured video on the front page a Rickroll.
