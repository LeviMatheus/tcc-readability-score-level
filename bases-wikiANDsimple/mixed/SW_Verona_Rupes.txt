Verona Rupes is a cliff on Miranda, a moon of Uranus. The cliff has been estimated at 5 kilometers (3 mi) and 20 kilometers (12.4 mi) high, making it the tallest known cliff in the solar system.
It may have been created by a major impact, which caused the moon to disrupt and reassemble, or by the crust rifting.
