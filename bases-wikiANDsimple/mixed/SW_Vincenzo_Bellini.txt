Vincenzo Bellini (born in Catania on November 3 1801; died near Paris on September 23 1835) was an Italian composer. He was one of the most important opera composers of the early 19th century. He gave his singers beautiful melodies to sing, with sensitive orchestral accompaniments. He never married, although he had some passionate love affairs, and he argued a lot with other composers such as Donizetti. His greatest operas are "I puritani", "La sonnambula" and "Norma". In the 1950s famous recordings were made of these operas by the legendary soprano Maria Callas.
