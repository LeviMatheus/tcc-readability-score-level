The Liberal Party of Australia (Liberals, or LIB for short), in coalition with the National Party of Australia (Nationals, or NAT for short), is one of the two main political groups in Australian politics (the other being the Australian Labor Party). The Liberals/Nationals are the more conservative of the two main parties. It was founded by Sir Robert Menzies in 1944. The current Liberal leader is Brendan Nelson. The Liberal/National coalition is currently in opposition in Australia, having lost the most recent Australian federal election held on November 24, 2007 to the ALP, after 11 years in government under the previous Liberal Prime Minister, John Howard.
