Table salt, often called "cooking salt" or just "salt" is widely used in cooking to add flavor to food.
It is a compound (mixture) of two chemical elements, "sodium" (symbol: Na) and "chlorine" (Cl). This is why it has the chemical name "sodium chloride" (symbol: NaCl).
In history, salt was very expensive, and was used to preserve food from going bad. It was even used as money in some places.
Sodium chloride is also special because its crystals are almost perfect cubes.
