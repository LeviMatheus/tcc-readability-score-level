The Retiro Park is the best known park in Madrid. It was planned in 1632 as palace gardens by King Felipe IV. 'Retiro' means retreat or a place to rest.
When it was first built, it was far away from the city. Now, it is in the very center of the city. It was opened to the public in 1868.
In it you can find a famous rose garden, a museum, a boating lake and the Crystal Palace. Many shows and street theaters can be seen at the park on weekends.
