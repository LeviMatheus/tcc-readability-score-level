LGBT is an acronym. It means Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender.
So it can be written LGBTIQTS. Some people add Ally (someone not LGBT but who supports LGBT people.) Not everyone agrees what should be in the acronym.
This is a community. A community is a group of people who have something in common. It can also be referred to as the queer community.
