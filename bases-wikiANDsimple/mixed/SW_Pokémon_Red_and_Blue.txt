They were first released for the Game Boy in Japan in 1996. They were later released to the rest of the world in 1998 (North America) and 1999 (Europe and Australia.) "Pokémon Yellow", a special version, was released one year later in each region. These three games ("Pokémon Red", "Blue", and "Yellow",) and "Pokémon Stadium", make up the first generation of "Pokémon" video game series. "Pokémon Red" and "Blue" have later been remade for the Game Boy Advance into "Pokémon FireRed" and "LeafGreen", released in 2004.
The games are set in the fantasy world of Kanto and follow the adventure of the main character, Red, in his quest to learn Pokémon battling. Both games have almost the same plot, but the player must trade among the two in order to complete the games' Pokédexes. The Kanto Saga of the Pokémon anime is based on the games' plots.
"Pokémon Red" and "Blue" got good reviews, and their releases started the beginning of what would become a multi-billion dollar company, both selling millions of copies around the world.
