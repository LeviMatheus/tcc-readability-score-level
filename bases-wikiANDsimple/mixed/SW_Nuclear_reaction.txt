A nuclear reaction is a process from physics. In it, two or more particles collide. The result are new particles which are different from the original ones. In the case of radioactivity this reaction is spontaneous. It can also be done on purpose, to make energy. This energy can then be used for different things, for example to make electricity (as in a nuclear power plant). It can also be used as fuel for a bomb.
In the example figure 6Li reacts with deuterium. This makes Beryllium which then decays into two alpha particles.
