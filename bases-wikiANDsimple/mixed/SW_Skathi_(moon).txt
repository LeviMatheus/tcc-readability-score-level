Skathi or Saturn XXVII, is a moon of Saturn. It was found by Brett Gladman,Kavelaars, et al. in 2000, and given the designation S/2000 S 8.
Skathi is about 6.4 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Saturn at an average distance of 15,576,000 km in 725.784 days, at an inclination of 149° to the ecliptic (150° to Saturn's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.246.
Skathi may have been formed from debris knocked off of Phoebe by big impacts at some point in the solar system's history.
Its name comes from Norse mythology, where Skaði is a giantess (female giant) who is the wife of the Vanir god Niord.
