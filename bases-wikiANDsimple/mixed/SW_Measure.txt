To measure something is to give a number to some property of the thing. Measuring something puts the amount of the thing into numbers.
What can be Measured?
One can measure many other things.
Units of Measurement.
Most properties are measured using a number and a unit of measurement. The unit of measurement is a standard amount. The number compares the property to that standard amount. This means a tree that is ten times as tall as a meter stick is 10 meters tall.
Measure Theory.
There is an advanced part of mathematics that is about measuring things with unusual characteristics. This is called measure theory.
