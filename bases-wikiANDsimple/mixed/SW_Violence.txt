Violence is a term used to describe attacking people. It is the opposite of friendly behavior.
Good violence.
Some people tell that violence can be good or allowed. They say that violence is allowed when someone defends themselves from not allowed violence or when an army or a soldier under control by a nation fights or defends against others under the general laws and idea of world law. But, violence is always violence, it does not matter if it is justified or not. It should't be confused with aggression.
Bad violence.
Violence can also be illegitimate or not justified when violence is not provoked and/or not justified.
Differences.
It is hard to decide if violence is justified or not. This is because it is hard to decide who is the victim and who is the aggressor. Sometimes, economic and social aspects help to determine this.
