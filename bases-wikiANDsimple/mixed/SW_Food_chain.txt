This is a diagram that shows the movement of food and materials from the producers or those who make their own food (like plants) in an ecosystem to the consumers or those who eat other things (like animals)a chain describes the movement of energy by showing only one of the ways that food can go through the chain. A rule of the food chain is that when moving closer to the consumers the amount of energy and food is less. Usually the food chain will start with the primary producer and ends with animal which is most likely the carnivores.
The energy from the Sun's rays is used to make food in the leaves of plants via photosynthesis. The plants are called producers as already mentioned. These plants are then eaten by primary consumers. In turn, these primary consumers are eaten by secondary consumers. Further consumers may exist (tertiary, quaternary...etc) that will continue to consume other organisms.
The Food Chain Means Animals Eating Other Animals (Biggest to Smallest)
