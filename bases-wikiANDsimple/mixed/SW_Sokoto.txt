Sokoto is a city in the northwest of Nigeria, near to where the Sokoto River and Rima River meet. The people in Sokoto are mostly Muslims. Sokoto was the capital city of Gobir from the 10th century. Sokoto was made as a caliphate, an Islamic state, in the 19th century.
From around 1900, the British took control of Sokoto, which then made up a large part of the north-west corner of Nigeria. Sokoto became a province (area) of the British colony of Nigeria.
