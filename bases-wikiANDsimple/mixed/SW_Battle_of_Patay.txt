The Battle of Patay (18 June 1429) was an important battle in the Hundred Years' War between the French and the English in north-central France. The French won and the English lost badly. Many men in the English longbow corps died many English leaders of the battle were killed or taken prisoner. This battle changed the course of the war and made the French more powerful. Joan of Arc gets credit for the victory, but most of the fighting happened when the very first men reached the field, before most of the army had arrived.
