April Fools' Day.
Every April Fools' Day, "Electronic Gaming Monthly" does an April Fools' Day joke. One of the most famous is when they said that Sonic and Tails can be found in "Super Smash Bros. Melee" if the player completes a very hard task, and for a long time after that, people thought that they really were in. Sonic later appeared in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl".
