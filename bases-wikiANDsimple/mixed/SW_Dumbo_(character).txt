Dumbo is the titular character in the Disney film Dumbo.He is an anthropomorphic elephant who has huge ears and is able to fly, using his magic feather. Much like Dopey in "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", Dumbo has no spoken lines. However,in the live-action/puppet television series "Dumbo's Circus", Dumbo was voiced by Katie Leigh.
