A Christian calendar can be any calendar used by various Christian Churches for the Church year, called "liturgical year". For example, it can be used to find out what day Easter will be on, even though it is not the same in every Church.
This should not be confused with the Gregorian calendar, a civil calendar that is used in many countries around the world.
