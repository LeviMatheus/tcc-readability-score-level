"Break a leg" is an expression, from Britain. (Here, an "expression" means: a particular way of saying something.)
It can mean, about the same, as "good luck".
This expression was used in theaters, by actors. Before an actor went on stage, other actors might wish that he (or she)
had good luck, in their work. Then, a co-worker could say: "Break a leg !".
When the expression is used like this, it is a form of irony.
