Klingons (Klingon: tlhIngan; Pronunciation: /ˈt͡ɬɪŋɑn/) are a warrior race in the fictional Star Trek universe. They were recurring main characters in "Star Trek: The Original Series" (TOS) and were later featured in all five spin-off series, eventually becoming uneasy allies of the United Federation of Planets.
Created by screenwriter Gene Coon, Klingons were introduced in the episode "Errand of Mercy" (1967). They were named for Lieutenant Wilbur Clingan, who served with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry in the Los Angeles Police Department.
In the original series, the conflict between the Federation and Klingon was intended as an allegory to the then-current Cold War tensions between the United States and the now-defunct Soviet Union. ' carried forward the Klingon militaristic traits but modeled a Klingon warrior code based loosely on bushido, a feudal-military Japanese code of behavior valuing honor above life.
