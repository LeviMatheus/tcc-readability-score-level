In mythology, Charon was the ferryman of Hades. He was the son of Erebos and Nyx.
Charon took the newly dead people across the river Acheron to the Greek underworld, if they paid him an obolus (a Greek silver coin). Because of this, people in Ancient Greece were always buried with a coin under their tongue to pay Charon. Those who could not pay him had to wander the banks of the Acheron for one hundred years.
The largest moon of the planet Pluto is named Charon after this mythological person.
