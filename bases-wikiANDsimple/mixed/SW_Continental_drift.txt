Continental drift is a theory that says that parts of the Earth's crust moves slowly or "drifts" on top of a liquid core. The theory was first proposed by the German geologist and meteorologist Alfred Wegener in 1915. The fossil record supports the theories of continental drift and plate tectonics.
