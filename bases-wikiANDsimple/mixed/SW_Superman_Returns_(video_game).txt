Superman Returns is a video game based on the movie Superman Returns. It is for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Xbox 360, Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance consoles.
Some video game websites said this game would come out for computers (PC), but Electronic Arts chose not to make a PC version of this game. There was going to be a Gamecube version, but it was cancelled because of a 2006 contract with Major League Baseball as well as to avoid competition with two other movie-licensed games (Charlotte's Web and Dreamgirls).
