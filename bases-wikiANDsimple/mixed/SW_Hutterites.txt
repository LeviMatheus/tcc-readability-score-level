Hutterites are a group of Protestan≈ß Christians. They are an anabaptist movement; they think believers should be baptized (a second time). Their movement was founded by Jacob Hutter who lived in the 16th century. The main difference to the Mennonites is that they think the bible should be read literally. They also share everything they have; there is no private property.
Today, there are about 50.000 hutterites; most of them live in the Canada and the United States. Like the Amish they still speak a dialect of German.
