3DO is the name of the video game consoles made by the 3DO company. They were released in 1993 and 1994. Its features were very ahead of its time. The 3DO was one of the worst-selling consoles in history because it was very expensive and other companies had cheaper systems. It was also not advertised very well, so no one knew about it. Some of the best games for it are "Alone in the Dark" and "Myst". The 3DO company also wanted to make another console called the M2, but it never was sold.
