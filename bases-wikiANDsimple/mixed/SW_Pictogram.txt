A Pictogram (sometime also claled pictogramme or pictograph) is a small drawing. Today, pictograms are used very often. Because they are independent of the language, they are often used where there are people who need to understand things, even if they do not speak the language.
Common uses include those for road signs, airports, and train station, and warning signs.
