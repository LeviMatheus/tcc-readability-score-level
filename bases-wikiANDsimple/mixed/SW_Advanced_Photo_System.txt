The Advanced Photo System was a technology for photographic film and cameras. People started using it in the year 1996.
The system never became popular, and was stopped in 2004. Since then, most cameras have switched to digital (electronic) systems anyway.
One famous type of camera that used this system was the Canon IXUS, which then later changed and became a digital one.
