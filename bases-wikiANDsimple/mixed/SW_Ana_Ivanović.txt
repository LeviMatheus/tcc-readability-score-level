Personal life.
Ivanović was born in Belgrade in Serbia (which used to be called Yugoslavia). She watched tennis on television when she was 5 years old, and said, "I loved watching tennis on television, particularly Monica Seles." While she was growing up, the country was bombed by NATO, so she had to arrange her training to avoid this. She would even practice tennis in an empty swimming pool during the winter. When she was 14 years old, she was asked what she dreamed of in tennis, she replied "To become the No. 1 magic player in the world." Her Serbian tennis instructor introduced her to a Swiss businessman who agreed to hire a coach and pay for Ivanović's training in Switzerland.
Her father, Miroslav, and brother, Miros, watches some of Ana's matches on television, but her mother, Dragana, goes to all of them. Ivanović and her mother, who Ivanović describes as her "best friend," live in Basel, Switzerland. Her uncle lives in Australia where Ivanović is very popular. She is studying for a degree in finance at a Belgrade university, and is learning to speak Spanish.
In 2007 she became an ambassador for the worldwide charitable organization UNICEF, saying "I'm also looking forward to going into the classroom and meeting many kids". Ivanović is also interested in fashion–she has modelled clothes and says "...I love to shop..."
Playing style.
Ivanović plays tennis holding her racket in her right hand. She also uses both hands on the racket when hitting her backhand shots. She can hit her shots from the baseline (the back of the tennis court) but is also good at volleys. Because she is very tall () she can serve the ball very fast, sometimes over. She also has a strong wrist which means she can hide what kind of serve she is going to use until the last moment. She will often shout "Ajde!" ("Come on!" in Serbian) during her matches.
Professional career.
Ivanović made it to the final of the junior version of Wimbledon in 2004, but lost to Ukrainian player Kateryna Bondarenko. She became a professional tennis player in August 2003. She finished the 2004 tennis season as one of the top 100 female players in the world. In 2005, Ivanović won her first title in the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) in Canberra, Australia, beating Hungarian player Melinda Czink. She finished 2005 in the world top 20.

Hingis got revenge for her defeat in Montreal by beating Ivanović in the final of the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, Japan, in February 2007. Ivanović won her third WTA title by beating Russian player Svetlana Kuznetsova in the German Masters tournament in Berlin in May 2007.
She got to the final of her first Grand Slam tournament in 2007 in the French Open, but she lost to Justine Henin from Belgium. She said that losing that match was her worst moment on a tennis court. However, she did end that year as one of the ten best female players in the world. In the following season, she got to the final of the Australian Open where she lost to Maria Sharapova. After the final she was the second best female player in the world. In March 2008, Ivanović beat Svetlana Kuznetsova again in another final, this time at Indian Wells in California.
