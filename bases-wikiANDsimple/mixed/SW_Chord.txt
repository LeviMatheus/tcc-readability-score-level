A chord in music is when two or more notes are played together (some text books say that it is when "three" or more notes are played).
A chord which is built up of the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes of a scale is called a "tonic triad". Any combination of notes is a chord.
Chords can be played on instruments such as piano, keyboard, organ, harp, guitar, harmonica and xylophone. Chords with two notes can be played on string instruments by bowing on two strings together. By bowing on two strings and then quickly on the other two strings a violinist can sound as if he is playing a four-part chord. Some players of wind instruments are able to make chords by playing two or more harmonics together.
