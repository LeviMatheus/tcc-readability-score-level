Rikishi (力士) is a word used to call a professional sumo wrestler. The Japanese characters making up the name mean "strong man", which is a good name as the people who take part in sumo wrestling are very strong and big.
During their careers, the sumo wrestlers live in "stables" kept by a former wrestler. The former sumo wrestler makes sure the new wrestlers who live there live a very strict life.
