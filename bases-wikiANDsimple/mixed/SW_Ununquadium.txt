Ununquadium is a chemical element. It is also named eka-lead. It has the symbol Uuq. It has the atomic number 114. It is a superheavy element. Ununquadium is radioactive
Ununquadium does not exist in nature. It has to be made. It is a synthetic element. It is made from a nuclear reaction between plutonium and calcium. The reaction that happens is a fusion reaction.
History.
The discovery of ununquadium in December 1998 was reported in January 1999 by scientists at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The same team of scientists made another isotope of Uuq three months later and made it again in in 2004 and 2006.
In 2004 in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research checked it was made by another method. They found the final products of radioactive decay.
Name.
Ununquadium is a temporary IUPAC systematic element name. It is likely to get a new name and symbol in the future.
Chemical properties.
Not enough ununpentium has beeen made to measure its physical or chemical properties. It is thought that it would be a soft, dense metal that changes colour in air. It may have a low melting point of about 200 Â°C.
Making it.
Ununquadium can be made by bombarding a plutonium-244 target with calcium-48 as a beam of ions.
