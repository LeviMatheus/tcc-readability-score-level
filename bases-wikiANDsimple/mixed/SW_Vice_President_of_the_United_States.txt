The Vice President of the United States of America is the second-in-command to the President. The President is the commander in chief. The Vice President's responsibilities include filling in for the President, and acting as president of the U.S. Senate.
Originally, the Vice President was the person who got the second most votes in the presidential election. However, after an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Vice President is elected together with the President on one platform.
The current Vice President is Dick Cheney.
The vice president only has one official duty. That is to preside over the Senate.
