In Diabetes Insipidus, there is a chemical missing from the blood that helps the body to keep liquid inside. This chemical is known as ADH, and is part of a group of blood chemicals known as Hormones. ADH is released from a part of the body called the Brain, and travels in the blood to the parts of the body that make urine, known as the Kidneys. Here, it makes the body take water out of the urine, which reduces the amount of urine stored in the bladder.
If there is no ADH in the blood, no water is taken out of the urine, and much more will be kept in the bladder. This means you need to go to the toilet more often.
