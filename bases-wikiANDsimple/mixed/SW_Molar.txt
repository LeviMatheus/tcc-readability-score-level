Molars are special teeth found in mammals, and also the most complex sort of teeth. They are used for grinding food. Humans have 12 molars in total, in four groups of three at the back of the mouth. The molar which is the farthest back in each group is called a wisdom tooth. The wisdom teeth are the last teeth to appear, usually at about the age of twenty.
