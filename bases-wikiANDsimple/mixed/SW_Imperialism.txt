Imperialism is a policy (way of governing) in which large or powerful countries hold control or authority over other regions or territories. Some large or powerful countries control other regions to create a bigger empire.
An example of imperialism is when countries conquer or settle in such lands by setting up colonies. In the 1700s and 1800s the British Empire used the policy of imperialism to control large territories such as Australia and Canada.
