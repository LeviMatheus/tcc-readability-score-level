Main characters.
Drake Parker's mother is Audrey Parker, and he lived with his single mother, along with Megan, his younger sister until she got married to weather man, walter Nichols who has a son named Josh Nichols.
Drake may be portrayed as lazy, mischievous, cool and smooth-with-the-ladies. He is said to be 15 in the first two seasons, and 16-17 in the last two seasons. Drake hates homework, and is often seen either playing a tone on his guitar(he is very talented when it comes to music!) or tuning it. Sometimes he rehearses for his concerts, which is a good excuse to not do homework! He sometimes plays pranks on Josh or does mischief, and lets Josh get the blame. Both brothers are fed up of Megan. She plays pranks on them all the time for just no reason at all, throughout the season. Drake is someone who always gets away from trouble. Josh on the other hand is the total opposite of Drake...but they still got along!
Theme song.
The start of each episode uses a song called "I Found a Way". The song is written by Drake Bell and Michael Corcoran and performed by Bell. Bell can also be seen playing the song in a quick scene from an episode in the first season. The song can also be found on the series' official soundtrack, ', and on Drake Bell's albums, "Telegraph" and "It's Only Time"
