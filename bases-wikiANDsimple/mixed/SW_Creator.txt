A Creator is a person who creates something.
In some religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) God (or Allah meaning the God in Arabic) is the most important and original Creator of the whole Universe - including Man who is made "in his image"(see Genesis) to observe it and control it like God. The idea that anything that a person is creating, like an idea, can be owned as property comes from the ethical traditions and legal codes that came from these religions.
In other traditions (Buddhism, Native American religions) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the universe. Stewardship of home, land and all of Earth is a test for participating in this, or just good sense. Sometimes this belief is not well understood, and poorly translated (such as the verb in Native American languages meaning "the greatest creating" being translated into English as Creator) by those who only understand the "Man in God's image" view. This view has often been projected onto people who do not believe in it, along with concepts of intellectual rights inappropriate for those peoples.
