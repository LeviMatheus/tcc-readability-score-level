Zircon is a silicate mineral. It is found in many, many different places in almost all kinds of rock. The chemical it is made up of is called "zirconium sulfate". Clear zircon may look like diamond and has been used as a cheaper replacement for diamond. It is not the same as cubic zirconia, which is man-made from different chemicals. In the United States, zircon is considered to be the birth stone for the month of December.
