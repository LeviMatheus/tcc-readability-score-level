In baseball, batting is the act of going against the other team's pitcher and trying to hit the baseball ball. A batter or hitter is the player who swings his bat to try to hit the ball. In Major League Baseball, pitchers usually do not bat unless they are playing in the National League where batters have to bat even if they are pitchers. In the American League, pitchers do not bat, and only pitch.
