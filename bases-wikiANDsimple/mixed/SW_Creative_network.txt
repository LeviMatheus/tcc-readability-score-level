A creative network is a loose group of people creating something in art or science or business. It is never larger than about a dozen people who may move from one project to another as a troupe or team.
They have only a few goals at a time, and never more than one major goal. Each person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the network. For instance to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough. Very often the roles and timing are determined by a power network (say the bank or studio that funds the project). However, the creative control remains within the small creative network.
