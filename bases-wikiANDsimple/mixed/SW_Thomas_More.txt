Sir Thomas More or Saint Thomas More (February 7, 1478 â€“ July 6, 1535), was an English writer, lawyer, and statesman. He held many important jobs including Speaker of the House of Commons, Lord Chancellor and advisor to the King Henry VIII. He also invented the world "utopia", which means: "an ideal place to live". This is described in a book called "Utopia". When King Henry left the Roman Catholic Church because the Pope would now allow him a divorce from his first wife, he started The Church of England. More, a devout Catholic, did not accept the King as head of the Church. Because of this, he was arrested and executed for treason. He was thought of as a martyr and made a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1935. His feast day is on June 22 and he is the patron of lawyers and politicans. A play and movie called A Man For All Seasons is based on his life.
