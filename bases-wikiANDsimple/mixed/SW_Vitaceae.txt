Vitaceae are a family of dicotyledonous flowering plants including the grape and Virginia creeper. The family name comes from the genus "Vitis". The name sometimes appears as Vitidaceae, but Vitaceae is a conserved name and therefore has priority over both Vitidaceae and another name sometimes found in the older literature, Ampelidaceae.
