Codeine or methylmorphine is an opiate used for its analgesic properties. It is also used to treat coughing and diarrhea. It is marketed as the salts codeine sulfate and codeine phosphate. Codeine hydrochloride is more commonly marketed in continental Europe and other regions.
Codeine is an alkaloid found in opium in concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 3.0 percent. Codeine can be extracted from opium. Today, most codeine is synthesized from morphine through the process of O-methylation.
Uses.
Codeine is sometimes marketed indrugs that combine it with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as co-codamol (best known in North America as Tylenol 3), with aspirin as co-codaprin or with ibuprofen. These combinations provide greater pain relief than either agent alone (drug synergy; see synergy).
