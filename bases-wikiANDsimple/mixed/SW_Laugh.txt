A laugh is a way of showing happiness. It is a noise that a person makes when he hears something funny, like a joke, or is tickled.
Sometimes people laugh when they are not happy. When people are ashamed or embarrassed, sometimes they react by laughing.
There are different ways to laugh. A person can laugh using mostly their voice, mostly their throat, or mostly their nose.
You can write a laugh in different ways. Some people write "ha ha ha", or "he he he", or "heh". If they are on the internet, they also use "LOL". "LOL" doesn't sound like a laugh, but it stands for Laughing Out Loud.
Laughter can be observed in human infants from around three or four months and is usually an expression of surprise. It often elicits a positive response in adults who will involuntarily mimic the child. Video footage on the youtube site of babies laughing were shown to HM The Queen Elizabeth during her visit to the google headquarters on 16 October 2008 where both she and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh were reduced to 'fits of giggles'.
