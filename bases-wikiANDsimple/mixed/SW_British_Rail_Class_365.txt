The British Rail Class 365 "Networker Express" are dual-voltage (25kV AC and 750V DC) electric multiple units built by ABB at York from 1994-95. These were the last units to be built at York works before it closed. All Class 365 units in service have now received front end cab modifications to equip them with cab air conditioning.
