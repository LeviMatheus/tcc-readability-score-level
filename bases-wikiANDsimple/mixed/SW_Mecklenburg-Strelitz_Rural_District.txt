Mecklenburg-Strelitz is a "Kreis" (district) in the southern part of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany. The district-free city (urban district) of Neubrandenburg is nearly completely surrounded by Mecklenburg-Strelitz district.
The capital of the duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was the town of Strelitz. In 1712 a fire completely destroyed the town. The duke decided to build a new town on the shores of a small lake called the Zierker See. This town became Neustrelitz, or in English "New Strelitz".
The district was created by joining the three old districts Neubrandenburg, Neustrelitz and Strasburg in 1994.
