A Conscientious objector (CO) is a person who decides not to be a combatant in military forces.
There are many reasons for this decision such as religious beliefs, ethical and moral beliefs to not kill human beings or pacifism.
Countries treat COs in various ways. They have also been treated differently throughout history. COs have been arrested or had to pay a fine. Some countries punished them by killing them. After World War II, many Western countries created alternative non-military services (civil service) as alternative form for pacifists. Often there were commissions to decide if someone really did not want to do armed service because of his beliefs or because of fear of war.
