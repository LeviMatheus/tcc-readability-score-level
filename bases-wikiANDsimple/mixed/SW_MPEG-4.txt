MPEG-4 is a video and audio standard. Movies in MPEG-4 need less space on a computer and at the same time they have DVD quality. MPEG means Moving Picture Experts Group. Hundreds of researchers and engineers all over the world worked to develop MPEG-4. The work on this standard ended in 1998 and in a few months MPEG-4 was made into a standard all over the world.
Movies that use MPEG-4 standard have high quality and have take up less computer room. Older standards were MPEG-1 and MPEG-2. In comparison with these older versions, MPEG-4 has additional features like having a way to fix problems, lots of quality and size choices, good picture and many more.
MPEG-4 takes into consideration special needs from computer, television areas and telecommunication. It is able to be, besides rectangular pieces of computer information, individual objects in a certain area. An example could be a car driving in front of a background. The background doesn't change. Since MPEG-4 can be many rectangular images, the car can be treated as another thing, not being a fixed background.
