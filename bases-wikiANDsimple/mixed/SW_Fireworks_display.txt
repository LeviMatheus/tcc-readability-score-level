A fireworks event (also called a fireworks display or fireworks show) is a spectacular display of the effects created by firework devices on various occasions. Fireworks events are often used during holidays. Fireworks competitions are also regularly held at a number of places.
History.
Fireworks originated in China (206 BC–AD 220) and produced the loud sound (known as Chinese: "Bian pao") that was intended to frighten evil spirits. In the Northern and Southern Dynasties (AD 420–581) the firecrackers were used not only to keep evil away but also to pray for happiness and prosperity.
