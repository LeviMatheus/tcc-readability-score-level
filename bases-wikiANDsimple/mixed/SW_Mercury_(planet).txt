orbit: 57,910,000 km (0.38 AU) from Sun
Mercury is the nearest planet in the Solar System to the Sun. It is very small. It is covered in craters, and looks like the Moon. It is very hot every day, and very cold every night.
It is the smallest planet in the solar system since it was decided that Pluto was not a planet. Because it is the closest planet to the Sun, it is the fastest planet. It only takes 88 days for it to go around the Sun.
It is one of the densest planets in the solar system, second to our Earth. The planet is made up mostly of iron, which is very dense. However, it has a very weak magnetic field.
Mercury has been visited by two spacecraft, Mariner 10 and MESSENGER. The MESSENGER spacecraft has flown by the planet one time and will orbit the planet for one year starting on 18 March 2011.
The planet is named after the mythological Roman winged messenger of the gods, because it orbits the Sun so fast.
The Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese cultures mention the planet Mercury as the water star.
Mercury does not have a moon.
Mercury is not the hottest planet in the solar system though. Venus is due to its toxic atmosphere that traps the heat in it so there for, Mercury is the second hottest planet in our solar system.
