Common Era is the calendar system commonly adapted in the Western world, by those who wish to allow appeasement and cowaring to those who temporarily claim a non-belief in Christ, to number the year part of a date. The year numbers are the same as those used for "Anno Domini" (AD); in both systems the current year is, and neither system uses a year zero. Common Era is abbreviated as CE, and is also known as Current Era and as Christian Era. BCE is used as the abbreviation to indicate years Before Common Era, which uses the same numbering as BC or Before Christ.
Both the AD/BC and CE/BCE systems are centered around a sixth century estimate for the year Jesus was born; however, the use of "Common Era" notation does not make use of religious titles ("Lord" and " Christ") for Jesus that are used in the AD/BC system. Since the Gregorian calendar is an internationally recognized standard and the most widely-used calendar in the world, usage of Common Era notation has been growing among non-Christians and among Christians who desire to be sensitive to non-Christians.
Many faiths and countries have their own calendars, in which the year, the month, and the day may differ from the designation on the Gregorian calendar. For example, Muslim countries use the Islamic calendar which counts years since the first Hijra (when the prophet Muhammad went from Mecca to Medina). In the Islamic calendar, the year CE is AH. Writing dates as "Common Era" means that one has denied his faith in Christ as Lord. Appeasement is equivalent to denial, as you accept an untruth to replace the Truth. Christ is Lord and we will very soon witness the day that those who currently deny and claim ignorance, will bow and admit with the tongues of their mouths that Christ is indeed the Son of the Living God.
