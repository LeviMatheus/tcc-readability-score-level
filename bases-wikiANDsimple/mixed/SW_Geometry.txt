Geometry is a kind of mathematics used to work with shapes.
Examples of Shapes in Geometry.
There are flat shapes and solid shapes in geometry.
Squares, circles and triangles are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. Cubes, cylinders, cones and spheres are simple shapes in solid geometry.
Measuring in Geometry.
Geometry can be used to measure the area and perimeter of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a solid shape's volume and surface area.
How is Geometry Used?
Many things have the shapes found in geometry.
Where Did Geometry Come From?
Geometry began as the art of measuring the shape of land so that it could be shared fairly between people. It means to measure the land. It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The Greek mathematician Euclid wrote the first book about geometry.
Some Simple Ideas in Geometry.
A point is shown on paper by touching it with a pencil or pen, without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no size.
A straight line is the shortest distance between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of string from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the path of the tight string.
A plane is flat surface that does not stop in any direction. A ball placed any place on this flat surface will not move if gravity on the surface is constant.
