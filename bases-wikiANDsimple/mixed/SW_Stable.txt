A stable is a building for livestock animals such as horses or cows to live in.
A stable often has a loft where food such as hay can be kept to feed the animals in the winter. The stable may be divided into enclosures or stalls to keep the animals separate.
A stable may be built near a farmhouse.
According to the Christian Bible, the baby Jesus was born in a stable. He was wrapped up and put to sleep on the straw in the feed bin (the "manger").
