Bastila Shan is a character from the "Star Wars" universe.
Bastila Shan was born in the year 3,979 BBY. She is the daughter of Helena Shan and an unknown treasure hunter who joined the Jedi Order despite her protests. She became a valuable member to the Jedi Order despite her young age due to her mastery of Battle Meditation. During the Jedi Civil War, she was responsible for the capture of Darth Revan, with whom she fell in love with. After being tortured by Darth Malak and falling to the dark side, she tried to persuade the redeemed Revan by returning to the dark side and reclaiming his rightful place. After being rejected and forced to flee to the Star Forge, Bastila confronted Revan again and lost. She begged him to kill her, but he refused and used the power of their love to bring her back to the light and help the Republic in the Battle of Rakata Prime. She is also one of the surviving Jedi to survive the purge that followed it.
