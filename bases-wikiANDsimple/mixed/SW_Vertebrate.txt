A vertebrate is an animal with a spinal cord or "spine" (sometimes called a "backbone", even though some spinal cords are surrounded by cartilage instead of bone) inside its body. The word comes from "vertabrae", the bones that make up most spines. It is the opposite of invertebrate.
Examples of vertebrates are mammals, birds, and fish. Sharks, and related skates and rays, are vertebrates with cartilage instead of bones.
