History.
The name "organic" is a historical name from the 19th century.
People believed that only living things could make organic compounds and "dead" things (such as minerals) could make inorganic compounds. However, Friedrich WÃ¶hler proved this wrong because certain compounds in urine were thought to be inorganic, but urine came from a living thing.
