School is a place (usually a building) where people are taught something. Today in most countries children have to go to school to learn basic things they will need to know in order to live in their following life. These things are taught in subjects. Each subject has its own knowledge to teach. For example: writing, reading, and calculating numbers (maths). Many schools also teach arts such as music and visual art, or humanities, like geography and history, or other languages, commonly English, French or Spanish. In some countries, you can study second, or third languages.
