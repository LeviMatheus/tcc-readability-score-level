Louis III of France (born 863â€“865, died 5 August 882), king of Western Francia, was the second son of King Louis the Stammerer and Ansgarde. He and his brother Carloman, both became king together and ruled together after his father's death in 879.
Louis won an important battle against the Viking pirates at the Battle of Saucourt-en-Vimeu, in 881. He died in August 882 at Saint Denis after falling from his horse. Because he had no children, his brother Carloman became the sole king.
