Grindcore is a type of heavy metal and hardcore punk music. It was made in the 1980's. Grindcore is a lot like black metal and death metal, but the guitar parts are very simple and are played over and over again in a song. The vocals are usually loud shouts and screams while the drums play fast and loud. In most cases, grindcore songs will be very short in length. Their lyrics are similar to death metal and hardcore punk, which usually sing about pain, suffering, blood, gore or politics, injustice and revolution.
