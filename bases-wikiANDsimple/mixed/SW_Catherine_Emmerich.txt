Sister Anne Catherine Emmerich (September 8, 1774 - February 9, 1824) was a German Augustinian nun. She is remembered for her mystical visions of Jesus' and Mary's lives. What she saw was written in books, for example, "The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord, Jesus Christ". The book later had an important part as a main source of information for Mel Gibson's movie "The Passion of the Christ".
