Ganymede is the largest moon of Jupiter, and also the largest in the Solar System. Ganymede is larger in diameter than Mercury, but has only about half its mass, as Ganymede's density is much less. Ganymede can be seen from Earth with the naked eye, if not for the brighter light of nearby Jupiter. Other than possibly the other Galilean Satellites; Io, Europa and Callisto; the only other planetary satellite visible with the naked eye is our own Moon.
Ganymede's discoverer is Galileo Galilei who confirmed its existence in 1610. The name Ganymede was suggested soon after by Simon Marius, named after the cup-bearer of the Greek gods, beloved of Zeus. This name and the names of the other Galilean satellites was not favoured for a long time, and were not put into common use until the mid-20th century. Instead, it is simply referred to by its Roman numeral designation (a system that was introduced by Galileo) as or as the "third satellite of Jupiter". Ganymede is the only Galilean moon of Jupiter named after a male figure.
