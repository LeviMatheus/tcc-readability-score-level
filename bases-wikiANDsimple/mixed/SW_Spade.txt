In gardening, a spade (shovel) is a tool. A spade is a particular kind of shovel made for digging. It has a pointed end and a straight handle. In some countries such as Australia the difference between a spade and a shovel is important. It is hard to move gravel with a spade but a proper shovel can do it.
In game, a spade is one of the four shapes on playing cards. It is coloured black and not the one that looks like cross.
