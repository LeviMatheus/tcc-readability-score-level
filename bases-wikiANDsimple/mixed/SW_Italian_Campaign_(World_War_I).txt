The Italian campaign was a series of battles fought between Austria-Hungary and Italy. These battles happened in northern Italy between the years 1915 and 1918.
Italy switched its allegiance during the war to join the side of the Allies. They hoped that by joining the Triple Entente, Italy would gain the province of Trento ("Trentino"), the port of Trieste, and the province of Bolzano-Bozen ("Alto Adige/SÃ¼dtirol"), Istria, and Dalmatia.
Italy had hoped to begin the war with a surprise attack, which was to act quickly and capture several Austrian-held cities. However, the war in Italy soon turned to trench warfare, similar to the Western Front.
