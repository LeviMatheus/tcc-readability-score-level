The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty between Portugal and Spain in 1494 where they agreed to divide up all the land on the Earth outside of Europe between the two of them, no matter who was already living there. Pope Alexander VI was the pope at the time of the treaty. He drew an imaginary line at 480 kilometers and gave Spain the land to the west Cape Verde Islands and Portugal the land to the east of it. Knig Ferdinand and Queen Isabella were the rulers of Spain at the time.
