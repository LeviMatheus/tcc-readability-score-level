Ally is a word which means a person or a group that works together with another person or a group. However, although each other works together, if one side works only for its profit and does not care about another's benefit, the one is not an ally of another one. If those two are in the relation of an 'ally,' both should take a benefit of their work, not only one, because this relationship is based on trust.
