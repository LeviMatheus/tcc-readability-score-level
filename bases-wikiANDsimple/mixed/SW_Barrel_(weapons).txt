A barrel is a part of a gun. It is a long metal tube that the bullet goes through after it is fired. Guns can have many different sizes of barrels. Usually, longer barrels mean that the bullet will hit the target more often. Barrels usually have spiral grooves on the inside of them, called rifling. Barrels with the grooves spin the bullet around fast as it exits, so the bullet is even more stable and likely to hit the target.
