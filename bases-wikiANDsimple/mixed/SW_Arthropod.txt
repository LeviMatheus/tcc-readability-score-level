Arthropods (phylum Arthropoda) are a group of invertebrates, for example centipedes, millipedes, insects, arachnids, and crustaceans. Arthropoda comes from the Greek word for "jointed feet", and it is the largest phylum of animals.
Arthropods are also a source of food for many animals, including humans. All arthropods have jointed feet, a segmented body, and an exoskeleton, a shell outside of the body. Usually, you would call an arthropod a "bug", although true bugs are a specific type of insect.
Arthropods are basically made up of 4 groups, and one extinct group. The 4 groups are: insects, arachnids, crustaceans, and myriapods. The trilobites are extinct, and they are the 2nd most famous type of fossils, after the dinosaurs.
