A puzzle is a problem to make the user think. They are often used for entertainment and can help logic skills. The user may need to recognise patterns to solve it, so those who have good logic are usually good with puzzles.
Puzzles, such as wordsearches, crosswords and Sudoku grids, are printed in newspapers and magazines, but puzzles can be with objects or even on a computer screen.
