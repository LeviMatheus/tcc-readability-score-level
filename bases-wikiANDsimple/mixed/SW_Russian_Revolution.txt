The term Russian Revolution refers mainly to the Russian Revolution of 1917, which included the February Revolution resulting in the abdication (quitting) of Czar Nicholas II and the later Bolshevik revolt of Communism, the October Revolution, that had the royal family shot.
It was the only successful workers' revolution in history insofar as ordinary workers, peasants, and soldiers of Russia took over the running of society and got rid of the pro-capitalist Kerensky government.
The revolution was ultimately strangled by international capitalism and the invading White Armiesâ€”over 15 separate armies held the Russian workers' state under siege.
Also, the failure of the revolution to spread to Germany and others places was central in the defeat of Lenin's Bolsheviks and to the rise of Stalinism and the subsequent system of state capitalism.
The term "Russian Revolution" can also mean the Russian Revolution of 1905.
When talking about time, if the comment does not say the year, the term usually refers to the October Revolution of 1917, while references to the revolution of 1905 always say the year and references to the February Revolution always say the month.
The Third Russian Revolution was the failed anarchist revolution against the Bolsheviks and the White Army from 1918 to 1922, where the anarchists tried to take over.
