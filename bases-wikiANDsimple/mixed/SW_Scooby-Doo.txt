"Scooby-Doo" is an American long-running animated series that was made for Saturday morning cartoons in many different versions from 1969 to now. The first series, that was called "Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!", was made for Hanna-Barbera Productions. Hanna-Barbera made many versions like it and other shows like it until everything was made in The WB Television Network, which has handled the production (making) of the show since then.
Though the show, people in it, and their ages have changed, the most familiar versions of the show have a talking dog named Scooby-Doo and four teenagers: Fred "Freddie" Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Norville "Shaggy" Rogers.
