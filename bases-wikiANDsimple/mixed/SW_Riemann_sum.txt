In mathematics, a Riemann sum is a sum that makes an approximation of the total area underneath a curve on a graph. The area can be known as the integral. It may also be used to define the integration operation. The sum is named after a German mathematician who was called Bernhard Riemann.
Definition.
You divide the horizontal length under the part of the function you want to evaluate into "n" equal pieces. That is the n on top of the E. The (x_-x_ represents the size of one horizontal segment that is created from dividing the whole by the "n". The f(Yi) is a y value in an "n" segment. Since the area of a rectangle =length*width, then the multiplication of x_ and f(Yi) is the area of a rectangle for that part of the graph. The E means we add up all of these little rectangles together to get an approximation of the area under the segment of a function.
