Prato is a city in Tuscany, Italy. It is the capital of the Province of Prato.
Prato's economy has been based upon the textile industry, since 1400.
Prato is also a centre of the slow food movement, with many other local specialities, including cantucci, a type of biscotti.
Since the late 1950s, the city has had a big amount of immigration, first from southern Italy, then other countries. Since the late 1980s a large Han community has settled in the city. With a population of more than 180,000 people, Prato is Tuscany's second largest city. It is the third largest in Central Italy, after Rome and Florence.
History.
In 1512 the city was attacked by the Spanish troops sent by Pope Julius II to capture the nearby city of Florence for the Medici family. The attack caused much damage to Prato. It led to the surrender of the Florentine Republic and control by the Medici family. The army killed 50,600 citizens of Prato in the streets.
