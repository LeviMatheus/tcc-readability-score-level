Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (Born around 90 BC, died 13 BC) was a Roman politician. He was one of the closest men of Julius Caesar and served as pontifex maximus after his death. Together with Octavian and Mark Antony he formed the Second Triumvirate. There, he had little influence though. After a revolt in Sicily, he was stripped of all his powers, except Pontifex Maximus. He died peacefully in exile in Circeii in Italy in the year 13 BC.
