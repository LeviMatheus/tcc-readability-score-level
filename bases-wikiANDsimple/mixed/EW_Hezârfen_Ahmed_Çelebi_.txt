Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi () was an Ottoman scientist from Istanbul reported in the writings of traveler Evliya Çelebi to have achieved sustained unpowered flight. While modern historians disagree with Evliya Çelebi's narration of Hezarfen flying the entire Bosporus, they state that the flight most likely was real, but heavily exaggerated, as Çelebi often exaggerates in his writings. He has great reputation in Turkey as an inspiration for future generations of aviators.
Non-powered flight.
The 17th century writings of Evliyâ Çelebi relate this story of Hezârfen Ahmed Çelebi, circa 1630–1632:
While modern historians disagree with Evliya Çelebi's narration of Hezarfen flying the entire Bosporus, they state that the flight most likely was real, but heavily exaggerated, as Çelebi often exaggerates in his writings.
The title "Hezârfen", given by Evliyâ Çelebi to Ahmet Çelebi, is from Persian هزار "hezār" + فنّ "fann" meaning "having a thousand sciences" (polymath).
Historic account.
In 1648, John Wilkins cites Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, the Holy Roman ambassador to Constantinople in 1554–1562, as recording that "a Turk in Constantinople" attempted to fly. However, if accurate, this citation refers to an event nearly a century prior to the exploits reported by Evliyâ Çelebi.
Evliyâ Çelebi's account of the exploits of Hezârfen Ahmet Çelebi is three sentences long (of a ten volume work). The story has great currency in Turkey as he is an inspiration for future generations of aviators.
