The Earl Marshal is a member of the Royal Household and is in charge of organising royal ceremonies and processions. The Earl Marshal is not a member of the College of Arms, but he must give his permission before the College of Arms can issue a coat of arms.
The Earl Marshal is always the Duke of Norfolk, and because he is Earl Marshal the Duke of Norfolk is a member of the House of Lords without being elected by the other hereditary peers.
