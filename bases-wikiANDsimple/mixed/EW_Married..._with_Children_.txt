Married... with Children is an American television sitcom created by Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt for the Fox Broadcasting Company. Originally broadcast from April 5, 1987, to June 9, 1997, it is the longest-lasting live-action sitcom on Fox and the first to be broadcast in the network's primetime slot. In addition to the show's original run, one episode that was not screened on Fox when originally filmed on January 6, 1989, was aired on FX on June 18, 2002, five years after the series' conclusion.
The show follows the suburban Chicago lives of Al Bundy, a once-glorious high school football player turned hard-luck women's shoe salesman; his lazy wife, Peggy; their beautiful, dumb and popular daughter, Kelly; and their smart, horny and unpopular son, Bud. Their neighbors are the upwardly mobile Steve Rhoades and his wife Marcy, who later gets remarried to Jefferson D'Arcy, a white-collar criminal who becomes her "trophy husband" and Al's sidekick. Most storylines involve Al's schemes being foiled by his own cartoonish dim wit and bad luck.
The series comprises 259 episodes and 11 seasons. Its theme song is "Love and Marriage"' by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen, performed by Frank Sinatra from the 1955 television production "Our Town".
The first two seasons of the series were videotaped at ABC Television Center in Hollywood. Seasons three to eight were taped at Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood; the final three seasons were taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City. The series was produced by Embassy Communications during its first season and half of its second season and the remaining seasons by ELP Communications under the studio Columbia Pictures Television.
In 2008, the show placed number 94 on "Entertainment Weekly" "New TV Classics" list.
Cast and characters.
Pilot episode.
In the show's pilot episode, Tina Caspary played the role of Kelly Bundy, while Hunter Carson played Bud. Before the series aired publicly the roles for the two Bundy children were re-cast. O'Neill felt a lack of chemistry with the original actors cast as the children. He requested a re-cast, which the producers approved. All of the scenes in the original pilot were re-shot with the replacement actors, Christina Applegate and David Faustino.
Fox broadcast history.
On April 22, 2012, Fox reaired the series premiere in commemoration of its 25th anniversary.
Episodes.
During its 11-season run on the Fox network, "Married... with Children" aired 258 episodes. A 259th episode, "I'll See You in Court" from season 3, never aired on Fox (see below), but premiered on FX and has since been included on DVD and in syndication packages. The episode counts in the chart below. Three specials also aired following the series' cancellation, including a cast reunion.
Nielsen ratings.
Despite the show's enduring popularity and fanbase, "Married... with Children" was never a huge ratings success. Part of the reason was the fact that Fox, being a new startup network, did not have the affiliate base of the Big Three television networks, thus preventing the series from reaching the entire country. In an interview for a special commemorating the series' 20-year anniversary in 2007, Katey Sagal stated that part of the problem the series faced was that many areas of the country were able to get Fox only through low-quality UHF channels well into the early 1990s, while some areas of the country did not receive the new network at all, a problem not largely rectified until the launch of Foxnet in June 1991 and later the network's acquisition of National Football League rights which led to several stations across the United States changing affiliations. For instance, Ed O'Neill's hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, didn't have its own Fox affiliate until CBS affiliate WKBN-TV signed on WFXI-CA/WYFX-LP in 1998 (the area was served by WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh and Cleveland's Fox affiliates--initially WOIO, then WJW--as default affiliates on cable), so many of O'Neill's friends and family mistakenly thought he was famous for beer commercials during this time.
Another problem lay in the fact that many of the newly developed series on Fox were unsuccessful, which kept the network from building a popular lineup to draw in a larger audience. In its original airing debut, "Married... with Children" was part of a Sunday lineup that competed with the popular "Murder, She Wrote" and Sunday-night movie on CBS. Fellow freshman series included "Duet", cancelled in 1989, along with "It's Garry Shandling's Show" and "The Tracey Ullman Show", both of which were canceled in 1990. The success of "The Simpsons", which debuted on "The Tracey Ullman Show" in 1987, helped draw some viewers over to Fox, allowing "Married... with Children" to sneak into the top 50 of television shows for seasons 3 through 9 doing its best overall rating at number 8 for its third and tenth seasons. Although these ratings were somewhat small in comparison with the other three networks, they were good enough for Fox to keep renewing the show.
While the series didn't end on a cliffhanger, it was expected to be renewed for a 12th season (which would have been the final season) and thus didn't have a proper series finale when Fox decided to cancel it in 1997. With Fox announcing the cancellation publicly before informing the cast and crew, most if not all of them found out about the series cancellation from fans and low-level employees instead of from the network itself. Katey Sagal stated that she constantly felt that the series was neglected by Fox despite helping bring the fledgling network on the map and was even on before "The Simpsons", which Ed O'Neill attributed to the constant turnover at the top of the Fox Network aside from owner Rupert Murdoch during the series run. In a 2013 interview, O'Neill stated that he felt TV stations who owned syndication rights to the series put pressure on Fox and Sony Pictures Television to end the series since the series had nearly three times the episodes needed for syndication and the production of more episodes would have resulted in higher rights fees.

Controversy.
In 1989, Terry Rakolta, from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, led a boycott of the show after viewing the episode "Her Cups Runneth Over". Offended by the images of an old man wearing a woman's garter and stockings, the scene where Steve touches the pasties of a mannequin dressed in S&amp;M gear, a homosexual man wearing a tiara on his head (and Al's line "...and they wonder why we call them 'queens'"), and a half-nude woman who takes off her bra in front of Al (and is shown with her arms covering her bare chest in the next shot), Rakolta began a letter-writing campaign to advertisers, demanding they boycott the show.
After advertisers began dropping their support for the show, and while Rakolta made several appearances on television talk shows demanding the show's cancellation, Fox executives refused to air the episode titled "I'll See You in Court." This episode became known as the "Lost Episode" and was aired on FX on June 18, 2002, with some parts cut. The episode was packaged with the rest of the third season in the January 2005 DVD release (and in the first volume of the "Married ... With Children Most Outrageous Episodes" DVD set) with the parts cut from syndication restored.
Ironically, viewers' curiosity over the boycott and over the show itself led to a drastic ratings boost in an example of the Streisand Effect, which Rakolta has since acknowledged. She has been referenced twice on the show: "Rock and Roll Girl" when a newscaster mentioned the city Bloomfield Hills, and "No Pot to Pease In", when a television show was made about the Bundy family and then was cancelled because (according to Marcy) "some woman in Michigan didn't like it."
The conservative Parents Television Council named "Married... with Children" the worst show of both the 1995–96 and 1996–97 television seasons in its first two years in operation. In 1996, the organization called the show the "crudest comedy on prime time television...peppered with lewd punch lines about sex, masturbation, the gay lifestyle and the lead character's fondness for pornographic magazines and strip clubs." Amanda Bearse told News Corp Australia in 2018 that she did not believe the show would work in the present day given its content amid a more politically correct climate. "It was a mean-spirited and misogynist show. It was just so completely inappropriate," said Bearse. "Even then it wasn't everybody's cup of tea but for some reason it's had this amazing longevity."
Despite the series controversial content and being clearly aimed at a male audience, it did receive recognition behind the scenes as being one of the few series on at the time that gave women prominent roles backstage and was often praised for its treatment of women. Producers rewrote the sixth season story of Peggy's pregnancy, which coincided with Sagal being an expectant mother, as a dream Al had after Sagal miscarried. This was done to prevent the actress from suffering further trauma by having to interact with an infant on the set. The positive treatment of women on the set also allowed Bearse to become one of the first mainstream actresses to publicly come out as lesbian, which she did during the series and received positive recognition for doing so.
Home media.
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released all 11 seasons of "Married... with Children" on DVD in Regions 1, 2, &amp; 4. On December 12, 2010, Sony released a complete series set on DVD in Region 1.
In December 2007, the Big Bundy Box—a special collection box with all seasons plus new interviews with Sagal and David Faustino—was released. This boxset was released in Australia (Region 4) on November 23, 2009.
The Sony DVD box sets from season 3 onward do not feature the original "Love and Marriage" theme song in the opening sequence. This was done because Sony was unable to obtain the licensing rights to the song for later sets. Despite this, the end credits on the DVDs for season 3 still include a credit for "Love and Marriage."
On August 27, 2013, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the home media rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including "Married... with Children" with the original theme song "Love and Marriage" sung by Frank Sinatra. They have subsequently re-released the 11 seasons on DVD. The Mill Creek Entertainment version (along with the versions available for streaming and downloading) include scenes that are normally edited in syndication and most of the licensed music that's dubbed over or deleted due to copyright issues. A complete series DVD set was re-released on July 7, 2015 in Region 1. All seasons of "Married... with Children" are now available for online download and streaming through Amazon, Apple iTunes, Hulu, and Vudu.

And their neighbors Irina and Alik continue to be friends with the family, which Azizyans do not quite approve. The only bright spot in the life of the family is their house, which Garnik inherited from his grandfather.
An Argentine remake was made by Telefe in 2005, called "Casados con Hijos". Two seasons were made (2005 and 2006), totaling 215 episodes and it became a mashing success during the replaying. More than fifteen years after the release, it is still aired on Saturdays at 7:30 pm. The series has been also shown by local channels in Uruguay, Paraguay, and Peru.
The character names are: José "Pepe" Argento (based on Al, played by Guillermo Francella), Mónica "Moni" Argento (based on Peggy, played by Florencia Peña), Paola Argento (based on Kelly, played by Luisana Lopilato), Alfio "Coqui" Argento (based on Bud, played by Darío Lopilato), Dardo and María Elena Fuseneco (based on Jefferson D'Arcy, Steve Rhoades and Marcy), played by Marcelo de Bellis and Érica Rivas).

In Germany, the 1992 remake "Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt", broadcast in the prime time, reached double the audience than the original (broadcast in the early fringe time). This, however, was not enough to maintain the series, so it was cancelled after one season. The remake used the exact translated scripts of the original series (which already substituted localised humour and in-jokes for incomprehensible references to American TV shows not shown in Germany, as well as some totally different jokes) and just renamed places and people according to the new setting.
" was aired from March to December 1993 for 26 episodes.
In 2006, Hungarian TV network TV2 purchased the license rights including scripts and hired the original producers from Sony Pictures for a remake of the show placed in a Hungarian environment. It was entitled " (in English: "Married with children in Budapest", loan translation: "A gruesomely decent family in Budapest"). The main story began with the new family called the Bándis inheriting an outskirt house from their American relatives the Bundys. They filmed a whole season of 26 episodes, all of them being remade versions of the plots of the original first seasons. It was the highest budget sitcom ever made in Hungary. First it was aired on Tuesday nights, but was beaten by a new season of "ER", then placed to Wednesday nights. The remake lost its viewers, but stayed on the air due to the contract between Sony and TV2. Also the Hungarian critics have strongly condemned the copyright infringement of the original series. They also criticized the lack of quality and the dilettante forcing of the American cliches in Eastern European (Hungarian) environment.
The complete American series aired in Israel in the 1990s, with reruns of it ever since. There has also been an Israeli remake to the show titled "Nesuim Plus" (Married Plus) that aired its two seasons from 2012 to 2017.
The Original "Married... With Children" ran on TV-6 Russia in the late 1990s and early 2000s (before the closing of the channel) in prime-time basis, broadcasting the episodes from seasons 1–10. The show later aired on DTV and Domashniy TV. However, for unknown reasons, most episodes from season 11 were not shown. A Russian adaptation, titled "Happy Together" (Schastlivy Vmeste; "Happy Together"), was broadcast on TNT across the country.

Spin-offs.
"Top of the Heap" was a sitcom starring Matt LeBlanc. The show was about Vinnie Verducci (played by LeBlanc) and his father Charlie (played by Joseph Bologna) always trying get rich quick schemes. The Verduccis were introduced in an earlier episode where Vinnie dated Kelly Bundy, and Charlie was introduced as an old friend of Al Bundy's. The end of the pilot episode shows Al breaking into their apartment and stealing their TV to replace the one he lost betting on Vinnie in a boxing match. However, the show didn't last long and was ultimately cancelled. It had its own spin-off/sequel called "Vinnie &amp; Bobby" a year later, which was also cancelled.
Also, an attempt was made to make a spin-off out of David Garrison's Steve Rhoades character which took place on Bud's Trumaine University called "Radio Free Trumaine" where Garrison played the Dean. "Enemies" was another spin-off, but played to be a spoof on the TV series "Friends". Meanwhile, a proposed series focusing on the NO MA'AM group without Al Bundy was outright rejected by Fox over fears of misogyny.
On September 11, 2014, it was announced that a spin-off was in the works, centered on the character of Bud Bundy.
U.S. syndication and international airings.
Distributed by Columbia Pictures Television Distribution, later Sony Pictures Television since 2002, "Married... with Children" debuted in off-network syndication in the fall of 1991. The series later began airing on cable on FX from September 1998 until 2007. In June 2002, FX became the first television network to air the controversial, previously banned episode "I'll See You in Court", albeit in an edited format. The fully uncensored version of "I'll See You in Court" can only be seen on the DVD release "Married... with Children: The Most Outrageous Episodes Volume 1" and the Mill Creek Entertainment complete series collection. The version found on the Third Season DVD set under Sony is the edited-for-TV version. In 2008, the Spike network reportedly paid US$12 million for broadcast rights to every episode including the unedited version of the infamous episode, "I'll See You in Court".
Syndication rights to the series are currently shared between NewsNation and ViacomCBS Domestic Media Networks. It previously aired on Antenna TV, Ion Television, TBS, and Sony's GetTV channel. WGN America gained rights to the show when TBS removed it from their early morning slots in September 2018. Following its acquisition by Nexstar Media Group and rebrand to NewsNation, the network indicated it would start rolling off its non-news programming as those contracts expire to expand news coverage. Meanwhile, eight ViacomCBS channels have carried the show since 2008: Spike (since renamed Paramount Network), TV Land, Comedy Central, Nick at Nite, MTV2, VH1 Classic (now MTV Classic), CMT, and Logo TV. In November 2018, the entire 11-season run became available to watch through Hulu.
"Married...with Children" has also been a ratings success in other countries around the world.
Locations.
The opening footage comprises views of Chicago, opening with a shot of Buckingham Fountain in Grant Park. The aerial downtown shot was taken from the Lake Shore Drive section north of the Loop. The expressway entrance shot was taken from the 1983 movie "National Lampoon's Vacation" featuring the Griswolds' green family truckster with a northeastward view of the Dan Ryan/Stevenson junction southwest of the Loop. The exterior shot used for the Bundys' house was taken in a subdivision in Deerfield, Illinois. Non-English versions might differ, e.g. the dubbed German version always includes the expressway shot.
