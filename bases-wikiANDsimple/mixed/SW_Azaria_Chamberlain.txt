Azaria Chamberlain is the name of a baby who went missing in 1980 near Ayers Rock in Australia. Her mother, Lindy Chamberlain, said that she was taken by a dingo and killed. Police said that Lindy Chamberlain had killed the baby and had lied. Lindy Chamberlain went to jail. In 1986, Lindy Chamberlain was taken out of jail, because they said that police had lied in court. A movie called "Evil Angels" was made about this story. This is one of Australia's greatest murder mysteries.
In 2005, a woman called Erin Horsburgh said that she was really Azaria Chamberlain and wanted police to do a DNA test to check. But police said that the woman was lying and they did not want to check. A DNA check would have made police open the case again to find out what really happened.
Some people think that a dingo cannot kill people, because a dingo is like a little dog. Some other people think that a dingo can kill people, and other times dingoes have hurt people. Many people make jokes about this, as they think that this is a lie. People in Australia say "A dingo stole my baby" as a joke, when they think someone is lying.
Some aborigines said that Azaria Chamberlain was taken by a dingo, but was not killed, and they looked after her for a while. Police would not talk to the aborigines in 1980. Erin Horsburgh says that is what happened. Many aborigines believe that Erin Horsburgh is Azaria Chamberlain.
Lindy Chamberlain was released from jail on Feb 7 1986, but not cleared until Sept 15 1988, at which time Lindy and Michael (her husband) were declared innocent of all charges. She and Michael were divorced on June 27 1991. She met Rick Creighton on a speaking tour of the United States in February 1992 and married him on December 20, 1992.
