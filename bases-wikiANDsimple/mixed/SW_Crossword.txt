A crossword is a popular type of word puzzle. A crossword is made up of black and white squares (called a 'grid') and a list of clues.
The answer to each clue is a word. The aim is to write the words letter-by-letter in the white squares. The white squares go "across" or "down" the page. Each clue has a number - for example "1 Across" or "15 Down".
There are many types of crossword puzzle. Straight (or Quick) crosswords are usually made up of simple definitions - which means that other words are used to describe the answer. Some crosswords use riddles and word play and are usually more difficult than straight crosswords.
