Eoraptor (meaning "dawn thief") is one of the earliest known dinosaurs. It was a very small carnivore (meat-eater) that lived during the late Triassic period, about 228 million years ago.
Eoraptor was a small, lightly-built dinosaur that walked on two long legs. It was about 3 feet long (1 m); it had light, hollow bones, a long head with dozens of small, sharp teeth, and five fingers on its grasping hands (two of the fingers on each hand were very small).
