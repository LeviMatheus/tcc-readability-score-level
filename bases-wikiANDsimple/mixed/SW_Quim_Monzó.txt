Quim Monzó was born in Barcelona, Spain, in 1952. He is a Catalan writer of novels, short stories and discursive prose, mostly in the Catalan language.
In the early 1970s, Monzó reported from Vietnam, Cambodia, Northern Ireland and East Africa for newspapers in Barcelona. His fiction is full of irony. His other prose maintains this humor. One collection of his essays, "Catorze ciutats comptant-hi Brooklyn", is notable for its account of New York in the days immediately following September 11.
