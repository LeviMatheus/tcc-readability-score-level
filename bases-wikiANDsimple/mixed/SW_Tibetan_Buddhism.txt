Tibetan Buddhism is the body of religious Buddhist teachings from Tibet. The form of Buddhism taught in Tibet is mostly of the type called Vajrayana. However, Tibetan Buddhism also has teachings from the earlier forms of Buddhism called Theravada and Mahayana.
Buddhism first came from India into Tibet in 173 CE during the reign of Lha Thothori Nyantsen. However, Buddhism did not grow strong until much later.
In the 8th century, an Indian teacher called Padmasambhava brought Buddhism to Tibet again while Trisong Detsen was king of Tibet. Padmasambhava (more commonly known as "Guru Rinpoche") merged Buddhism with the local BÃ¶n religion to create Tibetan Buddhism. He also wrote a number of important texts.
Padmasambhava started the Nyingma school. All other schools of Tibetan Buddhism come from this school, which is also known as the "ancient school".
Tibetan Buddhism had a strong effect on the peoples of Central Asia in the 11th century CE, especially in Mongolia and Manchuria. It was made the official state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty and the Manchu Qing dynasty that ruled China.
Since the annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China in 1959, Tibetan Buddhism has spread to many Western countries.
In the past, Tibetan Buddhism was also called "Lamaism" by some people. This is now thought to be based on a misunderstanding of the practice of guru yoga ('guru' is the Sanskrit equivalent of the Tibetan word 'lama' which means 'spiritual teacher') in Tibetan.
