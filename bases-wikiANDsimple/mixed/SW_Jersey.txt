Jersey is an island that is located off the northwest coast of France. It is a crown dependency of the British monarchy. The territory of Jersey is called a "bailiwick" because the person who is head of the island is called the "Bailiff". The Bailiwick of Jersey also includes the islands of Minquiers and Ecréhous, where nobody lives. The other islands of the Channel Islands belong to the Bailiwick of Guernsey.
Over eighty-eight thousand people live on the main island. Thirty per cent of them live in its only town, Saint Helier.
Along with English and French, more than two thousand people speak Jèrriais, a dialectal form of the Norman language.
Politics.
The Bailiwick of Jersey is not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union. It has its own parliament called the "States of Jersey" which passes laws for the island.
"Jersey" is divided into 12 parishes which elect their own administration.
