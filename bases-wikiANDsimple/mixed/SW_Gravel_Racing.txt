Gravel Racing or Off-Road Street Racing is a new form of illegal Street Racing. Gravel Racing differs from Streeting Racing because "Gravel Racing" is more safe then "street racing" and Gravel Racing is legal. Gravel Racing involves street racing cars with off-road tires instead of street car wheels. Gravel Racing was first seen in the United States in the early 1990's and is more popular in the United States then anywhere else.
