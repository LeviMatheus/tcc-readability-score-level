The Elizabethan Religious Settlement was Elizabeth I’s answer to the religious quarrels that developed during the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI and Mary I.
This answer was given in two Acts of the Parliament of England. The Act of Supremacy of 1559 confirmed the English church’s independence from Rome. The Act of Uniformity 1559 decided about the form of the English church.
Often it was seen as the end of the English Reformation and the foundation of Anglicanism. But some historians think that England did not become a Protestant nation on a popular level for a long time since then. There seem to have been great divisions in the population and among the clergy for a long time afterwards.
