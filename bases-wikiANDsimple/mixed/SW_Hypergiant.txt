Hypergiants are the largest stars in the Universe, even larger than supergiants. The exact definition is unclear, although the hypergiant with the largest known diameter is VY Canis Majoris, which is between 1800 to 2100 more times wider than the Sun, or roughly the same as width of the orbit of Saturn.
Hypergiants are very rare and they have a short lifespan. While the Sun has a lifespan of around 10 billion yeas, hypergiants will only exist for a few million years.
