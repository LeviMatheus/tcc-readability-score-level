Ilocos collectively refers to two Provinces in the Philippines: Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur. Inhabitants are called "Ilocanos" and they speak the language Iloko, also called "Ilocano".
The term Ilocos Region is derived from this term. However, the designation of Ilocos as the basis of the name of the region promotes the wrong notion that all the residents of Region 1 are Ilocanos. Because 28% of the inhabitants are Pangasinan people, who belong to a different ethno-linguistic group from the Ilocanos.
