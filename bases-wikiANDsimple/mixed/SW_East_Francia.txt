Eastern Francia ("Regnum Francorum orientalium") was the land of Louis the German after the Treaty of Verdun of 843. That treaty divided Carolingian Empire of the Franks into an East, West, and Middle. Over the centuries it changed into the Holy Roman Empire and modern Germany.Until the beginning of the 12. century it was known as Francia Orientalis or the Kingdom of the East Franks'". If the beginning of the Holy Roman Empire is thought to have happened at the same time as the rise of the Ottonian dynasty, the kingdom of East Francia lasted from 843 to when Duke Henry I of Saxony became a monarch on in 919; or it could have began in 962, when Otto the Great became a monarch ("translatio imperii").
East Francia was divided into four duchies: Swabia (Alamannia), Franconia, Saxony and Bavaria (with Carinthia). And after the death of Lothair II in 869, these were added the eastern parts of Lotharingia.
This division have there until 1268, the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty.
From the 10th century, East Francia was also known as "Regnum Teutonicum" ("Teutonic kingdom", "Kingdom of Germany"), a term in Salian times.
