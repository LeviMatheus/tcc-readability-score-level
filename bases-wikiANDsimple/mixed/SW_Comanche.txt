Comanche peoples are Native Americans who lived in an area called the "Comancheria", which was where Eastern New Mexico, Southern Colorado, Southern Kansas, all of Oklahoma and most of Northern and Southern Texas are today. There once were as many as 20,000 Comanches. Today, the Comanche Nation has 10,000 members, about all of them live in Oklahoma (centered at Lawton), and the rest in Texas, California, and New Mexico. The Comanche speak a language of their own, the Comanche language that is related to other Native American ones, called "Uto-Aztecan language family".
The name Comanche was given by the Mexicans, and it was the word the Comanche used to call them, "komantsia" (enemy, foreigner). But the Comanches' call themselves "Numunuu", meaning "human being" or "the People". They were very good warriors and fought the White settlers and Army for many years until they gave up in 1875.
