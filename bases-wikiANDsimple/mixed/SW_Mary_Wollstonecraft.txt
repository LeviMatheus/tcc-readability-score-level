Mary Wollstonecraft (April 27, 1759 â€“ September 10, 1797) was an English philosopher and early feminist. She also wrote children's books. Her two most famous books were "A Vindication of the Rights of Men" (1790), a response to the French Revolution, and "A Vindication of the Rights of Women" (1792) which argued that women should have the same rights as men did.
Wollstonecraft was married to the philosopher William Godwin, and was the mother of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin (Mary Shelley), the author of "Frankenstein".
