Curitiba was founded in 1693 as a small village. It has since become an important trading stop because a road was opened, connecting the southeast region to Southern Brazil. In 1853, it became the capital of the newly created province of Paraná. Since then, the city has seen a large urban growth. During the 19th century, many European immigrants arrived. Most of them were Germans, Poles, Ukrainians and Italians. They added to the cultural diversity that still exists there. The city made several plans and laws that were set up to slow the growth of the city and that led the city to be famous for its new ideas and connection to the environment. Most of the new ideas were in the public transport system. Today, the city has a sense of cosmopolitan life and is considered the safest city in Brazil. It is the Brazilian capital with the best quality of living and is a diversified industrial center that gives Curitiba the rank of 4th largest economy in Brazil - the largest in the southern region. The city is considered one of the 5 best cities to invest in in Latin America
Large companies have moved their headquarters to the city because of Curitiba's structure, the main international airport of the southern region (the Afonso Pena International Airport), its proximity to the Port of Paranaguá and the junction of highways and railroads linking the south region directly to the southeast of the country. Many multinational automotive (car) companies are located in Greater Curitiba, which makes Curitiba the second largest automotive center in the country. Curitiba is an important cultural, political and economic center in the country.
Curitiba has high rates of education and is home to the oldest Brazilian university, the Federal University of Paraná. People from Curitiba are called "curitibanos" in Portuguese language, and "Curitibans" in English language.
Etymology.
The name "Curitiba" comes from the large number of Brazilian "Pines" - or commonly called as "Parana Pine" too - ("Araucaria angustifolia") in the region prior to its foundation. There are two acceptable versions for the name's origin: the indians of the Tupi nation, namely the Jê and the Guarani, employed the word "corae" ("pine seed") "atuba" ("a lot"). The other version, also from the Tupi language, comes from the combination of "kurit" ("pine tree") and "yba" ("large amount"). So, "Curitiba" means something as "Land of Abundant Pines".
Panorama.
Curitiba is known for the urban differentiated solutions, notably for the integrated system of transport of people, together with the regular transit routes, has served, especially from the 1970s, as inducer of the urban development.
The public transport system in Curitiba is usually remembered for passenger terminals connected by channels exclusive to bus "Vermelhos" ("Red Buses"), the "Expressos" ("Express Buses"), "Articulados" ("Articulated buses") and "Biarticulados" ("Biarticulated buses") - the biarticulated bus circulates along the longer itineraries, stopping only on the tube-station stops for timely entering/exiting maneuvers; each biarticulated bus can carry 270 passengers - and complemented with the speedy silver "Ligeirinho" (literally, "speedy"), with an modern design, has fewer stops, therefore shortening distances – when compared to the "Linha Direta" ("Direct Line") – due to saved time, and feeders differentiated by color.
This model has inspired similar experiments in cities of other countries, such as Los Angeles and New York City, where, in the 1990s, the installation of an experimental line of "ligeirinho" in the city, connecting the city to the World Trade Center. The system is the source of inspiration for the TransMilenio in Bogotá, Colombia, Metrovia in Guayaquil, Ecuador,as well as the Orange Line of Los Angeles, California, and for a future transportation system in Panama City, Panama.
Around the city and commonly integrated with the terminals of buses, are the "Ruas da Cidadania" ("Streets of Citizenship"), municipal centers bringing together municipal departments and public agencies, state and federal, points of trade, services, free Internet access and equipment, leisure, as playgrounds, and space of all kind sports.
Recent measurements indicate that the green area of Curitiba is of 51.5 metres per capita - about three times the minimum area recommended by the UN - one of the highest in Brazil and higher than cities like London or Paris. These areas are composed primarily by municipal parks and forests to protect the forests gallery of local rivers. There are also in a variety of city squares and public grounds, usually associated with public roads and wooded.
The urban zoning of the city, the integrated transport system, has allowed a development architectural and urban taken by some analysts as cohesive and harmony without the main problems of large modern cities. Curitiba, including, recently recommended by UNESCO as one of the city-model for the reconstruction of the cities of Afghanistan, after the military intervention occurred in that country in 2001.

Since was created, the UNILIVRE is a reference about studies in economically sustainable preservation of ecosystems, serving as a model for other similar institutions in various parts of the world, as in Cordoba (Argentina), Río Grande (Patagonia), Seoul (Korea) and Guadalajara (Mexico), and in many other Brazilian cities.
The capital of the state of Paraná was the only Brazilian city to enter the 21st century as a reference for national and international urban planning and quality of life; a search by the American magazine Reader's Digest, it was the Brazilian municipality better placed in the ranking of the best cities in the world to live. In March 2001, a poll sponsored by the UN pointed Curitiba as the best capital of Brazil by the Index of Living Conditions (ILC) and second best among the HDI of brazilian capitals. The city is the gateway to entering the Mercosur (the southern zone common market of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay).

According study of the "América Economia" magazine, published in the "Special Edition Cities 2006", which has the title "The City Innovative", Curitiba is ahead of important capitals as Mexico City, Buenos Aires and Brasilia, occupying the fifth placing. The magazine considered the main Latin American economies or those that have relevance to the business conducted on the continent. In the front of the Paraná state capital are just São Paulo, Brazil, first in the ranking; Santiago, Chile; Monterrey, Mexico; and Miami, USA.
The city was the first in Brazil to introduce the separation of domestic garbage on a wide-scale basis. The acclaimed program "Lixo que não é Lixo" (literally, "Garbage that isn’t Garbage"; a successful recycling program) created in 1989 has become a paradigm of care for the environment.

History.
Curitiba used to be a forest once populated by the indigenous tribe Tingüi. During the 16th century, Europeans began to go to war with this tribe.
Localization.
Curitiba is located on the first plateau of Paraná, in the most flat area, also called plateau curitibano. Occupy an geographical area of 432.17 km², in the latitude 25º25'40"S and longitude 49º16'23"W. The coastline of the state is a distance of 70 km from the city (Atlantic Ocean). The capital has a north-south length of 35km, and 20 km east-west.
Relief.
The city has surface of 432.17 km² in the First Plateau of Paraná. The relief of Curitiba is just a little wavy. The average altitude of the city is 934.6m above sea level, ranging between minimum and maximum values of 900 and 1,000 meters, approximately.
Curitiba has a wavy topography of smooth rounded hills, an terrain a little wavy, giving a relatively regular physiognomy.
The municipality of Curitiba has an average altitude of 934.6 m above sea level, where the highest point is to the north (1.021,00m). To the south is the situation of lower altitude (864,9m).
There are mountain ranges and sets of rocky elevations in practically all around the city, being the most remarkable and impressive of the "Serra do Mar" (portuguese for "Mountain Range of the Sea"), located in the east that separates the plateau from the coast of Paraná.
Climate.
Curitiba's climate is commonly calm all year round though locals complain that the weather can be anything at anytime. Heat waves happen during winter and cold waves happen during summer are not uncommon. Even within one day there can be great differences, usually subtropical climate.
The flat terrain, lakes and marshland help its mild damp winters, where the average temperature of 13°C (57°F) in the coldest month falls a bit below 0°C (32°F) on the coldest days. During summer, the average temperature is around 21°C (70°F), but sometimes gets around 32°C (90°F) on hot days – sometiems in the upper 30s °C.
Anyway, located in Southern Brazil, Curitiba is a somewhat humid city in Subtropical zone and, of Brazil's twenty-six state capitals, Curitiba is the coldest because of altitude (the city is on a plateau 932 m above sea level). The city is in the Subtropical region, within the Atlantic Rainforest region that goes along the eastern side of Brazil, and is sited on a plateau 932 m (3107 ft) above sea level with the higher peaks of a mountain range creating a barrier that separate it from the Atlantic Ocean just 105 km (65 miles) away. The average temperature during the summers is 21°C, and during the winter, 13°C.
Hydrography and Pluviometry.
The catchment area of Curitiba consists of several rivers and streams that cross the city in different directions, grouped in six river basins. The main rivers that form the watershed of the city are: Atuba River, Belém River, Barigüi River, Passaúna River, Ribeirão dos Padilhas and the Iguaçu River, all with characteristics of dendritic drainage. Since the 1970s, Curitiba has working on alternatives to minimize the negative impacts of urbanization on rivers. An example of this was the construction of parks along the rivers with artificial lakes, which retain the water for longer periods of time, minimizing floods. Currently, after many studies about the local water passages, almost all the rivers are in canalization process. Other alternatives developed to minimize the effects of urbanization are the implementation of the programs for environmental education, inspection and monitoring, elaboration and application of legislation and infrastructure works.
The index reaches 1,500 mm rainfall on average per year, because the rains are constant in the climate of the city. It happens, among other reasons, because of the large deforestation of the Mountain Range of the Sea ("Serra do Mar"), natural barrier to moisture.
Vegetation.
Curitiba is located in the area of vegetation called Araucaria moist forests, composed of steppes, Araucaria forest and other formations.
In the local vegetation still appear remnants of the parana pine ("Araucaria angustifolia"), which resisted the action of modern civilization. The parana pines are in private and public areas, now protected by environmental legislation which prevents it from being overturned. The Municipal Secretariat of the Environment maintains a botanical garden and three green houses for the annual production of 150,000 seedlings of native and exotic tree species, 16,000 seedlings of fruit trees, 260,000 seedlings of flowers, foliage and underbrush, on top of the total maintenance of 350,000 seedlings. The green area of the city is one of largest in Brazil.
The vegetation of Curitiba is also characterized by the existence of a large quantity of purple and yellow "ipês" (tabebuias), making a spectacle of beauty to the landscape of the city during the flowering in the end of winter. Currently, the yellow ipê is the most common tree in the city.
Neighborhoods.

Like other major Brazilian cities, Curitiba has seen the emergence of slums in some neighborhoods and around the city, and the growth of street inhabitants, that many times had been sent of other cities and States, and are dropped in the streets of the city. This fact has made a small growth of crime level, but is not comparable to other major Brazilian cities.
Moreover, many rivers contains levels of pollution; the landfill (deposit of garbage) is almost full; the public transport sometimes is not enough for the quantity of people (in the rush hour), and the Brazilian government does not yield funds for the construction of a subway in the city.
Architecture.

Also, buildings that are integrate with nature is a tendency to 21st century and reflect an important style of Curitiba, as can see in some famous places of the city.
Because it is a planned city, the administration uses a rigid plan for growth, aiming to facilitate the use of public transport. The idea was to organize the city along transport corridors. The buildings are close to major bus lines. The rule is simple: buildings with more than eight floors can only be built in the first block, near the corridor. Buildings with less than eight floors, in the second block, and in other, smaller buildings and houses. This encourages the system bus, that is widely used, reducing the number of cars.
