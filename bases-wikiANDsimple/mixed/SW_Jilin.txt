Jilin is one of 3 provinces in the far northeastern part of China. It is bordered on the north by Heilongjiang province, to the west by the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" (_____), and to the southwest by Liaoning province. To the east lies North Korea.
The capital city of Jilin is Changchun (meaning "long spring").
The terrain and climate are much like that of neighboring Heilongjiang province. Also like its neighboring provinces, one of the main agricultural products is corn, as the climate is too cold (and dry) for satisfactory rice cultivation.
