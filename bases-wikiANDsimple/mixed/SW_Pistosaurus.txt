Pistosaurus longaevus is a genus of acuatic sauropterygian reptile belonging to the plesiosaur order.
"Pistosaurus" was a advanced nothosaur-like body with a plesiosaur-like head. Is presently known only from the Middle Triassic. Even if it is a nothosaur it is acknowledged to be closely related to the ancestors of plesiosaurs.
