Early life.
MacLachlan was born Kyle Merritt McLachlan (subsequently changing the spelling of his name to reflect his Scottish heritage), at Yakima Valley Memorial Hospital in Yakima, Washington. His mother, Catherine ("née" Stone; 1934-1986), was a public relations director for a school district and a homemaker who was active in community arts programs. His father, Kent Alan McLachlan (1933-2011), was a stockbroker and lawyer. Kyle has Scottish, Cornish, and German ancestry. He grew up in Yakima, the eldest of three boys. His two younger brothers, Craig and Kent Jr., live in the Seattle area. MacLachlan graduated from Eisenhower High School in Yakima. His mother left his father when he was 17, and his parents divorced in his senior year of high school on 12 October 1977. His mother later remarried to Lonny Smart on 18 December 1977.
MacLachlan was introduced to stage acting by his mother when she became director of a youth theater program for teenagers that she helped set up in Yakima. She also sent him to piano lessons from the age of 9 to 14, when he also began to study classical singing. While in high school, he performed in plays and in class musicals, acting in his first play aged 15. For his senior year, MacLachlan played the lead role of Brindsley Miller in a production of Peter Shaffer's one-act play "Black Comedy" and also performed as Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady". In 1982, he graduated cum laude with a BFA in drama from the University of Washington (UW), as a student of the Professional Actor Training Program. He initially planned to major in business and also studied classical voice at UW, but changed his focus to acting.
Career.
1980s.
The first film MacLachlan worked on was "The Changeling" (1980), part of which was shot on the University of Washington campus. He was paid $10 as an extra.
In the summer of 1981, after his sophomore year at college, he played the lead in three roles at the Old Lyric Repertory Theatre in Logan, Utah and the following summer with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, Oregon.
MacLachlan made his film debut in "Dune" (1984) in the starring role of Paul Atreides. While still in college, MacLachlan was appearing in Molière's "Tartuffe" in a Seattle-area theater. A casting agent for "Dune" producer Dino de Laurentiis was looking for a young actor to star in the film, and multiple people recommended MacLachlan. After several screen tests, he hit it off with director David Lynch, aided by their common Pacific Northwest backgrounds, and succeeded in winning the part.
After "Dune" flopped and met with poor reviews from critics, MacLachlan found it difficult to find work. He moved to Los Angeles in 1985, and auditioned for several films, including "Top Gun", but failed to win any roles, eventually dropping his agent, Creative Artists Agency.
Finally, Lynch cast MacLachlan in the starring role of Jeffrey Beaumont in "Blue Velvet" (1986), which was received more positively. He starred in the 1987 Science Fiction Action film "The Hidden" as FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher.
1990s.
MacLachlan further collaborated with Lynch in the ABC television series "Twin Peaks" (1990–91), playing Special Agent Dale Cooper, reprising that role for Lynch's 1992 prequel film "". Lynch commented on those roles in a "GQ" story about MacLachlan: "Kyle plays innocents who are interested in the mysteries of life. He's the person you trust enough to go into a strange world with." MacLachlan also said he considered Lynch one of his mentors that had a "monumental impact" on him. 
MacLachlan appeared as musician Ray Manzarek in Oliver Stone's 1991 film "The Doors", about the band of the same name. He had previously turned down Stone's offer to play Chris in the 1986 movie "Platoon", which ultimately went to Charlie Sheen.

In 1995, MacLachlan starred in Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls". The movie was heavily panned by critics and it collected a record seven Golden Raspberry Awards. MacLachlan recalls that when he watched "Showgirls" for the first time before the premiere, he thought it was "horrible". But he later realised that the movie was "inadvertently funny" and embraced for its campiness. According to MacLachlan, although he skipped the movie's press tour, he had sat through the whole screening, contrary to reports that he walked out.
In the 1990s, MacLachlan was offered by NBC to be one of the lead actors on the then-new soap opera "Passions" as a powerful, wealthy villain and head of a multimillion-dollar company, but MacLachlan turned it down.
