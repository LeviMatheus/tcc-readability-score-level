Yarra Trams is a tram operating company in Melbourne, Australia. Its partner is a French company called Transdev and an Australian company Transfield Services.
Yarra Trams was started in October 1997.
Background.
After the collapse of M>Train and M>Tram in December 2002, the State Government wanted to start one main metropolitan train operator and one tram operator. On 18 April 2004, Yarra Trams took hold of the whole Melbourne tram network. The Melbourne tram network spans some 245 km and has over 1,700 tram stops. It is the third biggest tram network in the world.
The current CEO of Yarra Trams is Dennis Cliche. He was promoted in September 2005 after the resignation of Hubert Guyot.
Yarra Trams currently employs around 1,200 tram drivers and 250 customer service staff. Services operate for nearly 20 hours per day. A total of 141 million trips were taken in 2002 and 2003, rising to nearly 150 million in 2004.
Fleet.
The Yarra Trams fleet consists of 500 trams, operated from eight stations located around the system. The bulk of the fleet is made up of Z, A and B Class trams, which were built by Comeng between 1975 and 1994.
In October 2001, Yarra Trams took delivery of 36 Citadis trams which have primarily operated on route 109 to complement the extension to Box Hill.
As part of the creation of one tram company in 2004, Yarra acquired 39 Combino trams and oversaw the delivery of another 20 Combino trams originally ordered by National Express.
Apollo Seating.
In 2003, Yarra Trams tried out a seating layout which became known as "Apollo". The trial was to remove 30 seats from a B Class tram and replace the removed seats with "bum racks" which are found in Citadis trams. This resulted in a higher capacity for standing passengers on crowded services during peak hours.
A further ten trams received the seating layout during refurbishment. All bar 1 tram are located at Brunswick Depot.
Ticketing.
Yarra Trams currently runs under the Metlink banner and utilises the Metcard ticketing system. Each tram has a coin only ticket machine on board. The on board machines currently sell City Saver, 2 Hour and Daily tickets. Trams are also equipped with a number of ticket validators.
Major superstops in the CBD also have coin-only ticket machines. Tickets can also be purchased from Railway Stations and retail outlets displaying a blue Metcard flag.
Most tram routes operate entirely within Zone 1, however Routes 75, 86 and 109 enter Zone 2.
Think Tram.
Yarra Trams is a partner in the Think Tram program, aimed at improving tram travel time and reliability.
Trivia.
"Yarra Trams" backwards is "Smart Array", the name of a line of HP RAID controllers.
