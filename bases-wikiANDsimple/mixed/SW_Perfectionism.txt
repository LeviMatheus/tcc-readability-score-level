Perfectionism is the belief that one can and should be perfect. A person who believes this is called a "perfectionist". Perfectionists believe that anything less than perfect is unacceptable. While this can lead people to achieve great accomplishments and give people motivation, it is considered to be a mostly unhealthy belief. Perfectionism can lead to procrastination ("I can't do this project until I can do it the "right" way."). This can mean low productivity. Perfectionism may also cause low self-esteem and anxiety.
