In biology, a solution is called hypotonic if there are less solutes in it compared to the solution inside a cell.
When a cell is exposed to a hypotonic solution, it will gain water over time. This way, the water diffuses into the cell and causes the cell to swell.
Plants live in hypotonic environments. However, their cells do not swell; this is because their cells are covered with cell walls that prevent them from bursting.
