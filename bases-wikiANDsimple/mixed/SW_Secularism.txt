Secularism, also called Secularity or sometimes Laicity (adjectives: Secular or non religious) is the idea of something being not religious or not connected to a church. An example in government is, since many countries made it a law to be a part of one religion, the First Amendment was put in the United States Constitution by "founding fathers" like Thomas Jefferson to make sure that religion and government stayed separate ("Separation of Church and State"). This means that anyone can choose to practice or not practice any religion they want, and the government cannot make them be a part of a religion if they do not want to.
