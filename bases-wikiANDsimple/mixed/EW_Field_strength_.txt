In physics, field strength means the "magnitude" of a vector-valued field (e.g., in volts per meter, V/m, for an electric field E). 
For example, an electromagnetic field results in both electric field strength and magnetic field strength.
As an application, in radio frequency telecommunications, the signal strength excites a receiving antenna and thereby induces a voltage at a specific frequency and polarization in order to provide an input signal to a radio receiver. Field strength meters are used for such applications as cellular, broadcasting, wi-fi and a wide variety of other radio-related applications.
