Palpatine (also known as the Emperor and Darth Sidious) is a character from the "Star Wars" universe.
His most famous and once only seen force ability is force lightning seen in the last episode "Return of the Jedi" which is forked to spread the damage even further and is blueish purple. He is played by Ian McDiarmid. He is seen in Episode V for the first time. Palpatine is believed to be the true villain of the Star Wars films because he was the one who caused Anakin Skywalker to join the Dark Side of the Force.
Palpatine rose to power in Episode III, when he sent Anakin to the Jedi Temple and ordered the Clone Troopers to execute Order 66. Palpatine battled Yoda in a duel which would decide the fate of the Galaxy. He defeated Yoda, and was able to form a new order upon the fallen Republic; he created the first Galactic Empire.
Palpatine ruled the Galaxy for 23 years, when in the end he was killed by his own apprentice, Darth Vader.
