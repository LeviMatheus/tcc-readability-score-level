Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, are a means to style HTML and XHTML web pages, like you are seeing now. CSS was designed by the W3C, and is supported well by most modern web browsers.
One advantage to using CSS is a web page can still be displayed and understood, even if the CSS is not working or removed.
