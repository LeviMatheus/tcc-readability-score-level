In mathematics division is an operation which is the opposite of multiplication.
In the above expression, "a" is called the dividend, "b" the divisor and "c" the quotient.
Division by zero (i.e. where the divisor is zero) is not defined.
Notation.
Division is most often shown by placing the "dividend" over the "divisor" with a horizontal line, also called a vinculum, between them. For example, "a" divided by "b" is written
This is the usual way to specify division in most computer programming languages since it can easily be typed as a simple sequence of characters.
Any of these forms can be used to display a fraction. A fraction is a division expression where both dividend and divisor are integers (although typically called the "numerator" and "denominator"). A fraction is an accepted way of writing numbers. It is not always expected that the result of the division is written in decimals.
But in elementary arithmetic this form is used rather often. The obelus is also used alone to represent the division operation itself, as for instance as a label on a key of a calculator.
In some non-English-speaking cultures, "a divided by b" is written "a": "b". However, in English usage the colon is restricted to expressing the related concept of ratios (then "a is to b").
