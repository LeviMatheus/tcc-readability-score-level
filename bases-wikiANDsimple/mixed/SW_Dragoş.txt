Dragoş ("Drágfi of Béltek") was a Maramureş Voivode ruling over the lands of what was to become Moldavia (between 1351 and 1353). He left Maramureş by orders from the Hungarian King Louis I, in order to establish a defense line against the Golden Horde. He was succeeded by his son, Sas ("Szász" or "Sas of Béltek") (ruled 1354-1358).
