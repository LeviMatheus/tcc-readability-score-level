Admontite is a mineral that is colorless in color and is made of crystals. It is named for Admont, Austria, which is where they found the first example of it. They found the first example of it in a gypsum deposit. Gypsum and calcite both easily scratch this mineral, and it easily breaks as well. Admontite is not radioactive.
