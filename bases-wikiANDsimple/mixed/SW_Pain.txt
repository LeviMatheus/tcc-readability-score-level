Pain is a symptom of being hurt or sick. It is a bad sensation that is physical "and" emotional.
Most pain starts when part of the body is hurt. Nerves in that part send messages to the brain. Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged. Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain. It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage.
The message that the nerve sends to the brain is called "nociception". What is experienced "because of" the nociception is pain.
Kinds of pain.
Pain can be "acute" or "chronic". Acute means it only happens a short time. Chronic means the pain lasts a long time.
Pain can also happen when there is no underlying injury or cause. Pain can happen just because the nerves do not work right. This is called "neuropathic" pain.
Treatments for pain.
For most pain, the best treatment is to stop the damage that makes the pain. If the ankle is sprained, doctors tells the person not to walk on it. They tell them to put ice on it. This helps the injury stop. For an ulcer in the stomach, doctors stop the acid made in the stomach. This helps the ulcer to heal.
There are doctors who specialize in pain management. These are usually anesthesiologists but may also have any one of a number of underlying areas of specialization, such as neurology, physiatry, or internal medicine.
