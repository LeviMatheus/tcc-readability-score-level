The British Rail Class 10 diesel locomotive was a variation on the Class 08 diesel-electric shunter. A Blackstone diesel engine was fitted instead of one made by the English Electric company. Traction motors were by either the General Electric Company plc (GEC) or British Thomson-Houston (BTH).
The locomotives were built at the BR Works in Darlington and Doncaster over the period 1953-62. Early batches were classified 4 (those with GEC motors) and 5 (those with BTH motors).
