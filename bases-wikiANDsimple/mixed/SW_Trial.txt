A trial is where 2 groups of people argue in a court.
In a civil trial, there is a plaintiff and a defendant. The plaintiff tries to prove that the defendant should give him money.
In a criminal trial, there's a prosecutor and a defendant. The prosecutor works for the government and tries to prove that the defendant committed a crime. If the crime is serious, the defendant may go to prison or, in some countries, be executed. For smaller crimes, there is often just a fine - money must be paid.
