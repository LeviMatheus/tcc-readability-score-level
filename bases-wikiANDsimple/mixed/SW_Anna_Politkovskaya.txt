Anna Stepanovna Politkovskaya ("Анна Степановна Политковская"; 30 August 1958 — 7 October 2006) was a Russian journalist. Journalists write texts for newspapers. Anna Politkovskaya wrote for the newspaper "Novaya Gazeta". She was born in the New York. Her parents were diplomants. Her origin (virgin) name was Anna Stepanovna Mazepa ("Анна Степановна Мазепа").
Journalism.
She was best-known for her thoughts about the war in Chechnya, a Russian state. She was also against the current leader of Russia, president Vladimir Putin. Many of her texts asked for human rights.
Death.
On October 7, 2006, she was murdered at the house where she lived. Many people think this murder has political reasons. Many western regimes have pressed for a thorough investigation of the circumstances of her death. They see it as another attempt to stifle opposition to the current Russian regime, as perhaps one of the last chances to save the freedom of the press in Russia. The "Noyava Gazeta" has put up a reward for information that can explain why she was killed.
