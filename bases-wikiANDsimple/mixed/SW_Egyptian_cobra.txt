The Egyptian cobra "(naja haje)" is a type of poisonous cobra. It was worshiped by the Ancient Egyptians. It lives in both North Africa and Southwestern Asia. It is one of the most venomous snakes in the world. Egyptian Cobras can grow up to 5'-6'8" (1.5-2m) and have been seen as large as 8' in some areas. Recently, a man was sentenced to a year in jail and a fine of $17,000 for owning an Egyptian cobra. Small symbols of Egyptian cobras were included in the crown of the pharaohs.
