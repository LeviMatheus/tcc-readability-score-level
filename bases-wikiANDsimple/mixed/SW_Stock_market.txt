A stock market is the market that people use to trade shares, which are like small pieces of the company that a person can own. The value of the share depends on how many people want to buy it and how many people are selling it.
People usually trade shares in stocks through a broker, who is a person that has studied the stock market and can help them make good choices in stocks. From that broker people can buy and sell stocks and shares by giving them all the information about corporations and its situation in the market as a whole.
