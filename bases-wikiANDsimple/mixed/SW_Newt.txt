Newts are small animals, a kind of salamander. Newts live in warm countries and in water most of the time. They are found in North America, Europe, and North Asia.
Their mother lays eggs and leaves them. Newts are born from those eggs. When they are young, they leave the water for a year. They go back in the water to have babies (larvae). They then stay in water for the rest of their lives. Newts have a lot of poison, and have bright colors as a warning to other animals.
