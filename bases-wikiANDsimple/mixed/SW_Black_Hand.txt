Black Hand or Crna Ruka, officially Ujedinjenje ili Smrt ("Unification or Death") was a secret group of Serbian nationalists (Pan-Serbians). It was founded in 1911 in Serbia.
Their aim was unification of countries Serbs lived in those days, including Bosnia-Herzegovina which was a part of Austria-Hungary since 1908.
They killed the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in 1914, which considered one of the WWI triggers.
They killed the King Aleksandar Obrenovic and Queen Draga Masin too.
In 1995 a street gang in Reading, United Kingdom took the name and have grown since.
