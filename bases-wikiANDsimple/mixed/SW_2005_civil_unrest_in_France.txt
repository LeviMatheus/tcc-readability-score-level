The 2005 civil unrest in France was a series of riots in October and November. Many cars and public buildings, for example schools were burnt. The riots startet in October 25, 2005 in Clichy-sous-Bois, a suburb of Paris. Afterwards they spread to other parts of France. Together they lasted for about 3 weeks. The riots were a reaction to the accidental death of two teenage boys and the serious injuries of another. The three boys hid in a power substation and got an electric shock, after being chased by police. However the boys did not commit a crime.

The "The New York Times" said the incident started at 17:20 on Thursday, 27 October 2005 in Clichy-sous-Bois. They said they know this from a police report. The police were called to a constuction site, because of a burglary. Three teenagers thought they were being chased by the police, so they climed a fence of a power substation. This was because the feared long questioning by the police. Another 6 teenagers were caught by the police for questioning by 17:50. At 18:12 at the local police station in Livry-Gargan the lights went out because of a black-out. This black-out was caused by the death of Zyed Benna and Bouna Traor√© in the power station and the injury of the third boy.
