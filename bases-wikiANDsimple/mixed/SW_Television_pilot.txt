Television pilot, usually called just a "pilot", is a test episode made to sell a television series. It may be broadcast as the first episode if the series is sold to a network or cable channel, and sometimes has different actors or other differences to the real series. There are also many series whose pilot episodes are titled "Pilot". While many pilots are made, few make it to the screen, and even fewer go on to become full television series because of big competition between networks and producers.
