A firearm (often simply called gun) is a device that can be used as a weapon that fires either single or several projectiles propelled at high speed by the gases produced through rapid burning of explosive material. Hand-held firearms, like rifles, carbines, pistols and other small firearms are rarely called "guns" among specialists.
In older firearms, the explosive material was typically black powder, but modern firearms use smokeless powder, cordite, or other materials.
For handguns and long guns, the projectile is a bullet or, in historical cannons, a cannonball. The projectile is fired by the burning explosives, but in small arms rarely contains explosives itself. For modern artillery the projectile is a shell, which nearly always contains explosives.
The smallest of all small firearms is the handgun (or "pistol").
