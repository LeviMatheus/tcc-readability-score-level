Enzymes are special molecules that work as catalysts. This means that enzymes speed up chemical reactions in the body. Enzymes speed up chemical reactions by lowering the amount of energy needed for a reaction to work. The substances at the start of the reaction are called the substrates. The substances at the end of the reaction are called the products. Enzymes work on the substrates, which later become the products.
One example of an enzyme is amylase. Amylase is found in saliva. Amylase breaks down starch molecules into smaller maltose molecules. These molecules are later broken down into even smaller glucose molecules. Another example is that lypase enzymes break down fats into smaller molecules.
Another example is Protease, protease is used to break down protein and it breaks it down into even smaller molecules, called amino acids.
All enzymes work properly only at one particular temperature and pH. All of your digestive enzymes have a optimum temperature of around 37-40'C. But their optimum pH vary. Enzymes are like eggs (they are both proteins). When you cook an egg you can not change it back. When enzymes reach a certain temperature they become denatured which means they are permanently changed and do not work.
