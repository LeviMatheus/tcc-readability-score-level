Eyeglasses are pieces of glass or clear plastic, called lenses, in a frame that holds them in front of someone's eyes.
"Corrective" lenses let some people see or read better, if they have problems seeing.
Sunglasses are a kind of eyeglasses that keep too much sunlight from getting in people's eyes.
