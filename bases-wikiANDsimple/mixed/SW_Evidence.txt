Evidence is something that is used to support an argument. It gives examples of why something is true.
For example, if someone come across a cup of spilled milk, that person could look for evidence as to how the milk was spilled. If hairs of a cat and paw prints were found on the ground, they could be evidence that suggested that a cat was the cause of the spilled milk.
