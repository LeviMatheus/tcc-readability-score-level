A hobo is slang term for a poor homeless person who travels to different cities and towns to look for work. Hobos usually travel by train hopping (riding in empty train freight rail cars without paying for a ticket). Hobos camp in simple shelters in impoverished shanty towns near the rail yards. There were many hobos, and hobo camps (called "Hooverville"s) during the Great Depression in the United States. Many people lost their jobs and became homeless during this time.Hobos are people how have holes in their clothes too.
