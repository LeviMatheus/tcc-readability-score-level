The King Cobra ("Ophiophagus hannah") is the world's longest venomous snake, with a length that can be as large as 5.6 m (18.5 ft). This species is found in a number of areas, found throughout south-eastern Asia and into Pakistan and India. Its genus name, "Ophiophagus", literally means "snake-eater", and its diet primarily consists of other snakes, including largere pythons and even smaller members of its own species. The venom of the King Cobra is primarily neurotoxic, and the snake is fully capable of killing a human with a single bite. The mortality rate can be as high as 75% without antivenin.
