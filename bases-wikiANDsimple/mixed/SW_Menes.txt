Menes was a pharaoh of the first dynasty of ancient Egypt. He lived ca. 3100-3000 BC. He brought together upper and lower Egypt to make an empire. He even wore both crowns the white crown of lower Egypt and the red crown of upper Egypt. He built the ancient Egyptian city Memphis and made it the capital.
There is extensive archeological evidence that there was a pharaoh named Narmer, but little evidence for Menes. There is a general suspicion that Menes either was a name of Narmer, his predecessor, or of his successor, Hor-Aha.
According to "Manetho", Menes reigned 62 years and was killed by a hippopotamus.
An image of Menes holding an ankh is on the frieze on the south wall of the U.S. Supreme Court building.
