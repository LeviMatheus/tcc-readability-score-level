Advertisment ban.
On the release of the Xbox, a TV advertisement was shown to advertise it. The advertisement featured a lady giving birth to a baby, which flew through the window. The baby started to look older and older as it flew through the air, shortly before crashing into its own grave. The advertisement then ended with the slogan "Life is short. Play more.".
