A fingernail is a hard part of the body at the tip of the fingers. Toenails are also similar, except that they grow four times slower and are on the toes. Only mammals have fingernails. Like hair, fingernails never stop growing. They must be cut from time to time. It is not painful when you cut your nails. The nails are composed of a protein called keratin. Hair and skin also contain keratin. Some people paint their nails to make themselves look nicer. Some fingernails can grow into the skin. This is called an ingrowing fingernail. They can hurt, so are often treated through medicine.
