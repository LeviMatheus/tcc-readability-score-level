Women's suffrage refers to women fighting to gain the right to vote. Before 1893, no women had the right to have their say about how the country was run. In 1893, after Kate Sheppard and her work mates had been demonstrating and raising awareness of the suffragette's fight, New Zealand women were given the right to vote after parliament (which was all men) voted for it. Many countries followed soon after, following similar battles.
