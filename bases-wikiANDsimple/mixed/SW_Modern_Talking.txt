Modern Talking was a German singing group. Its members were Dieter Bohlen and Thomas Anders.
In 1984, they became famous for their debut single "You're My Heart, You're My Soul". Later, they made other songs like "Cheri Cheri Lady" and "Brother Louie". "Brother Louie" was a "one-hit wonder" (a song from a band or group that only has one popular song) in the United Kingdom. The group split in 1987, but they returned in 1998 with their first album "Back For Good". That album sold 10 million copies worldwide. They separated again in 2003 and performed separately. After that, their albums were huge successes.
