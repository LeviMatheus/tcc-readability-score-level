Cargo is the name people give to goods which they transport, using a ship, airplane, lorry (truck), train or spacecraft. Please note that the noun is not countable, people will talk about "some" cargo. Today, the goods are usually packed in containers, which are carried. A place which loads or unloads cargo is usually called a "cargo terminal".
