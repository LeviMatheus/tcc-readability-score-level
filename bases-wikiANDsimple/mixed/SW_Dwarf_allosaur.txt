"Dwarf allosaur" is a species of theropod dinosaur that lived in Australia about 106 million years ago in the Cretaceous period. It is only known from an ankle bone, making it impossible to figure out the exact species. It is related to the Allosaurus but it is smaller and lived 30 million years after all other allosaurs had gone extinct. It is able to survive so long because Austro-Antarctica prevents other dinosaurs from migrating there.
It lived in the polar forest of Southern Australia, which is in the Antarctic circle during that time. It only lived there during the summer and would have migrated north during the winter because it would not survive the subzero temperature.
Besides its poor fossil record, it is famous for appearing in the BBC television series Walking with Dinosaurs.
