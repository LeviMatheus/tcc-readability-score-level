Politically, "Eastern Europe" may in fact cover all of northeastern Eurasia, since Russia is one single transcontinental country. Cyprus is also frequently taken to be a European state, although geographically it is in Asia. The same approach is also sometimes taken with the post-Soviet states of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus.
The borders of Eastern Europe are not clear as regions are not physical features that can be defined by neutral criteria.
In recent years, with the spreading of the European Union, many countries Eastern Europe have sharply increased their economies, quality of life and cities. This has also boosted tourism, the film industry, and even, to a lesser extent, immigration.
In many old sources, the term "Eastern Europe" still means such European countries that until the end of the Cold War (around 1989) were Communist states or countries under Soviet influence, i.e., the former Eastern Bloc. The majority of people in Poland, the German Democratic Republic, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia often consider their countries to be part of Central Europe rather than Eastern Europe.
