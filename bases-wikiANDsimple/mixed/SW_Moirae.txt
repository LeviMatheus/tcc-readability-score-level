The Moirae were the three goddesses of destiny in Greek mythology. They were Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos.
They controlled the life and destiny of everyone. Klotho spins the thread of life, Lachesis measures it (looks how long it is), and Atropos cuts the thread. When the thread is cut the person dies.
The parents of the Moirae are not surely known. Some said they were the daughters of Zeus and the Titaness Themis, or of primordial beings like Nyx, Chaos or Ananke.
Their Roman equivalent were the Parcae.
