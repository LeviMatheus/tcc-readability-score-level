A mitten is a type of protective clothing used to cover the hand. The word is usually used in its plural form ("mittens"), since people have two hands. Mittens are similar to gloves, in that they cover the hand and help to keep it warm in cold weather. However, while gloves have coverings for four fingers and a thumb, mittens only have a covering for all of the fingers, and for the thumb.
For sports.
Mittens keep a person's hands warm in very cold weather better than gloves. For this reason, people who do sports in very cold temperatures often wear mittens instead of gloves. Arctic explorers and snowmobile drivers in Northern Canada usually wear mittens in the extreme cold.
