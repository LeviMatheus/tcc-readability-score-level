Density is a measurement that compares the amount of matter an object has to its volume. An object with a lot of matter in a certain amount of volume has high density. An object with a little matter in the same amount of volume has a low density.
Fresh water is the only liquid with a density of 1.
The most common SI units for density are g/cm3 and kg/m3.
