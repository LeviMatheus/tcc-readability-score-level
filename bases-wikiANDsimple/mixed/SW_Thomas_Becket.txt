Thomas Becket was an English priest who was assassinated by four knights in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170. People used to think his name was "Thomas รก Becket", but it is now known to be wrong.
He was a close friend of King Henry II, but they argued about the rights the Church could have, and he was killed by four followers of the King. However, evidence shows that the King had no knowledge of the murder, and English stories say that he went around Canterbury being whipped as punishment for the attack on a close friend.
He became a saint in 1173. His major shrine is in Canterbury, but was destroyed by order of Henry VIII during his reign.
