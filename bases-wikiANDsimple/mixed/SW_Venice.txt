Venice is a city in Italy. It is the capital of the Veneto region, which is in the north-east of the country.
Venice is built on 117 small islands that are separated by 150 canals. People cross the canals by many small bridges. They can also be taken for rides along the canals in a type of boat called a "gondola".
The buildings in Venice are very old and attractive, and tourists come from all over the world to see them and the canals. This has made Venice one of the most famous cities in the world.
The most famous sights are the Rialto Bridge, St Mark's Basilica and the Doge's Palace.
Every year the city sinks a couple of centimeters because the ground is made from mud. Eventually the city will be completely underwater, but that will take years.
There are other ways to get around in Venice as well. The most common is the gondola, and also the vaporetto, which is a water bus and carries lots of people around the canals. Also there are motoscafi, motonavi and traghetti (ferries). You can use a motorboat, catch a taxi, or walk.
There are problems of rubbish in Venice, but it is still a popular tourist attraction.
