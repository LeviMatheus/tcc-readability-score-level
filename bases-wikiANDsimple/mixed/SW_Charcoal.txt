Charcoal is a carbon-containing substance made from wood, naturally black and powdery. Charcoal is made from wood by heating it in airless space in high temperature. The wood will not burn, but instead turn into charcoal. The by-product of making charcoal is tar and turpentine.
People use it for different things such as cooking on a barbecue grill, and in painting.
