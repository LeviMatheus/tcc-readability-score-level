A court, in law, is a part of the government that decides what laws mean when people disagree. Some disagreements a court may decide are whether a person is guilty of a crime, who is the legal owner of property, or who the children of two divorced parents should live with. A court is usually in a special building called a courthouse.
Most countries have many courts that deal with different issues. Some courts are higher and can change a decision made by a lower court.
