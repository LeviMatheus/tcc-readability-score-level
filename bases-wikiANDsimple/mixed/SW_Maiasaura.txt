Maiasaura was a large, plant-eating, duck-billed dinosaur. Maiasaura was the first dinosaur that was found alongside its young, eggs, and nests. This suggests that Maiasaura nurtured its young.
About Maiasaura.
Maiasaura lived about 80 to 65 million years ago in the late Cretaceous period. It was described as a kind and good natured dinosaur who ate plants, leaves and berries. It ate no meat at all since it was a herbivore. Its name Maiasaura means “Good Mother Lizard”. It was named this because scientists discovered that it looked after its young. Maiasaura measured about 9 metres long, 2-2.5 metres tall and weighed around 1800 kg.
Where they live.
Maiasaurs fossils were found in Montana, United States.
