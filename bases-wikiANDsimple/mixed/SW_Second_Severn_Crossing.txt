The Second Severn Crossing (Welsh: Ail Groesfan Hafren) is a bridge over the River Severn between England and Wales. The bridge carries the M4 motorway and is one of the main routes into South Wales. It was opened on 5 June 1996 to provide more traffic capacity than the original Severn Bridge, which opened in 1966. Both bridges are still in use although the newer crossing is more direct and less likely to be closed in strong winds.
