The Clifton Oyster Rocks are islands located off the coast of the Clifton neighbourhood of Karachi, Pakistan. The islands were controlled by the Pakistani Navy until 2006, when the Karachi city government decided to make island as part of its plans to renovate the city. As part of these plans, the Port Fountain was constructed at the base of the northern island. It shoots water up to 620 feet in the air, and is the second-tallest fountain in the world.
