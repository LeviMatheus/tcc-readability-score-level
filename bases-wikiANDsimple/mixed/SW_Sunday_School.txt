Sunday School is a kind of class found in many churches, mosques or religious communities. Before or after the main part of worship, a class is held to learn more about that church's teachings, and about the Bible or holy scripture of the religion. Sometimes the class is only for children, sometimes adults go there as well and sometimes there are different classes for adults and for children.
