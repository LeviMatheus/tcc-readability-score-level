The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is the most powerful part of the United Nations. The Security Council deals with maintaining peace and security between nations.
Membership.
The ten temporary seats are held for two years with member states (countries) voted in by the UN General Assembly on a regional basis. The Presidency of the Security Council (ie the leadership) is rotated alphabetically each month.
Powers.
If a country has behaved in a way seen as undesirable, the UNSC can make a ruling, known as United Nations Security Council Resolutions or sanctions. An example is that the UNSC has currently banned all imports of nuclear material to Iran as they feel Iran is going to make nuclear weapons.
