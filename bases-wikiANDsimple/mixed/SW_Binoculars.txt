Binoculars are a kind of tool that lets people see far-away things more clearly, using a technology called optics. They are made of a pair of tubes that are held in front of someone's eyes. The tubes have lenses that focus light using prisms, a process called magnification. This way, when someone looks through the binoculars at a far-away object, it looks much closer. They are most commonly used for birdwatching and amateur astronomy.
