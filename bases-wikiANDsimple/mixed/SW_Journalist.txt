A journalist is a person who works in journalism. There are different kinds of journalists: newspaper reporters, television journalists, etc.
A newspaper reporter is a person who works for a newspaper. Newspaper reporters write news articles and stories for newspapers. Newspaper reporters write these articles and stories by interviewing people, asking questions, and doing research.
Newspaper reporters must tell the truth when they write newspaper articles. Telling the truth is a very important part of all journalism jobs, including newspaper reporting, television news reporting, and radio news reporting. If people who work in journalism do not tell the truth in their articles or stories, they can be punished such as being suspended (don't work for a a short time) or fired (losing their jobs).
