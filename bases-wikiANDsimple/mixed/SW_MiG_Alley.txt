MiG Alley was a place during the Korean War that had a lot of North Korean MiG-15 Fagots in the area. It was over north west North Korea, near China. F-86 Sabres mainly fought the MiGs. Some of the pilots were Russian fighter pilots from World War II and were trained very good. They were called "honchos" (Japanese for "big shot"). The MiG-15s had less kills than the F-86s, so it is said that the Americans won.
