Cyanides are chemicals that contain the "cyano-group". In that group a carbon atom has three bindings to a nitrogen atom. This group is present in many substances. Many of them are gases, but some are solids or liquids. Those substances that can release the compound CN are highly poisonous.
Certain bacteria, fungi and algae are able to produce cyanides. Cyanides are also found in certain foods or plants. In plants, the cyanides are usually bound to sugar molecules. The cyanides serve as a defense against being eaten by herbivores.
In popular culture, cyanides are said to be highly toxic. As stated above, there are many cyanides that really are, but many others that are not. Prussian blue is given as a treatment to poisoning with Thallium and Caesium, for example.
The poisons referred to are usually hydrogen cyanide (HCN), and the chemicals which are similar to it, like potassium cyanide (KCN), and sodium cyanide (NaCN). (Such substances are called derivatives of hydrogen cyanide). Organic compounds that contain the CN group are called nitriles. Many of them are not as toxic as the ones cited before. Some of them are even used to produce drugs.
Some people think that glucose (sugars) may be an antidote against cyanide poisoning. They think that sugar can bind the free cyano group. That way the some of the poison could be neutralized.
