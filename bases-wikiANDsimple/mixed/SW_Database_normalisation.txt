Database normal form is a term used in Computer science. People use it when they talk about databases. Many databases allow data to store in many different ways. However, data may be easier or quicker to find if it is organised in some way. Currently there are 6 different ways people commonly use to organise their data. This process is known as Database normalisation.
Database normalisation is a process which is done when designing the database. It is about finding a tradeoff between the speed that different operations (like inserting, updating, deleting) take, and how much resources (cpu, disk) are needed. Sometimes, not all steps are done, or some are undone, to improve performance. This is known as "denormalisation"
