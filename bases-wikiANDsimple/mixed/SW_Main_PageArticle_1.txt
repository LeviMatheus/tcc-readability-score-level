Jessica Marie Alba (born April 28, 1981 in Pomona, California) is an American actress. When she was 13 years old, she got her first acting job. It was in the movie "Camp Nowhere". In 1994, she starred in her first television series, "The Secret World of Alex Mack". She became famous when acting in the television series "Dark Angel" (2000â€“2002). Alba later acted in several movies, such as "Honey" (2003), "Sin City" (2005), and "Good Luck Chuck" (2007).
She has been listed in the "Hot 100" section of "Maxim" magazine every year from 2003 to 2007, and was voted "Sexiest Woman in the World" by "FHM" in 2007. A picture of her was used on the cover of "Playboy". "Playboy" did not ask her if they could use the picture or tell her they were going to use it. This was the cause of a lawsuit that was later dropped. Alba has won several awards for her acting. These awards include the "Choice Actress" award at the Teen Choice Award and a Saturn Award. Both of these awards were for her acting in the series "Dark Angel".
