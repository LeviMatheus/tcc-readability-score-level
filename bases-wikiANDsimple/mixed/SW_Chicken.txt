A chicken ("Gallus gallus domesticus") is a domesticated bird. It is usually kept by humans as livestock, which means it is kept for its meat and eggs. Chickens are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances.
A male chicken is called a "rooster" or a "cock" (short for cockerel), a female chicken is called a "hen" and a young chicken is called a "chick".
Chicken can be farmed intensively. This is dangerous and can cause stress for the chicken.
