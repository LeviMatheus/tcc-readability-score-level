World War III is the name given to a possible third world war. This means that World War III has not yet happened, and might not ever happen.
Most people agree that if this war ever happens, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons will be used. "Nuclear weapons" get their energy from breaking or joining atoms. "Biological weapons" are living things, usually bacteria or viruses. "Chemical weapons" might not kill quickly, but poison people or their land. Together, nuclear, biological and chemical weapons are called Weapons of Mass Destruction. "Conventional weapons" on the other hand are "normal weapons", like guns or dynamite.
This could destroy much of the Earth and kill most living things. Also, it may kill all humans. Albert Einstein said "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones." This shows that he believed that after World War III, civilization as we know it will be gone.
A third world war does occur in the backstory of "Star Trek", before the Enterprise goes into space.
