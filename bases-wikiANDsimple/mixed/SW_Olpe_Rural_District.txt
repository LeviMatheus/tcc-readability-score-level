History.
The district was created in 1817 as "Bilsteiner Kreis", in 1819 the capital was moved to Olpe. During the reorganization of the districts in 1969 several of the municipalities in the district were joined together to become cities, but the district itself was only changed a little bit. Even in the second reorganization 1974 it stayed nearly in the same borders as in 1817.
