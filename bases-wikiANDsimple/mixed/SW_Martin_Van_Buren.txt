Martin Van Buren (December 5, 1782 â€“ July 24, 1862) was the eighth President of the United States. He was the first president born after the United States Declaration of Independence, making him the first to have never been a British citizen.

Martin Van Buren's formal education was acquired at the local village academy, from which he was graduated at the age of 14. Later he was placed in the law office of Francis Sylvester. There he swept floors, ran errands, and copied documents. Presumably through this exposure to the legal profession a young apprentice could learn enough law to gain admission to the practice of law.
