Alice Cooper (born February 4, 1948) is an American rock musician and singer. Originally, there was a band called Alice Cooper led by a singer named Vincent Damon Furnier. The band was one of the creators of a very theatrical and violent brand of rock music that was designed to shock. Alice Cooper drew equally from horror movies, vaudeville, heavy metal and garage rock to create a theatrical brand of rock music that would come to be known as "shock rock".
In 1974, Furnier legally changed his name to Alice Cooper and started a solo career. Cooper's solo career began with the 1975 album "Welcome to My Nightmare". Expanding from his early Detroit garage rock and glam rock roots, over the years Cooper has experimented with many different musical styles.
Alice Cooper is known for his social and witty persona offstage. "The Rolling Stone Album Guide" refered to him as the world's most "beloved" heavy metal entertainer. He helped to shape the sound and look of heavy metal. Cooper is also credited as being one of the first to bring storylined theatrics to the rock/pop concert stage in the late 1960s. Away from music, Cooper is also an actor, a golf celebrity, a restaurant owner and a popular radio DJ.
