Urban area is a word from geography. In an urban area, the population density (how many people live in a certain area) is higher than in the surrounding area. Many times, a minimum population density is also fixed. Urban areas are usually villages, cities and towns.
An urban area, with all connected areas (usually developed around some city) is called Metropolitan area.
