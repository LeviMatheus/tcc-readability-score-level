Baltic countries are three countries in Northern Europe at the eastern side of the Baltic Sea and at the southern side of Gulf of Finland. Baltic countries are Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Lithuanian and Latvian people speak Baltic languages and Estonian people speak Finnic language.
By their culture and history Baltic countries are close to Nordic countries. The biggest difference in the history was that Baltic countries were occupied by Soviet Union while Nordic countries (with the exception of Karelia, a part of Finland) were not occupied. Baltic countries had their freedom back when the Soviet Union came to an end. Today the Baltic countries are some of the richest and most advanced of those countries that were part of Soviet Union.
Paganism was the religion of Baltic people before most of them took Christianity long, long ago. Baltic paganism never died out and some people are still pagans.
