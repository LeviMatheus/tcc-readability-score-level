A nest is place animals build to hold their eggs and/or provide a place to raise their babies. Many times they are made of things like twigs, grass, mud, and leaves; or they may simply be a low place in the ground, or a hole in a tree, rock, or building.
Most people know that birds build nests. Some mammals, some fish, and some reptiles also build nests (to raise their babies).
