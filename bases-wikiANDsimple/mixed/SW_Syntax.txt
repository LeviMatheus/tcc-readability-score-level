In linguistics, syntax is the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences.
The term "syntax" can also be used to refer to these rules themselves, as in “the syntax of a language”. Modern research in syntax attempts to describe languages in terms of such rules, and, for many practitioners, to find general rules that apply to all languages.
