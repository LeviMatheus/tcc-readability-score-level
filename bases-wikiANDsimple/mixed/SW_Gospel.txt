The gospel is one of the four books in the Bible about Jesus Christ. The word gospel literally means "good news", since Jesus was born to save the world from sin and make humans know God.
These books are the first part of the New Testament of the Bible, and are put in a group of this order: the Gospel of Matthew, the Gospel of Mark, the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John. The "gospel" is mostly about the Death and Resurrection of Jesus. The Gospel was originally spoken, not written.
