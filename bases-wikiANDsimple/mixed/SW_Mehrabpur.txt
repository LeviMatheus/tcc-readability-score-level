Mehrabpur is a town and a tehsil in the Naushahro Feroze District of Sindh in Pakistan. It is on the main railway line between Karachi and Lahore. It is a junction station with a disused branch line to Naushahro Feroze.
On 19 December 2007, at 2:30 am an overcrowded express train travelling from Karachi to Lahore derailed 2 km south of Mehrabpur killing over 40 people and injuring hundreds more. Derailment seems to have been caused by defective rails.
