Biometrics is a field of study. It involves mainly biology, but also relies on computer science quite heavily.
The idea behind it is simple. Based on some easily measurable traits and behaviour patterns, the idea is to identify a human being with as little error as possible. One such way could be to take a fingerprint of every person, another one could be to let the person sign a document. The data could then be put into a form that a machine can read. At the border, people could again take the fingerprint or the signature, and compare it to the version stored in the passport.
When choosing features, those chosing must also look at social acceptance. Taking a fingerprint may be ok, taking a blood test may not be. Some biometric data is also easier to fake, eg. signatures.
Also, when voice samples are taken, these may be distorted (worsened), because only a telephone line is available. Telephone lines cut off some bandwidth from the signal.
Other than for passports, biometric methods are also used in some banks.
