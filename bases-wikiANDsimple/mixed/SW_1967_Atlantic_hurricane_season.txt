The 1967 Atlantic hurricane season officially began on June 1, 1967, and lasted until November 30, 1967. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. The season was fairly average, with eight storms forming.
Hurricane Beulah was the most notable Atlantic hurricane of 1967. A Category 5 hurricane, it killed 58 and made $217 million ($1.2 billion in 2005 US dollars) in damage as it crossed the Yucat√°n Peninsula and then made landfall a second time near the mouth of the Rio Grande river.
