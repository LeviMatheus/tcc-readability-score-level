"The Hundred and One Dalmatians, or the Great Dog Robbery" is a 1956 children's novel by Dodie Smith. Smith wrote a sequel called "The Starlight Barking".
The story.
After being invited to a dinner party by the Dearly couple, where Cruella de Vil expresses her dislike for animals, the family's new Dalmatian puppies disappear. The Dearly dogs are added to 97 puppies who are kidnapped or legally purchased from various owners, all of which have been gathered with the intent of skinning them for their fur, to make a coat. Through a fellowship of animals and the "Twilight Barking", the dogs are identified as being in Suffolk, England, and a rescue ensues.
Adaptations.
The novel was made into a Disney animated film in 1961, under the title "One Hundred and One Dalmatians". In this film the four adult dalmatians were compressed into two, with Missis being named "Perdita" and Prince being omitted totally. There is only one Nanny, who in personality and appearance resembles Nanny Cook. Patch and Lucky are present, but the Cadpig is not by name, though she is included in the Disney Channel TV series. Mr. Dearly, here named Roger Radcliffe, is a musician and composer, rather than a financial wizard like in the book. Saul Baddun is renamed Horace, and Cruella appears to be single. The villains discover the Dalmatians have stowed away on the moving truck, leading to a climactic car chase.
The Smith book has been released under the title "101 Dalmatians", at least as far back as a 1989 Egmont UK Ltd release.
