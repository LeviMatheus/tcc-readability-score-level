V3r & V3t.
The RAZR V3r and RAZR V3t are different versions the RAZR V3i. Instead of having iTunes, they have Motorola's Digital Audio Player (DAP) music player, which has no song limit, but takes longer to load, and uses more battery. However, it takes considerably longer time to load and uses the V3's battery at a much faster rate than iTunes does.
