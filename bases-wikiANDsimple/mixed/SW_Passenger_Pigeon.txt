The Passenger Pigeon ("Ectopistes migratorius") or wild pigeon was a species of pigeon that was once the most common bird in North America.
Description.
Once a common bird of eastern North America, the passenger pigeon became extinct very quickly. Early records, beginning in 1630, describe its migrations, roosting and nesting in enormous numbers, but by 1912 there were rewards offered for evidence of a live, wild bird.
