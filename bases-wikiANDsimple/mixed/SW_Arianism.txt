Arianism is a form of Christianity. It has come from Arius. Arianism has stopped being practiced today, but was important during the Roman era, into the Middle Ages.
Arianism opposed the dogma of the holy trinity
Belief.
The main difference between the beliefs of Arianism and other main Christian denominations is that the Arians did not believe in the Holy Trinity, which is a way that other Christian churches use to explain God. The information that we have today comes from the writing of people who were against Arianism and said the beliefs were wrong.
Between the First Council of Nicaea in 325, and the First Council of Constantinople in the year 381 there were no less than 18 different Creeds used by Arianists.
Arianism today.
In the 16th century there was again a movement against the belief in Trinity. A well-known person teaching this was Fausto Sozzini (1539-1604). Another one was Ferenc DÃ¡vid (1510s - 1579). These movements developed into what is called Unitarianism today. Unitarians believe that there is only one person in god, not the three-in-one dogma of trinity. Some of the teachings of Jehovah's Witnesses are close to some of the things Arians believed. It is different only in that Arians believed the holy spirit is a person and Jehovah's Witnesses teach it is not a person, but a force God uses to do His will. t would however be false to call them Arians, as they reject many Arian teachings. Mormons and Oneness Pentecostalism also reject the Trinity but for different reasons other than Arianism.
