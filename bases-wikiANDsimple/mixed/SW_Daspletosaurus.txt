Daspletosaurus (meaning "frightful lizard") was a tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that was 26-33 feet (8-10 m) long and weighed perhaps 2-3.5 tons (2300 kg). It had tiny horns behind its eyes and its arms were a bit longer than those of "T. rex". It may have been an ancestor of T. rex. This bipedal meat-eater lived in marshes by streams in what is now Alberta, Canada, during the late Cretaceous period, 76-72 million years ago. It may have preyed upon Triceratops. It was named by D. A. Russell in 1970. The type species is "D. torosus".
