Artificial selection is the intentional breeding for certain traits, or combinations of traits, over others, and is synonymous with "Selective breeding". It was originally defined by Charles Darwin in contrast to the process of natural selection, in which the differential reproduction of organisms with certain traits is attributed to improved survival and/or reproductive ability ("Darwinian fitness") in the natural habitat of the organism. Artificial selection that produces an undesirable outcome from a human perspective is sometimes called "negative selection" (but note that this term has a better-established meaning as a type of natural selection; see negative selection). Artificial selection can also be unintentional; it is thought that domestication of crops by early humans was largely unintentional.
