Hardcore Punk (or "hardcore") is a style of punk music that usually sounds louder, faster and more angry than earlier punk rock music from the 1970s. Hardcore began in the 1980s in North America. Some of the important bands of the genre are Bad Brains, Black Flag, Discharge, Minor Threat, and the Dead Kennedys. Hardcore songs often have more political lyrics (words) than songs from 1970s punk rock.
How it sounds.
Hardcore band singers often sing by shouting the words of the song. Hardcore songs often sound like the singer is angry. Hardcore bands use electric guitars, electric bass guitar, drums, and a singer. The electric guitars in hardcore bands are distorted and noisy because the people in the band have changed the guitar strings so they play notes that are lower than those a normal guitar can play.
