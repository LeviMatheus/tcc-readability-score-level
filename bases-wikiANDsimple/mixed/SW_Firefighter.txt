Firefighters or firemen are people whose job is to put out fires and rescue people. In a city, the building they work in is called a "fire station", or "fire hall". Firefighters work for the "fire department".
In some places, they are also taught first aid and given medical tools and training so they can help people injured other ways. A paramedic or an emergency medical technician (EMT) are names for people who have medical first aid training. Some paramedics and EMTs work for fire departments. Some work for other agencies such as ambulance companies or hospitals. Search and rescue is also done by many fire departments.
There are firefighters in cities and towns who fight fires in houses and other buildings. These are called "structural firefighters". There are also firefighters who fight forest fires and grass fires. They are called "wildland firefighters". They usually only work in the summer. Some fire departments in rural areas do both.
Firefighters have vehicles they drive to the fire. If the vehicle pumps water it is called an "engine". If it does not pump water it is called a "truck". Fire engines pump water and foam which is used to put out the fire. Fire trucks carry ladders and tools to help rescue people from burning buildings.
Firefighters must wear heavy clothing which protects them from the heat when they are fighting a fire. This is called "bunker gear" or "turnout gear".
