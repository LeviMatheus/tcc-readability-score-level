Futrono is one of the 12 municipalities of Valdivia province in the Los Lagos Region of Chile. It is located on the north side of the Ranco lake, but the town of Futrono is not on the shore.
This place was a territory of mapuches indigenous. They called this town, "Futronohue". Then, it becomes a port used to transport things to Puerto Nuevo, and after that to La Uni√≥n. In 1941, the municipality was created and that made it grow in population.
Now, Fortuno has much more activity, for example; agriculture, tourism and high quality furniture companies.
