Carrion is the carcass of a dead animal. There are several kinds of animal that feed on such meat, such as vultures, hyenas, condors, or Tazmanian Devils. Carrion is an important source of food for several kinds of carnivores and omnivores.
The Carrion beetles also feed on it. Some plants fake the smell of carrion (they smell like carrion), so that they will attract insects they eat. Predators do not normally feed on carrion, they hunt and kill the animals they eat.
