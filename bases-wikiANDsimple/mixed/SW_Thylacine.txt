Thylacines were carnivorous (meat eating) marsupial animals. The "Thylacine" was also known as a Tasmanian Tiger, a Tasmanian Wolf and a Tasmanian hyena. The last known "Thylacine" died in a Hobart zoo on September 7, 1936. They once lived across Australia and New Guinea. There are paintings of the animals in the north of Western Australia, and in the Northern Territory. At Riversleigh in north Queensland, scientists have discovered the fossil bones of thylacines that are at least 30 million years old. When the dingo came to Australia about 5,000 years ago, the thylacine slowly died out. By the time Europeans came to Australia in 1788, the Thylacine was only living in Tasmania. They were hunted because farmers said they were killing sheep. The Tasmanian government gave money to farmers for each thylacine they killed. They are now extinct, there are no thylacines left alive anywhere in the world).

The "Thylacine" was about 1.1 metres (44 inches) long and its tail was up to 53 cms (21 inches) long. It was grey and brown in colour with 16 black or brown stripes on its back. It had the same shape as a dog, but the back, rump and tail were more like a kangaroo. Its tail was quite stiff. It had very short legs. It had teeth like a dog, but with more incisor teeth. It also had a crescent shaped bag, opening to the back, to carry its young.
The "thylacine" was a nocturnal (night) hunting animal. They ate wallabies, rats, birds, echidnas, rabbits and sheep.
