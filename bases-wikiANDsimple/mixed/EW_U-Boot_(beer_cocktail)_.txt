A U-Boot is a beer cocktail that is made by dropping a bomb shot of vodka into a glass of beer. It is popular in Germany, Poland, North Macedonia, and Flanders. In Germany, the liquor korn is sometimes used instead, while in Flanders and the Netherlands, "jonge jenever" is preferred.
It is called a U-Boot (German abbreviation of "Unterseeboot", "submarine") because the shot glass of vodka sinks to the bottom of the glass of beer. The shot glass then "surfaces" when the cocktail is drunk.
In Flanders and the Netherlands, it is called a "Duikboot", literally translated "Submarine". It is seen as a variant on the "kopstoot" (lit. "headbutt") in the Netherlands. The "kopstoot" is a shot of jenever followed by a beer as a chaser.
In North Macedonia it is called "Подморница" - "Podmornica", literally translated "Submarine".
In southern Germany, U-Boot is usually served as a combination of Fanta and cognac instead of beer and vodka.
In Mexico, it is called "Submarino", Spanish for "Submarine". Instead of vodka, it uses tequila, and the shot glass must be left inverted inside the beer glass.
In Russia, it is most often called "Ёрш," (Yorsh) literally meaning a wire brush. It is also rarely called "Водолаз" - "Vodolaz," literally translated as "Diver."
In Sorbia, vodka and orange juice is used.
In Brazil, it is called "Submarino", Portuguese for "Submarine". In the south, where it is more easily found, it is common practice to use steinhäger instead of vodka.
In Sweden, it is called "Ubåt", Swedish for "Submarine". Jägermeister is used instead of vodka.
In Greece, it is called "υποβρύχιο", Greek for "Submarine". Served as a shot glass of Jack Daniels sink into the bottom of a short glass of beer.
