Donato di Niccolò di Betto Bardi (most people just called him Donatello) (1386 – December 13, 1466) was an Italian artist during the Renaissance. He lived in Florence and was very famous because he was one of the best sculptors of his times. He used special sort of sculpture technique, or way of doing things, called 'shallow relief', which made his work look very real.
He was the son of Niccolo di Betto Bardi, and was born in Florence. When Donatello was older, he studied with Filippo Brunelleschi the architect. He also helped the sculptor Lorenzo Ghiberti to make statues for the Battistero di San Giovanni. Some of Donatello's most famous works are statues of "Mary Magdalene" and a life-size statue of David.
