50 Cent burst onto the rap music scene in 2001, with his debut single "Wanksta". Since then, he has sold millions of records. His debut album, "Get Rich Or Die Tryin'" broke music records and went multi-platinum. In the summer of 2005, 50 Cent had a fight (or "beef") with The Game, a rapper in his G-Unit group. After this,The Game left G-Unit, and made some mean songs about 50 Cent. 50 Cent answered with songs like "Mr. Potato Head" and "300 shots" featuring G-Unit. It is widely thought that G-Unit won the beef. 50 Cent was also the first to sign onto a joint effort between Eminem's Shady Records and Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment.
