In some religions, a devil is a bad spirit that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words "the Devil" or "Satan" for the most powerful devil. The word "devil" comes from the Greek word "diabolos" which means "someone who tells lies to hurt you". ("Diabolos" is translated to the English word "slanderer.") The Christian New Testament uses "diabolos" as a title for Satan, and so "The Devil" became another name for Satan in English.
In the Old Testament, there is the serpent and the shaitan, who may be two different characters. "Shaitan" in Hebrew means "adversary" - an enemy or opponent.
