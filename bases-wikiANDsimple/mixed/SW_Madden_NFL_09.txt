Presentation.
On the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Nintendo DS versions, play-by-play and color commentary will be provided by Tom Hammond and Cris Collinsworth, respectively, replacing Al Michaels and John Madden. However, Michaels and Madden still appear on the Wii, PlayStation 2 and PSP versions. EA designers have confirmed that John Madden will have a part in Madden 09 as the person describing instructions to the Madden IQ. Madden will guide you on advice and other things to help you understand how to raise your Madden IQ. Madden also appears in Mii form in the Wii version of the game, suggesting plays to run in the game's "Madden's Pick" feature.
EA's relationship with ESPN will also enable tie-ins with different ESPN shows.
