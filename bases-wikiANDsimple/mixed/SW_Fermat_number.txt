A Fermat number is a special positive number. Fermat numbers are named after Pierre de Fermat. The formula that generates them is
As of 2007, only the first 12 Fermat numbers have been completely factored. These factorizations can be found at
If 2"n" + 1 is prime, and "n" > 0, it can be shown that "n" must be a power of two. Every prime of the form 2"n" + 1 is a Fermat number, and such primes are called Fermat primes. The only known Fermat primes are "F"0...,"F"4.
What they are used for.
Today, Fermat numbers can be used to generate random numbers, between 0 and some value N, which is a power of 2.
