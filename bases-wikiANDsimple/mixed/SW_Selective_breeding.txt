Selective breeding is a technique used when breeding domesticated animals, such as dogs, pigeons or cattle. Some of these animals will have qualities that a breeder will want to preserve. The breeder will therefore select those animals to breed that have such a qualty, rather than those that do not.
Charles Darwin used the example of selective breeding to introduce his idea of natural selection.
