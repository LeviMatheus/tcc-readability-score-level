"EastEnders" is a television program in the United Kingdom, that has been running since 1985, which has had over 4800 episodes. It is known as a soap opera. The program goes against "Coronation Street" and "Emmerdale".
The program is located an imaginary area of East London called Walford. Like "Coronation Street", most action centers around a local pub. The pub in "EastEnders" is called The Queen Vic. But unlike many soap operas in the United States or Latin America, "EastEnders" does not show a wonderful fantasy world of beautiful people but shows a very sad picture of "real life" in a "working class" area of the inner city.
Drug abuse, rape, racism, murder, kidnapping, prostitution, theft, senile dementia, arson and runaway children have all been part of various episodes of the program.
Conflict between members of one family or between different families is often central to the storyline.
