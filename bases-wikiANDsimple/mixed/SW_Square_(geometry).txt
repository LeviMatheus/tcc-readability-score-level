A square is a shape with four equal sides and four corners that are all right angles (90 degrees). The diagonals of a square also cross at right angles. The angle between any diagonal and a side of a square is 45 degrees. In fact, a square is also a rectangle because rectangles only need to have two parallel sides equal.
A square can also mean an open place, usually in a town, that is shaped nearly like a square; often because of a crossroads. Examples include Trafalgar Square in London, Times Square in New York and Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
In English slang, "square" can also mean "equal". For example in sports "all square" means that the scores are even.
