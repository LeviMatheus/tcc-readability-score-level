The Battle of Hastings took place on October 14, 1066. It was a fight between the English and Normans. The reason for the fight was that the ruler of the Normans, William of Normandy, had claimed that he was the heir to the English throne as his cousin Edward the Confessor had promised him the throne when he changed his mind on his deathbed. William of Normandy sent up to 700 ships across the English Channel and landed at small town named Pevensey. King Harold, King of England, sent his army south after defeating Harold Hardraada up north,waited in London before marching down his army to do battle with the Normans. What happened next is what is known as the Battle of Hastings. In this battle, the English leader (King Harold) was hacked to death by a group of norman soldiers. Many of the English soldiers ran away then, as they were not trained soldiers, but farmers because most of his trained soldiers deserted him because all the high ranking men got to have all the treasures of war, money and praise.
The result of the battle was a major Norman victory, allowing William of Normandy to take the English throne, and become king. This Norman control of the English throne will lead to other wars later, such as The Hundred Years War.
Hastings was the most important fight in the Norman Conquest.
