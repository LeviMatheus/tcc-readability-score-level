Klezmer is a kind of music. It was made by the Jews of Eastern Europe. It is a mix of Russian, Turkish, and Gypsy folk music and Jewish prayer music.
In old times, it was played during Jewish weddings and religious festivals, and it was made for dancing. The most common klezmer instruments are the clarinet and the violin, because they are the best to play in the sad klezmer style.
