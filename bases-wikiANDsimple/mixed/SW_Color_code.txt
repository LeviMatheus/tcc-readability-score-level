A color code is a system for displaying information by using different colors. Color codes are often difficult or impossible for blind and color blind people to understand.
"The Color Code" is also the title of a book (References, Joseph et al., 2002) combined with a nutritional practice by the same name in another book publication (Heber, 2001). "The Color Code" combines food science, medical knowledge and nutritional practices to encourage consumer intake of colourful plant foods for achieving optimal health.
