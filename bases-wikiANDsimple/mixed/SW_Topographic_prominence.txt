In topography, prominence, also known as autonomous height, relative height or shoulder drop (in America) or prime factor (in Europe), is a concept that is used in the categorization of hills and mountains, also known as peaks. It is a measure of the independent stature of a summit.
The prominence of a peak is the height of the peakâ€™s summit above the lowest contour line encircling it and no higher summit.
