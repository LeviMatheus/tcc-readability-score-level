"This page is about the common American idea of libertarianism. Other people (especially in Europe and Latin America) use the word libertarianism to refer to anti-capitalist libertarian or anarchism"
Libertarianism is an idea about government. A Libertarian is someone who thinks violence is allowed only for self defense. Libertarians believe no one has the right to start violence against other people or take other people's things.
In most countries, the government takes tax money from the people. This is supposed to be used to help the people. But some Libertarians think even the government has no right to tax people, and other Libertarians think that the government should not tax a lot. Libertarians think people can take care of the poor without the government. They believe that people should pay for the things that they want to use, but not have to pay for other things that they do not want.
Libertarians think everyone can decide what is good or bad for their own body. Libertarians think if adult people want to use drugs, they can do that, even if it spoils their lives. It is the drug user's own choice. Libertarians think if people want to drive cars without wearing seat belts, it is their own choice and they can do that.
Many libertarians also believe families and friends should look after friends so they would not use drugs, drive without seat belts, or do other things that are bad for them. But no one can force others to things that they do not want to do, or to stop doing things that they want to do.
