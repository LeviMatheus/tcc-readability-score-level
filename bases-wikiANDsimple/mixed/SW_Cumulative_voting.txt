Cumulative voting is a system for doing an election. There are a certain number of choices. Each voter has a certain number of points he or she can spread over the choices. That way it is possible to choose more than one option, and to weigh the choices.
Cumulative voting is used to elect representatives in many companies. It is also used to elect some governments. Switzerland and Germany use it for some elections.
It will lead to a proportional representation.
