Full communion is a term used in Christian ecclesiology to describe relations between two distinct Christian communities or Churches that recognise that each other shares the same communion and the same essential doctrines. That does not mean that there would be no differences at all between them.
The meaning of full communion is different in, on the one hand, Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Christian theology, and, on the other hand, in the theology of other Western Christians.
