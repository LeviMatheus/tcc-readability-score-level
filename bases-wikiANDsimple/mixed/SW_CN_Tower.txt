The CN Tower is a communications and tourist tower in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is tall. It became taller than the Ostankino Tower in Moscow while it was still being built in 1975, becoming the tallest free-standing structure on land in the world. On September 12, 2007, after holding the record for 32 years, the CN tower passed in height by the still-under-construction Burj Dubai. It is an important icon of Toronto and has more than two million visitors every year.
Construction of the tower started on February 6, 1973. It opened to the public for the first time on June 26, 1976.
Name.
The "CN" in the tower's name came from the "Canadian National" Railway, the railway company that built the tower. In 1995, the railway sold the tower to the Canada Lands Company (CLC). Local residents wanted to keep the name "CN Tower", though, so the abbreviation is now a shortened form of Canada's National Tower instead of the original Canadian National Tower. Neither of these names are commonly used, though; the tower is usually called the CN Tower.
