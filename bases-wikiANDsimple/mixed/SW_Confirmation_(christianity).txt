In Christianity, a baby might be baptised when they were young. When that baby grows to an adult, confirmation is used to make sure that the adult agrees with the promise to be a christian, made when they were baptised. Usually in an Anglican church, people can only take their first Holy Communion only if they do the confirmation.
