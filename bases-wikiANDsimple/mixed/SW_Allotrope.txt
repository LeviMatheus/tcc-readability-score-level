An allotrope is another form of an element, the element is very similar but the structure of the atom affects the chemical and physical properties. One can consider the many physical aspects in which a allotrope can be perceived. For example, to one person an article can be referred to as a nib, while another is a nub. The difference is very limited but can have large effects.
