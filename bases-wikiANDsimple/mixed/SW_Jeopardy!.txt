"Jeopardy!" is a game show on television. It was created by Merv Griffin in 1964 and it is still on television today.
Instead of a normal trivia game, where players try to give correct answers to questions, players on "Jeopardy!" have to give the questions to the answers that they were given as clues.
For instance, if the clue was, "This is a red fruit that grows on trees," then the correct response would be, "What is an apple?"
There are three different rounds in one game of "Jeopardy!": the Jeopardy! round, the Double Jeopardy! round, and the Final Jeopardy! round.
