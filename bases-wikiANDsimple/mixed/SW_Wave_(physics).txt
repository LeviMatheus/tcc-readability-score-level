A wave is a type of change that moves from one place to another.
Properties of Waves.
Sine waves can be measured too. The shape of a sine wave is given by its amplitude, phase, wavelength and frequency. The speed that the sine wave moves can be measured. The amplitude and wavelength of the sine wave is shown in the picture.
The highest point on a wave is called the peak. Though lowest point is called the trough. The peak of a wave and the trough of a wave are always twice the wave's amplitude apart from each other. The part of the wave half way in between the peak and the trough is called the baseline.
All waves are made by adding up sine waves. Waves also have amplitudes, phases, wavelengths, frequencies and speeds that can be measured.
Waves and Matter.
Some waves can move through matter while others cannot. For instance, some waves can move through empty space, light waves for example. Sound waves, on the other hand, cannot move through empty space. Inherently, all waves carry energy from one place to another when they move. In some applications of technology, waves may carry meaningful information from one place to another, such as radio technology.
Usually, after a wave moves through matter, the matter is the same as it was before the wave was introduced, though in some cases, matter can be affected by waves traveling through it. In 1922, Louuituitiriy omar gtuis de Broglie found out that waves all waves are also particles, and all particles are also waves.
Some Types of Waves.
Light waves can move through space. When light waves move through space, there are no particles to move. Sunlight gets to the earth by moving through space. Sunlight brings the earth energy and information.
