Ravidas, also spelt as Raidas, was an Indian saint of 15th century. He belonged to a family of leather workers. Traditionally, in Hinduism such families belong to Shudra group, the lowest level of traditional Hindu society. However, he became a disciple of Ramananda, another famous saint of that time. Ravidas became a great philosopher. He became an important supporter of Vaishanava bhakti movement, and wrote and explained about the cult of Vaishanavism. Some of his verses found place in Guru Granth Sahib, the main text of Sikhism.
Mirabai, a Rajput lady of a royal family of Rajasthan, was one of the followers of Ravidas. Even after 500 years millions of Hindus of all castes, including people who belong to highest Hindu castes, give respect to saint Ravidas. They follow his teachings and consider him their Guru, the teacher.
