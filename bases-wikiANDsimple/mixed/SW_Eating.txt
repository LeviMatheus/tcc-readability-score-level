Eating is when a person, animal, or other living thing takes in food, in order to get energy and nutrients. People and animals need to eat because they cannot make their own food like the plants. All the energy from eating comes from the Sun. Plants take the Sun's energy, and they are eaten by other animals. The animals then eat each other for the energy.
