The Rolling Stones were and are a very popular English rock band that formed in London, England in 1962. The founding members were Mick Jagger (vocals), Keith Richards (guitar), Brian Jones (second guitar), Bill Wyman (bass), and Charlie Watts (drums). The group was largely influenced by American blues and rock musicians like Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley and Muddy Waters in the beginning, and they had their first hits with covers (copies) of some of those artists. They become the prime rivals of the Beatles.
They hit it big in 1965 with the rock anthems "The Last Time" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction", a smash in the whole world. It was followed up by songs like "19th Nervous Breakdown" and "Paint It Black". In the "Summer of Love" 1967 they released a psychedelic LP-album, but were soon back into rock music in 1968 when they released the songs "Sympathy for the Devil" and "Jumpin' Jack Flash".
In 1969, Brian Jones quit the band and was later found dead in his swimming pool. A guitarist named Mick Taylor was his replacement. He played on some of the groups most successful material, including the hits "Brown Sugar", "Tumbling Dice", and "Angie", but he left in 1974. After that, Ron Wood has been the second guitarist in the band. A break-up of the band was threatening to happen in the 1980s, but since then, the Rolling Stones have remained active.
