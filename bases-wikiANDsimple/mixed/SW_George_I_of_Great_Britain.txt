George I (George Louis) was born in Osnabr√ºck, Germany on 28 May 1660, and was the ruler of Hanover in North Germany. He died while going back to Hanover from England on 11 June 1727.
When Queen Anne of Great Britain died in 1714, an act of parliament said the next ruler must be a Protestant. George was not the closest relative, but was the closest Protestant relative. Closer relatives were all Roman Catholic. George became King of Great Britain and Ireland on 1 August 1714.
Many people did not like the new king. It was thought that he did not speak English, but this may have been untrue.
He was the first ruler of Great Britain from the House of Hanover.
