The Pharaoh Hound is a breed of dog. Pharaoh Hounds are always bright orange in colour. They may have a small white spot on the front of their body. They need lots of physical exercise, and they are fast runners and can jump high. They need little brushing because their fur is very short. In the past, people used them to hunt rabbits. Now people keep them as pets.
