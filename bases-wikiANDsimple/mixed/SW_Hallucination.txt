A hallucination is when a person sees an image or hears a sound that is not really there.
Certain drugs can cause hallucinations. Some illegal drugs are taken because they cause hallucinations. Certain mental illnesses can also cause hallucinations.
What are the different types of hallucinations?
Hallucinations can affect all of a person's senses. People with the mental illness of schizophrenia may hear sounds or voices that are not really there. People with certain mental illnesses may also have hallucinations in which they see a person or thing which is not really there. People are less likely to have hallucinations in which they smell or touch something that is not really there. Certain forms of epilepsy can cause hallucinations. Finally, hallucinations can be the result of certain substances taken or of certain physical constellations. Most of the time, these substances are taken to get the hallucinations. Sometimes, (severe) lack of sleep, or high fever can lead to hallucinations brought on by such viruses as the common cold.
How many people are affected by hallucinations?
Many studies have shown hallucinatory experiences take place across the world. Several studies, one of them done as early as 1894, have reported that approximately 10% of the population experience hallucinations. A recent survey of over 13,000 people reported a much higher figure. According to the study, almost 39% of the people reported hallucinatory experiences. 27% of the people reported daytime hallucinations, mostly outside the context of illness or drug use. From this survey, hallucinations affecting smell or tasteseem the most common in the general population.
Mental illness.
People with mental illnesses such as Psychosis or Schizophrenia may see or hear things that are not really there. However, to the person hallucinating these hallucinations are very vivid. The affected person is unable to distinguish the hallucinations from 'real' experiences. Auditory hallucinations are most prevalent in schizophrenic patients. This can be very scary for the person having the hallucination. As well, it can be dangerous, because the person who is having the hallucination may do something dangerous. For example, if a person with schizophrenia is driving and they have a hallucination, they might hurt themselves in a car crash.
Diseases or illnesses.
Some diseases such as brain disorders or infections may cause a person to have hallucinations. As well, an alcoholic (person who is addicted to alcohol) who stops drinking alcohol suddenly may experience a type of hallucinations called delirium tremens (or "DT's"). Some people have hallucinations if they do not sleep for a number of days, or if they do not eat for a number of days.
Chemicals or drugs.
Some people have hallucinations because they purposefully or accidentally put chemicals or drugs into their bodies.
Illegal drugs.
Some people use illegal drugs that cause vivid (strong) hallucinations, such as LSD ("acid") and PCP ("angel dust"). Many illegal drugs will cause hallucinations if very large doses are taken, such as cocaine, heroin, crystal meth and hashish.
Legal drugs.
Some legal drugs that dentists, doctors, or surgeons use cause hallucinations. The dentists, doctors, and surgeons use drugs called anaesthetics to make people not feel pain, or to make people become unconscious. The main effects (result) of these drugs are that they make the patient not feel pain, or become unconscious. But the drugs also have some other additional effects, which are called side effects, such as nausea (feeling sick) and hallucinations.
Many dentists use an anaesthetic called nitrous oxide ("laughing gas"). Inhaling large quantities of nitrous oxide can cause people to have hallucinations. Doctors and surgeons use many types of anaesthetic gases so that patients who are being operated become unconscious. When a person inhales anaesthetic gases, they may have hallucinations for several minutes, until they become unconscious.
Accidental poisoning.
Some adults accidentally swallow a poisonous chemical because it is in a bottle that has the wrong label. In some cases, children swallow a poisonous chemical because they think that it is a food product or a drink. Some dangerous, poisonous chemicals which can make people very sick or even kill them also cause hallucinations.
Lack of sleep.
Some people have hallucinations when they have not slept for a long time; other people have something resembling a hallucination before falling asleep. This is usually called Hypnagogia. Most of the time, the people experiencing this kind of hallucinations are aware of the fact that they are not real.
