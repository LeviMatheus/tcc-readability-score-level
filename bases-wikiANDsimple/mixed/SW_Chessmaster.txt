Chessmaster aka (CM) is a gaming program made by Ubisoft. Chessmaster is stronger than most programs, although some high quality programs beat Chessmaster 10th edition, the latest version of Chessmaster series. Chessmaster 9000, a previous version, defeated Larry Christiansen, a well-known chess grandmaster, former United States champion. The original Chessmaster 2000 & CM2100 were produced by now defunct software toolworks coompany. CM was introduced to the public in mid 1986; the first person to play the program in an experimental mode on Atari system (fastest processor at the time), in 1984 was gambit king GM Jacob Yuchtman (1/14/1935-1/28/1985!), winning the match with perfect 5-0 score without any major problems.
