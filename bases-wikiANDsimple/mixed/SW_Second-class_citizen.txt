Second-class citizen is an informal term used to describe a person who is discriminated against within a state or other political jurisdiction, despite their status as a citizen or legal resident there. They might not be slaves, outlaws or criminals, but second-class citizens have limited legal rights, civil rights and economic opportunities, and are often subject to mistreatment or neglect at the hands of their superiors.
Second-class citizenry is generally regarded as a violation of human rights.
