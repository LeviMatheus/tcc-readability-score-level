Fluorescent light bulbs are a kind of light bulb that uses very hot gas to light up. They work by heating the gas until it turns into plasma - in this way, the electrons and positive nucleii separate and can move across the light bulb to carry charge. When this charge is carried across, it lights up the bulb by current, the flow of charge. It is this flow of charge that allows energy to be dropped from the battery or mains supply to the light bulb and give out light energy.
