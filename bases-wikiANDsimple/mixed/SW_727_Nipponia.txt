727 Nipponia is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the asteroid belt.
Nipponia was first found by Shin Hirayama in Tokyo on March 6, 1900. However, he was not able to find its orbit. After it was found again by A. Massinger on February 11, 1912, Massinger gave the honor of naming it to Hirayama, who chose the name "Nipponia", from a Latinization of "Nippon" (Japan in Japanese).
