A polymath (Greek "polymathēs", πολυμαθής, "having learned much") is a person with encyclopedic, broad, or varied knowledge or learning.
It means that the person knows a lot about many different things, not just one thing.
"Renaissance Man" and "Homo Universalis" are related terms to describe a person who is well educated, or who excels, in a wide variety of subjects or fields.
Three examples of "Renaissance Men" and "universal geniuses", so to say "polymaths" in the strictest interpretation of the word are listed here. The list includes the "Hakeem" of the Islamic Golden Age (also known as the "Islamic Renaissance"), who are considered equivalent to the Renaissance Men of the European Renaissance era.
