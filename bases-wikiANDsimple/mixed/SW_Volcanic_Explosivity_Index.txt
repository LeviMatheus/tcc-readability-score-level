In volcanology, the Volcanic Explosivity Index is the way to measure the strength of a volcanic eruption. In earthquakes, the Richter scale is used to measure the eartqhuake's strength, and the Volcanic Explosivity Index is used to measure the explosiveness of volcanic eruptions. The index is based on a scale of 1 to 8, 1 being very small, and 8 being huge and very rare. The largest eruption in modern times, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, was rated as a 5 on the index.
