A pesticide is a chemical that is used to kill or prevent animals (or organisms) which are considered to be unwanted. These organisms are called pests. Some of these pests that people do not want are insects, microbes that destroy plants, and other things that affect humans in a bad way. Many pesticides are poisonous, and are bad for not only the organisms it kills, but humans too.
Types of Pesticides.
There are different types of pesticides for getting rid of different pests.
Effects of Pesticides.
Pesticides are used to kill pests, but many are bad for human health. They may pollute water, and go into rivers, lakes, and ponds. This will cause acid rain, and organisms living in the water can get sick and die, because the water where they live has more acid.
Pesticide runoff is very bad for animals, especially amphibians.
