Electronic engineering is a discipline investigating all kind of situation related with electricity
and magnetism. electronic engineers are concerned with transferring of information using radio waves, the design of electronic circuits, the design of computer systems and the development of control systems such as aircraft auto-pilots.
The term electronic engineering is started to emerge in the late 1950s, the subject was known as radio engineering. Before the Second world war, Electronic engineering was commonly known as a 'radio engineering'.At this time, studying radio engineering at university considered as part of a physics degree. Later, in post war years, as consumer devices started to be developed, the field broadened to include modern TV, audio systems,
Hi-Fi and latterly computers and microprocessors. In the mid to late 1950s, the term radio engineering gradually gave way to the name electronic engineering, which then became a stand alone university degree subject.
Fundamental objects of discipline are the sciences of physics and mathematics as these help to get both qualitative and quantitative description of how such systems will work. Today most engineering work involves the use of computers and it is commonplace using computer-aided design programs when designing electronic systems.
