"Neotominae" is a subfamily of the family Cricetidae. It consists of three tribes, 16 genera, and many species of New World rats and mice. Most of them are found in North America. Among them are the well-known deer mice, white-footed mice, packrats, and grasshopper mice.
Neotomines are related to the other two subfamilies of mice in the New World, Sigmodontinae and Tylomyinae. Many authorities place them all in a single subfamily, Sigmodontinae.
