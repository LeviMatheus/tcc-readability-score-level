George Washington Carver (c. 1864-5 â€“ January 5, 1943) was an American educator, botanist (someone who works with plants), and inventor. He is best known for his work with peanuts, sweet potatoes, and other crops. He was born into slavery. Carver used his imagination to come up with over 300 ways to use peanuts, including shampoo and shaving cream. He was also a Christian.
