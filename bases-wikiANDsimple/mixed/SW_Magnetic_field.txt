A physical field is a spatial distribution of a scalar or vector quantity. The Magnetic field is the area around a magnet in which a magnetic force is exerted. Moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. Magnetic fields are usually shown by magnetic flux lines. At all times the direction of the magnetic field is shown by the direction of the magnetic flux lines. The strength of a magnet has to do with the spaces between magnetic flux lines. The closer the flux lines are to each other, the stronger the magnet. The further apart they are, the weaker the magnet. The flux lines can be seen by placing iron filings over a magnet. Magnetic fields give power to other particles that come in contact with the magnetic field.
In physics, the magnetic field is a field that permeates space and which exerts a magnetic force on moving electric charges and magnetic dipoles. Magnetic fields surround electric currents, magnetic dipoles, and changing electric fields.
When placed in a magnetic field, magnetic dipoles align their axes to be parallel with the field lines, as can be seen when iron filings are in the presence of a magnet. Magnetic fields also have their own energy and momentum, with an energy density proportional to the square of the field intensity. The magnetic field is measured in the units of teslas (SI units) or gauss (cgs units).
There are some notable specific incarnations of the magnetic field. For the physics of magnetic materials, see magnetism and magnet, and more specifically ferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and diamagnetism. For constant magnetic fields, such as are generated by stationary dipoles and steady currents, see magnetostatics. For magnetic fields created by changing electric fields, see electromagnetism.
The electric field and the magnetic field are components of the electromagnetic field.
