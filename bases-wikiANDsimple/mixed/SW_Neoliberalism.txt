Neoliberalism is a term for different social and economic ideas. Originally the term was used by a group of liberals who helped shape social market economy in the mid 20th century. Today, it is mostly people who are critical of the ideas of globalisation as well as trade unionists who use the term.
The ideas were developed by the economists Friedrich Hayek, Wilhelm RÃ¶pke, Walter Eucken, as well as other less prominent thinkers. They were first presented at a conference in 1938.
What do Neoliberals want?
Neoliberals are openly against lobbying of groups, state interventions that aim to protect national interests, like import duties or subsidies. Neoliberalism is also against totalitarian regimes or a centrally governed economy. What it more it frowns upon the Laissez-faire of classical Liberalism.
