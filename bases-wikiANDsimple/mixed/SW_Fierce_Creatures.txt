"Fierce Creatures" is a 1997 comedy movie. The movie was written by John Cleese and directed by Fred Schepisi and Robert Young.
The story is based around a British zoo. The zoo has recently been bought by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain (played by Kevin Kline) and put under the management of Rollo Lee (Cleese). In order to gain more money, Lee decides to use a "fierce creatures" policy. This means that only animals which could kill people would be kept in the zoo.
