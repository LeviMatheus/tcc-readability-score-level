Lust is a term for a strong desire or wanting, or maybe even needing, often for sexual acts, although it is also commonly used to talk of a "lust for life" or a "lust for power" or for other goals.
As a sexual desire, it is considered a vice (a failing) by Christianity, which lists it as one of the seven deadly sins.
"Lust" was originally an Anglo-Saxon word which meant "desire" or "appetite".
