A metre (US spelling, "meter") is the basic unit of length in the SI measurement system. The abbreviation for the metre is m. According to the earliest definition (dating to the French Revolution), it was 1/10,000,000th (one ten-millionth) of the distance between the Earth's equator and the North Pole along the Paris meridian. The metre is now officially defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458th of a second.
