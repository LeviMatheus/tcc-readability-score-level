William Godwin (3 March 1756 â€“ 7 April 1836) was an English journalist, political philosopher and novelist. He is considered one of the first exponents of utilitarianism, and one of the first modern proponents of philosophical anarchism. Godwin is famous for two books that he published within the space of a year: "An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice", an attack on political institutions, and "Things as They Are or The Adventures of Caleb Williams", which attacks aristocratic privilege, but also is virtually the first mystery novel.
