Germs are bacteria, amoeba, protozoa and other tiny (microscopic) animals that can cause people to become sick. Most germs are of only single cell but they multiply so fast in the human body that they cause sickness. This does not include viruses, since most experts say viruses are not really alive. But many people may call viruses "germs" also, in everyday speech.
