The MiG-29 Fulcrum is a fighter aircraft made by Russian aircraft company Mikoyan. It first flew in 1977, and was introduced in 1983. It was made by the Soviet Union during the Cold War so it could fight new American fighters like the F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-18 Hornet. It is still used by the Russian Air Force and other countries in Europe and Asia.
