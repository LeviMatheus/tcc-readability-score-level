The Americas is a term used to refer to the American supercontinent: the continents of North America, South America, and the isthmus of Central America. The Americas are located in the Western Hemisphere and cover 8.3% of the earth's surface. Notice because this is a plural noun, "the" needs to be used in a complete sentence.
The word American is usually used to mean a person or a thing from the United States of America. People and things from any country in any of the Americas -- North America, Central America, or South America -- are sometimes called "American" or Panamerican.
