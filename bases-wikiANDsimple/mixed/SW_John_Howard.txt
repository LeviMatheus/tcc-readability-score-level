John Winston Howard (born 26 July 1939) was the 25th Prime Minister of Australia. John Howard is a member of the Liberal Party. John Howard was the leader of Australia from 1996, when he won the election against Paul Keating of the Labor Party, until 2007 when he lost the election to Kevin Rudd of the Labor Party. John Howard has been the leader of Australia longer than anyone except Robert Menzies, who was also a Liberal.
John Howard was a lawyer before he became a politician. He was in parliament from 1974 until 2007. From 1977 to 1983 he was the Treasurer in Malcolm Fraser's government. Malcolm Fraser lost the 1983 election to Bob Hawke. Some people said this was because many people did not have jobs.
In 1995, the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was not popular after 13 years of Labor government and in 1996 John Howard became Prime Minister of Australia. In 1998 John Howard's government held a referendum on whether Australia should become a republic and have a President instead of a Queen. However, John Howard did not support the referendum and told people to vote no.
After the September 11 attacks, John Howard focused on world issues. He was friends with George W. Bush who is the leader of the United States. George Bush called John Howard a "key ally". John Howard sent SAS troops to Afghanistan and Iraq to support the United States, and signed a free trade agreement with the United States. Despite this alliance, Australia remained fairly neutral on Israel and Palestine.
Australia was successful while John Howard was leader. However, some people say he did not help poor people, and ignored global warming. In 2005, he made it easier for bosses to get rid of workers, and the Labor Party became more popular. On 24 November 2007, Kevin Rudd won an election and John Howard stopped being Prime Minister. John Howard also lost his seat in the Parliament.
