In psychology, an archetype is a model of a person, personality, or behavior.
In the analysis of personality, the term "archetype" is often broadly used to refer to
But in a strict linguistic sense, an archetype is merely a defining "example" of a personality type. In this sense "mother figure" can be considered an archetype and instances can be found in various female characters with distinct personalities.
Archetypes have been present in mythology and literature for hundreds of years. The use of archetypes to analyze personality was advanced by Carl Jung early in the 20th century. The value in using archetypal characters in fiction derives from the fact that a large group of people are able to unconsciously recognize the archetype, and thus the motivations, behind the character's behavior.
Etymology.
The word "archetype" appeared in European texts as early as 1545. It derives from the Latin noun "archetypum" via the Greek noun "arkhetypon" and adjective "arkhetypos", meaning "first-moulded". The Greek roots are "arkhe-" ("first" or "original") + "typos" ("model", "type", "blow", "mark of a blow").
