Wine is an alcoholic drink. Society usually uses the word for the drink made from the juice of grapes, although people sometimes call alcoholic drinks made from the juice of other fruits (such as plums or blackberries) "wine". This article only deals with wine made from grapes.
Wine is made by the fermentation of the sugar in grapes. There are two main types of wine, red wine and white wine. Ros√© wine is made by leaving red grapes in skin contact for very short. The colour comes only from the skin, so if you have short skin contact, the wine will not turn red but only "pink" (rose wine). Wine sometimes has bubbles in it; this wine is called sparkling wine. The most popular sparkling wine is champagne.
People have been making wine for about 5000 years.
