John Locke (August 29, 1632â€“October 28, 1704) was an English philosopher of the late 17th century. He said that people should use thinking to search for the truth, rather than simply accepting the ideas of authorities (people in power), or the ideas of superstition and other unscientific beliefs. Locke was awarded a bachelor's degree in 1656 and a master's degree in 1658.
Political Beliefs.
His idea of the purpose of the ruler was to establish order in society, and believed that the ruler's power should be limited. Locke believed that there should be a "contract" or agreement between the ruler and the ruled. He believed that the ruler should be able to stay in power as long as they had the consent of the people that they governed. He also believed that the reason men entered into society was to claim their possessions.
Locke also believed that people are basically reasonable, and would cooperate with each other. The government, in Locke's view, was responsible for protecting the rights of the people. John Locke did not like the idea of government, he thought that all men gave up their freedoms given to them by nature, but he saw it as a necessary institution. His biggest and most basic beliefs include that humans are granted every possible right to their life, liberty, and property.
