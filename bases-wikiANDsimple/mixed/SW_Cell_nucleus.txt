A cell nucleus is a part of the cell. The nucleus is small and round. It works as the brain of the cell. It contains genes that have DNA inside it, which are the building blocks of life. The human body contains billions of cells and that means billions of "nuclei" (nuclei is the plural of Nucleus).
An example of a nucleus is an egg yolk. Ostrich eggs have the largest yolks and that means they have the largest nuclei. Some viruses attack the nucleus of a cell to use it to make more viruses.
Some animals (like amoebas) are animals made up of one cell and they reproduce by splitting in half. This means that an amoeba is a "single-celled organism" (living thing). Many bacteria are single-celled organisms.
The Nucleus is part of the cytoplasm it is small and round
