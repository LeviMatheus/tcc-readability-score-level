Dingo (plural: dingoes) is a mammal found in Australia and South-East Asia. Dingoes are similar to domestic dogs. Most dingoes in the wild are no longer purebreed dingoes.
Dingoes were brought to Australia from South-East Asia.
Dingoes are usually between 48cm to 58cm from nose to tail. They usually weigh between 23kg and 32kg. The colour of their fur is usually yellow-ginger, but can sometimes include tan, black, white or sandy colours.
Dingoes live in packs of between 3 and 12, but they can be seen alone as well. The leaders are the alpha male and the alpha female and are usually the only pair to breed. Young dingoes are called "cubs". Adult females usually give birth 5 cubs in a litter.
Dingoes do not bark like other dogs, but they do howl.
Dingoes are carnivores and eat other animals.
Some people keep dingoes as pets.
