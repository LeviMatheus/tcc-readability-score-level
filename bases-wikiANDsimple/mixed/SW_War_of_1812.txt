The War of 1812 was fought between the British Empire and the United States from 1812 to 1815 on land in North America and at sea. More than half of the British forces were made up of Canadian militia (volunteers)because British soldiers had to fight Napoleon in Europe. The British defeated the attacking American forces. In the end, the war created a greater sense of nationalism in both Canada and the United States.
The War.
Some people in the United States wanted to achieve full independence. Some people also wanted to expand into Canadian territory. The war began, when the United States started to attack the Canadian provinces in 1812 and 1813, but the borders were successfully defended by the British.
The final battle of the war took place in January of 1815. The British attacked New Orleans and were beaten by the Americans and General Andrew Jackson. The battle took place after the peace treaty had been signed. It was during this battle that a poem was written by an American soldier, Francis Scott Key. The poem was used as the new national anthem for the United States: "The Star Spangled Banner".
Peace.
The War of 1812 ended with the signing of the Treaty of Ghent on Dec 24, 1814, in Belgium. Both sides thought they had won, but no great changes took place. News of the peace treaty did not reach the US until after the battle in New Orleans in January 1815. There was no actual winner of the war, but many Americans say they won, and Canadians say they won and most British people don't really say anything about it.
