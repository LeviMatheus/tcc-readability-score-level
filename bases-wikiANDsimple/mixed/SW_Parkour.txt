Parkour is an activity with the aim of moving from one point to another (efficient and fast), using the abilities of the human body. Parkour help to overcome barriers, and is practiced in rural and urban areas. Parkour practitioners are called to as "traceurs", or "traceuses" for females.
Founded by David Belle in France, practitioners only use efficient movements to develop your body and mind to be able to overcome barriers in an emergency. It may also be a form of entertainment or hobby.
Acrobatics (such as flips and wall flips) are not part of parkour, because of inefficient in a difficult situations (emergency).
Overview.
Parkour is a physical activity which is difficult to categorize. It is not an extreme sport, but an art or discipline that resembles self-defense in the martial arts. David Belle explain that the spirit of parkour is guided in part by the notions of "escape" and "reach", using quick thinking with dexterity to get out of difficult situations. So, when faced with a hostile conflict with a person, someone will speak, fight, or flee. As martial arts are a form of training for the fight, parkour is a form of training to escape from damage. Because of its unique nature, it is often said that parkour is in its own category: "parkour is parkour."
An important characteristic of parkour is efficiency. Practitioners moves not only as fast as they can, but also in the least energy-consuming and most direct way possible. This characteristic distinguishes it from the similar practice of free running, which places more emphasis on freedom of movements, such as acrobatics. Efficiency also involves avoiding injuries, shor and long-term..
Parkour is also known to have an influence on practitioner's thought process. Traceurs and traceuses experience a change in their critical thinking skills which helps them overcome physical and mental obstacles in everyday life.
