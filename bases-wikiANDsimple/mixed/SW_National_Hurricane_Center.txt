The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC for short), is a department of the National Weather Service's Tropical Prediction Center, which is responsible for tracking and forecasting the likely behavior of tropical depressions, tropical storms and hurricanes. The NHC headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.
When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are predicted within 36 hours, the center issues the proper watches and warnings through the news media and NOAA Weather Radio. Although it is an organization of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has designated the NHC as Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern and central Pacific Ocean. In other words, the NHC is the central source of information for all tropical cyclone forecasts and observations happening in these areas, despite of their effect on the US.
