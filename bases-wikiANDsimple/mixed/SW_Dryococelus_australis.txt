The Lord Howe Island stick insect ("Dryococelus australis") was thought to have died out in 1930, but more were found in 2001. It no longer lives in its largest habitat; Lord Howe Island, and has been called "the rarest insect in the world"
, because there are less than 30 living today on the small islet of Ball's Pyramid.
