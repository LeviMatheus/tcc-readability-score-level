The Flesch-Kincaid Reading level measures textual difficulty and tells you the grade level of a text.
The Flesch-Kincaid index tells how easy something is to read. It does this by counting the number of syllables in every word and the number of words in every sentence. Then some math is done. The number will represent a grade-school level. For example, a sentence with a score of 8.0 means that someone in 8th grade could understand it. Normal writing is usually between 7 and 8.
