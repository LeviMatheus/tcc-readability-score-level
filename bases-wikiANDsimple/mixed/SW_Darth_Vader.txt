Character history.
Born as Anakin Skywalker on Tatooine, he was converted by Palpatine to join his cause and accepted to learn the ways of the dark side of the Force, defying his master Obi-Wan Kenobi. Darth Vader died in "Return of the Jedi", but not before returning to the light, thanks to his son, Luke Skywalker. His mask lets him breathe and makes noise when he does so.
