When talking about file systems, a directory (also called Folder, or Catalog) is a way to organize computer files. Related files or those belonging to a specific project can be kept in the same directory. A directory can also contain other directories. For many applications, there is the notion of current working directory. This is the directory that the application runs in. Some operating environments restiric what the users can see to what is in certain directories. In Unix and Linux, a directory is a special type of file.
