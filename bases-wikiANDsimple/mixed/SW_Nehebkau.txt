Nehebkau guarded the entrance to Duat, the Egyptian underworld. He was made up of Ka and Ba, the two parts of the soul. he is pictured as a snake with two heads. Atum was said to have to keep his finger on Nehebkau to keep him from being out of control. Since he was a snake, he was believed to heal those bitten by snakes and/or scorpions.
