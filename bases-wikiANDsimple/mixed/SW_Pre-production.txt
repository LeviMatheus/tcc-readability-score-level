Pre-production is the time before making a movie, play, or other performance when all the things that will be needed to make it are prepared.
In the Film Industry, pre-production usually only starts when the script is ready and the studio has agreed to make it and to give the money to do it. At this time, a project will almost always have a director, a cast and a production team given to it to start working.
