The 1994–95 NHL season was the 78th regular season of the National Hockey League. Twenty-six teams each played 48 games, a shortened season, due to a lockout of the players by the owners. For the first time since the 1969–70 NHL season, no team averaged more than four goals scored per game. A total of 60 shutouts happened in the 624 regular-season games.
The New Jersey Devils won the Stanley Cup in a four-game sweep of the Detroit Red Wings. An unusually high number of shorthanded goals (28) were scored in the 81 playoff games of 1995. In addition, 7 hat-tricks were recorded in the 1995 Playoffs.
Regular season.
The shortened season ended much later than usual. For the first and, as of 2007, the only time in NHL history, the Stanley Cup Finals concluded after the Summer Solstice. Despite the late end to the playoffs, only 79 total playoff games were held, the lowest number to date under the "16 wins" playoff format.
