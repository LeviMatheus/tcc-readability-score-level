Lampyrideae is a family of beetles. These beetles are special in that most of them have the ability to produce light. Commonly, they are also called Fireflies or Lightning bugs. There are about 2000 different species. Most of them are nocturnal. They use flashes of light to attract mates.
Most species live in marshes or near water, because there their larvae have more than enough food.
