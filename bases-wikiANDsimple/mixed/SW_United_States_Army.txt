The United States Army is a branch (or section) of the United States Armed Forces.
The army mainly deals with land based missions and operations. The army started as the Continental Army from 1775 to August 7, 1789 when the War Department (now known as the Department of Defense) was formed. Officially a person (or member) in the army is called a soldier. The soldier must take orders from a person in charge known as a CO or commander. When a person joins the Army, they must serve for a certain amount of time or a "tour of duty". A new soldier or recruit must go through training called boot camp to become a soldier. Each soldier is trained in a variety of weapons and equipment to carry out commands.
