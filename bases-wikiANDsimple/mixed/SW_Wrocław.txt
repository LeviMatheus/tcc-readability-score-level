History.
Wrocław is over 1000 years old. It was originally a Slavic town. During the Middle Ages it became a German city. It was called Breslau for a long time. During the Second World War the city was badly damaged. About 70% of the buildings were damaged. Many of them were rebuilt. After the war, the city became Polish again, and the German citizens were forced to leave. It has been called by its Polish name Wrocław ever since.
