Control engineering is the engineering field that focuses on mathematical modeling of systems of a various nature, analyzing their dynamic behavior, and using control theory to create a controller that will cause the systems to behave in a desired manner. Modern control engineering is closely related to electrical, electronic and computer engineering, as electronic circuits can often be easily explained using control theory techniques. And also it is related to biological unit.Control engineering needs Electrical circuits, antenaa and very small control unit. And as engineering is developing, control engineering is often desired. For example, there are automobile, biologcal engineering, wireless communication, and etc.
In most of the cases, control engineers make use of feedback when designing control systems. For example, in an automobile with sail control the machine's speed is continuously checked and fed back to the system which adjusts the motor's spin power accordingly. Also resently, control system is used in nano technology. And the field of control within chemical engineering is known as process control. For example, we can change chemical process fast and easily. Many developments were invoked by this process control. Like this, Control engineering has a lot if fields that include science, finance management, and even human action.
So, What is the important thing of control engineering? The answer is feedback. But control engineers may also work on the control of systems without feedback. This is known as open loop control. An open-loop controller, also called a non-feedback controller, is a type of controller which count its input into a system using only the current condition and its model of the system. A classic example of open loop control is a washing machine that works through a scheduled cycle without the use of units.
