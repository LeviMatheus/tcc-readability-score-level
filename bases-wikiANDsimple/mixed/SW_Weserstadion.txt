History.
The Weser stadium was built in 1909 by Bremen's "Allgemeiner Bremer Turn- und Sportverein" as a sports field. After its first change in the year 1926, it was given the name "ATSB Kampfbahn". Today's name, which goes back to the direct situation at the Weser river, exists since the year 1930. Since this time there also the sports association Werder Bremen makes its plays. At the beginning of the first season of the soccer Bundesliga in the year 1963 the stadium received its first roofed grandstand. In the following decades also the other grandstands were built and modernized gradually. 1992 for the first time in a stadium a VIP Loge was inserted.
