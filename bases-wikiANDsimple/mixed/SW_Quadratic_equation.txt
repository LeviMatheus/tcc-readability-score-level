The Quadratic Formula.
Where the letters are the corresponding numbers of the original equation, formula_1. a is not 0
Proof.
The quadratic formula is proved by "completing the square",
move formula_5
Use the method of "completing the square"
The left side is now a perfect square; it is the square of
The right side can be a single fraction, with a common denominator 4"a"2.
Find the square root of both sides.
