The Etruscans were people in North Italy who became part of Rome. Many of the Gods below became part of the Roman pantheon.
Very little Etruscan writing has survived: Only two short, incomplete texts, and some grave inscriptions (writing on stone). No-one can read or write the Etruscan language very well now. Roman people wrote about the Etruscans but what they wrote is now lost.
The main three gods were Tinia, Uni and Menrva.
