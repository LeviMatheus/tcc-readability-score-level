A freeway is a highway made for vehicles to safely travel at fast speeds. They do this by using bridges that go above or below other roads with ramps that connect them. Many freeways do not allow slower traffic, such as bicycles and pedestrians, to enter them.
Most freeways are divided with at least two lanes going each way, but they can be as wide as four lanes in large cities. The word "freeway" was made in the 1930s when people wanted to make roads in New York City better. They are used in Canada, Taiwan, Australia, and the United States as well as other countries.
