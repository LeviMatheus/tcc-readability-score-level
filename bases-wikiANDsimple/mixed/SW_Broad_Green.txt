Broad Green is a small area with a lot of houses at the centre of West Croydon in the London Borough of Croydon, England. The area is mostly filled with a triangular green space which includes shops and large houses. The green was built at the end of the 19th century. Most of West Croydon is in an electoral ward called "Broad Green", hence Broad Green library is some distance from the traditional Broad Green area. Parts of West Thornton and Selhurst wards are also in West Croydon.
