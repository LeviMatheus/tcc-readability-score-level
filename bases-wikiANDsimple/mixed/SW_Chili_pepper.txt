Chile pepper (also spelled Chili pepper, Chilli pepper; often shortened to chile, sometimes called Pepperoni) is the fruit of a series of plants called Capsicum (nightshade family). Those plants are now grown all over the world, but originally, they came from South America. They are used as spices or as vegetables, and also have some use in medicine.
When they are used as spices, they are sometimes called Pepperoncini. They are then used to make food more spicy. They may be on pizza, for example, in very thin slices.
Chile peppers are completely unrelated to the "Piperaceae" genus, which Black pepper is from.
