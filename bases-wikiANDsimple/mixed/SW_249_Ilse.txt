249 Ilse is a Main belt asteroid. It has an unusually slow rotation period, about 3.5 days.
It was found by C. H. F. Peters on August 16, 1885 in Clinton, New York and was named after Ilse, a legendary German princess.
Due to the long rotation period, a possible moon of Ilse was suggested by R. P. Binzel in 1987. No evidence of it has been provided, however.
