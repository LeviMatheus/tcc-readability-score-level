A pen name is a name an author uses in the place of their real name, when they write and publish things. For example, the BrontÃ« sisters who were famous authors in the 19th century used them, because back then no one would read a book written by a woman. Charles Dodgson, a math professor took the name Lewis Carroll, when he wrote fantasy stories.
