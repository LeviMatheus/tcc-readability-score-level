He was one of the leaders of the third crusade against Saladin. He was stopped many times on his journey to Jerusalem, which never actually succeeded. During his journey, he conquered Sicily and Cyprus. He may have been a homosexual, and was punished for sodomy twice. He fought in the Battle of Acre and the Battle of Arsuf. He was shot with an arrow in the arm. A doctor tried to help him, but the shot became infected. He died as a result. He was considered a very brave and noble king, but he did not spend a lot of time in England. He is buried at Fontevraud Abbey near Saumur in France, as are his father and mother.
