Diagnosis is when a doctor finds out what is making a person sick. The verb is to diagnose. Sometimes doctors can diagnose a disease by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do "tests". Tests can look at blood. Tests can be x-rays. Tests are ways to see how the body is working.
When a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend therapy (treatment).
