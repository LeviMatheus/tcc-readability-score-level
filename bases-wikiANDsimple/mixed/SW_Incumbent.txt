An incumbent is someone who currently holds a political office. This word is usually used when talking about elections, which are often between the incumbent and one other person or several other people. For example, in the 2004 United States presidential election, George W. Bush was the incumbent because he was the president at that time. It can also be used in sports to let you know if a sportsman still holds the position or award in question
