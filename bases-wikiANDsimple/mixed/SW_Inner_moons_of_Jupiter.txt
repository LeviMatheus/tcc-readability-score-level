The inner moons of Jupiter are four small moons that orbit close to Jupiter. These moons are closely interconnected with Jupiter's rings and serve as both sources and sinks of the ring's material. Their semi-major axes range between 128,000 and 222,000 km.
Metis and Adrastea each orbit Jupiter in less than one Jovian day (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate once). Phobos, a moon of Mars, is the only other moon known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day.
