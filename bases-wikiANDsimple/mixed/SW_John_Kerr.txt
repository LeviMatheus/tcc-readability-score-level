Sir John Robert Kerr (24 September 1914 - 24 March 1991) was the 18th Governor-General of Australia. He is famous for dismissing Prime Minister Gough Whitlam in 1975. This is one of the most famous events in Australian history. Even though the Whitlam government was not voted back in after being dismissed, Kerr continued to be disliked by many people.
