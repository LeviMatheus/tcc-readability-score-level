Thule is the name of the island which Pytheas,the ancient Greek explorer, discovered in the fourth century B.C. Pytheas reported that this island was located in the north of Britain. So it is believed that Thule is probably Iceland or the Shetland Islands or the Faroe Islands or the coasts of Norway. Today,a village in the north of Greenland is called Thule which is also called Qaanaaq.
