The official name of Qambar District is Qamber-Shahdad Kot District. This name was chosen by much conflict between the people of Qambar Ali Khan City and Shahdad Kot City in the days of Chief Minister of Sindh Arbab Ghulam Rahim in 2004. This district of Sindh province, Pakistan was originally part of Larkana District. Which was later on divided into two districts. At first its name was Shahdad Kot District but after much protests by Qambar City it was renamed to Qambar Shahdad Kot District.
