159 Aemilia is a big Main belt asteroid. This slowly rotating, dark asteroid is made of carbonates.
It orbits within the Hygiea family, although it may be an unrelated asteroid orbiting within the family, as it is too big to have been formed from the cratering process that most likely formed that family.
Aemilia was found by the brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on January 26, 1876. The credit for finding the asteroid was given to Paul. It is probably named after the Via Aemilia, a Roman road in Italy that runs from Piacenza to Rimini.
Two stellar occultations by Aemilia have been recorded so far, the first in 2001 and the second in 2003.
