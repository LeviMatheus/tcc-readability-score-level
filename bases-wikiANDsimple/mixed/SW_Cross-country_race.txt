A Cross-country race is any running race that takes place on different types of terrain. Different levels of competition include middle school (), high school (), collegiate (men and, women 5km and), amateur, and professional.
The scoring in these events gives one point to the winner, two points to the person who finished second, and so on. In an "invitational" or "meet" where teams of runners count up the points of their top five finishers. This is their score. The team with the lowest score wins. If there is a tie, the team with the fastest sixth man wins.
Times in races depend on the terrain, weather, and the other runners. This means that two athletes competing in different places in the world who are running the same time might not be at the same ability level.
