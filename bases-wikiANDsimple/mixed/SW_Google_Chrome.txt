Google Chrome is an open source web browser developed by Google. It builds on parts from other open source software, including WebKit and Mozilla.
The name comes from the graphical user interface frame, or "chrome", of web browsers. The open source project behind Google Chrome is known as "Chromium."
A beta version for Microsoft Windows was released on 2 September 2008 in 43 languages. Mac OS X and Linux versions are under development and are going to be released after the Windows version.
Announcement.
The release announcement was going to be made on 3 September 2008, and a comic by Scott McCloud was to be sent to journalists and bloggers explaining the features of and reasons for the new browser.

As of September 2, 2008 Google has a link to Google Chrome on their main page.
