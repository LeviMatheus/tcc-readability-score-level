Gravitational energy is the energy held by an object because of its high position compared to a lower position. I.e. Apencil being held above a table has a higher gravitational potential than a pencil sitting on the table. Gravitional potential energy is Mechanical energy minus Kinetic Energy. It has a scalar quantity measured in Joules (J).
Formula.
Force of gravity = formula_1
