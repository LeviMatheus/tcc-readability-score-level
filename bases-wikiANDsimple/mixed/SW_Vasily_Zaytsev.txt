Captain Vasily Grigoryevich Zaytsev (,) (March 23, 1915â€“December 15, 1991) was a Soviet sniper during World War II. He is particularly notable for his activities between November 10 and December 17, 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. He killed 225 soldiers and officers of the Wehrmacht and other Axis armies, including 11 enemy snipers. Before the 10th November, he had already killed 32 Axis soldiers with the standard Mosin-Nagant rifle. Between October 1942 and January 1943, Zaytsev had made 242 verified kills, but the real number may be much higher; some argue it might have been as many as 500. His military rank at the time was Junior Lieutenant.
