Fresh water (also freshwater or fresh-water) is water that does not have a lot of salt in it.
When people say "fresh water", they are most likely talking about water from the lakes, rivers, snow, and ice. It also can mean water that people can drink. Although to drink the water from the snow completely frozen first without a little melted is very bad for you. The oceans and seas are made up of salt water, which people cannot drink. However, people cannot drink all fresh water, because it might not be clean and might have bacteria inside it, which are little living things that can cause diseases. Fresh water that people can drink safely is called potable water.
