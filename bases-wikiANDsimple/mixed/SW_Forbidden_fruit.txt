The words Forbidden fruit stand as a metaphor (an image). The metaphor comes from the book of Genesis in the Bible. There Adam and Eve are thrown out of Paradise because they eat from the tree of knowledge.
Most often, people thought the fruit was an apple. The Bible does not say what kind the fruit is. In Judaism the fruit is believed to be either a grape, a fig, a citron or wheat. Most scholars say that the type of fruit is not forbidden, it was just the fruits of that particular tree that were.
In general, the term can also refer to something that is considered to be illegal or immoral to do. It might also be dangerous. Many times this is about sex (perhaps with children, inside the family, or outside of marriage) or about using illegal drugs. It might also be about people drinking alcohol even though they are too young to be legally allowed to do so.
