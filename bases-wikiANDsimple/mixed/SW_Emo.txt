Emo is a kind of music that is short for "emotional hardcore". The genre first formed in the mid-1980s from hardcore punk. In the mid 1990s, emo was associated with indie rock music. Once it became mainstream in the 2000s, it became influenced by pop-punk music and skatepunk. Cities like Washington, D.C. were the first to develop the emo movement.
Today, emo is more often associated with fashion than with music. Emo (sometimes referred to as "scene") is a teen subculture, though many people use "emo" as an insult. Emo kids are labeled to wear black clothes and have hair dyed black, or naturally colored with streaks or coon-tails, or unnatural-colored with fringe bangs swept to one side. They are also stereotyped to be depressed and quiet. Some emo kids are depressed and do self-injury, such as taking a razor and cutting their arms and punching themselves. Sometimes this is because they feel inadequate, and think they deserve to be in pain.
Emo culture is sometimes confused with goth and scene culture. Goth, scene and emo are similar in some ways, but have many major differences.
One of the founding bands of the emo genre was Rites of Spring.
Present emo bands include The Used, Circle Takes the Square, and Hawthorne Heights. Older emo bands include The Get Up Kids, Sunny Day Real Estate, Gray Matter, Jimmy Eat World and Still Life.
