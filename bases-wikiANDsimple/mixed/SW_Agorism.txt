Agorism is an anarchist political philosophy founded by Samuel Edward Konkin III that believes the ultimate goal as bringing about a society in which all "relations between people are voluntary exchanges a free market." The term comes from the Greek word "agora," referring to an open place for assembly and market in ancient Greek city-states.
