Characteristics.
As in Wikipedia, Vikidia is an open wiki, so everybody is allowed to edit the articles. But Vikidia is also a wiki for children, so all inappropriated or shocking contents are quickly removed by the site's administrators.
Vikidia helps childs to contribute, and some schools and teachers have involved their class to write articles as a school project.
