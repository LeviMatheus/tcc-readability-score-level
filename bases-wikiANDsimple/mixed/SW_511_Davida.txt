511 Davida is a big main belt asteroid. It was found by R. S. Dugan in 1903. It is thought to be the sixth most massive asteroid after Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea, and Interamnia, averaging some 326 km in diameter and taking up an estimated 1.3% of the total mass of the asteroid belt. It is a C-type asteroid, which means that it is dark in colouring and is made of carbonates.
Davida is one of the few main belt asteroids whose shape has been seen by ground-based visual observation. In 2002, astronomers at the Keck Observatory used the Keck II telescope, which is fitted with adaptive optics, to take pictures of Davida. The image showed a stretched object with at least two flat facets. Its rotation period is about 5 hours.
Davida is named after David Peck Todd, an astronomy professor at Amherst College.
