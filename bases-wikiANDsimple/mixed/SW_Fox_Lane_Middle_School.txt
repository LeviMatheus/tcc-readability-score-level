Fox Lane Middle School is a 6th, 7th and 8th grade school in Bedford, New York.
After finishing 5th grade in Bedford Hills Elementary School, Bedford Village Elementary School, Pound Ridge Elementary School, or Mount Kisco Elementary School, most students from those schools go to Fox Lane. After finishing 8th grade at Fox Lane Middle School, most students go to Fox Lane High School.
Fox Lane's mascot is the Fox, and its rival John Jay, a school in Katonah, New York.
Fox Lane is considered interestingly designed because its students are divided into three separate houses, South, East, and West. The houses hold, among other special classes, English, Math, Science, Social Studies, Language, and Learning Centers. Each year, the three houses compete in a competition called "Almost Anything Goes" where students compete in fun events against each other. There is also a Central house, where students go to music and art classes, and where the Main Office is located. There is no North house.
The principal of the school is Mrs. Berardi, and the house directors are Dr. Johnson for South, Mr. Simco for East, and Mrs. Pabon-Evans for West.
