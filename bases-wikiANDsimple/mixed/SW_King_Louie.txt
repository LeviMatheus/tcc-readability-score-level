King Louie is a fictional orangutan who kidnaps Mowgli in Disney's 1967 animated musical adaptation of The Jungle Book. He does not appear in Rudyard Kipling's original book, as orangutans are not native to India. But the movie is "inspired by" rather than "based on" the Kipling stories. King Louie has been called an exampe of a racial stereotype in Disney movies.
