The Golan Heights is a strip of land that was part of Syria until Israel captured it in the Six Day War of 1967. The United Nations has voted to ask Israel to pull its troops out of the Golan Heights. Syria and Israel still have not signed a peace treaty from that war, mostly because of the issue of the Golan. They almost reached a peace deal but they couldn't agree on where to draw the line, and what Syria would have to do in return.
