The flag of Turkey () consists of a white crescent moon and a star on a red background. The flag is called "Ay Yıldız" (literally, moon star) or "Alsancak" (red banner) in Turkish.
The flag has a complex origin since it is an ancient design, and uses the same symbols of the late flag of the Ottoman Empire which was adopted in 1844 with the Tanzimat reforms; though the shape, placement and shade of the color varies. The geometric proportions of the flag were legally standardized with the Turkish Flag Law in 1936. The shade of red used in the flag is approximated by Pantone 186, or RGB (227, 10, 23).
