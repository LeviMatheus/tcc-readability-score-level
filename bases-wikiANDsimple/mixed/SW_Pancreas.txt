The pancreas is an organ that releases hormones and enzymes to help digestion.
It releases substances through special cells called the Islets of Langerhans'".
The pancreas belongs to two systems of function (the digestive system due to its role in breaking down nutrients and the endocrine system for its role in hormone production).
