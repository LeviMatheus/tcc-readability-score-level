Urine is liquid created by the body in the kidneys. Urinating is how the body gets rid of wastes. Urine is the liquid that the waste is put in. Urine is mostly water and salt, and about 2% urea, which is what makes urine a yellow color.
Urine leaves the kidneys and is stored in the bladder. Urine leaves the body through the urethra.
Some slang terms for urine are "pee" and "piss".
