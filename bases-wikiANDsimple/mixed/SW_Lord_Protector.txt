A Lord Protector is a British title for heads of state. It has two different meanings at different times in history.
The title of "Lord Protector" was first used by royal princes or other nobles who ruled while the English monarch was still too young to rule or was not able to rule for some other reason.
The Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland was the title of the head of state during the Interregnum, following the first period of the Commonwealth under Council of State government. It was held by Oliver Cromwell (December 1653–September 1658) and his son Richard Cromwell (September 1658–May 1659) during what is now known as the Protectorate.
