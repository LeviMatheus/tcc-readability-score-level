A mushroom is the fruiting body of a kind of fungus. A toadstool is a poisonous mushroom.
Kinds of mushrooms.
It is hard to pick mushrooms in the wild, because most mushrooms have "look-alikes". Mushroom hunters learn how to tell these look-alikes apart, usually by chemical features. Edible mushrooms are used in cooking in many cultures and are usually grown in farms. In some places in the world, people learn already in childhood to recognize the edible and delicious mushrooms in the wild.
Structure of mushrooms.
Most mushrooms have a stem and a cap. The bottom of the cap sometimes has gills to hold spores, and sometimes holds the spores themselves.
