Rust is a type of corrosion. Rust is the slow breaking of metals, due to air or water touching them. Most all metals rust, but some metals are protected by a thin paint. Metals such as stainless steel, rust much slower then iron. When a piece of metal rusts, it changes to a different color, (ex. iron turns red) and the metal falls apart.
Rust can also be any of various basidiomycete fungi that are parasitic on plants and produce reddish or brownish spots on leaves.
