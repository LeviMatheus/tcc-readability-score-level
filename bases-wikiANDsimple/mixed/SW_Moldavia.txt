Moldavia (Romanian: "Moldova") is a region in South-Eastern Europe. It existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it became one with Wallachia as the basis of the modern Romanian state; at various times, it included the regions of Bessarabia (with the Budjak) and much of Bukovina. The bigger part of Bessarabia is currently the independent state of Moldova, while the rest of it and the northern part of Bukovina are territories of Ukraine.
