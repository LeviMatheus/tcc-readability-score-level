Slave auctions were places where people were sold as slaves to other people. In slave auctions, families were split up and sold to different owners for different amounts of money. Millions of families were split up never to be seen again. Typically the largest slaves were the first to go because they were believed to be able to do more work. However, many women were sold away from little ones and husbands due to a master's need for a good cook and housekeeper.
Many auctions were also meeting places to discuss the war and other important issues at the time.
There were two types of auctions; 'Grab and go' and 'May the highest bidder win.'
Grab and go was where a slave buyer would give the slave trader a certain amount of money and receive a ticket. At the sound of a drum roll, the slave pen (Where the slaves were kept.) would open and the American would rush in and grab the slave or slaves that they wanted. They would then show the ticket to the slave trader before they left.
May the highest bidder win is a lot like online sites like 'Ebay.' You bid the highest amount of money possible and whoever does manage to bid the highest gets to keep the slave.
When Slaves leave the ship, they were taken away and put in a 'pen'. Women, men and families were separated. Any sores or wounds were covered with tar and oil.
Slaves were refered to as cargo, items and women refered to as wencehes. They showed no respect; forcing open their mouths, checking their hair and physique.
They would be given brandy to bring them up and lardonan (Laudanum?) to bring them down. This would make them more desirable to buyers.
