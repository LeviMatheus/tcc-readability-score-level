Modern meaning.
Today a shrine can mean a holy or sacred place with something important inside it, such as the tomb of a religious person.
Shrines are built in the surroundings of grave of pious men. These are built to show respect and love for the one who died. People visit the shrines to pray for themselves and also for the dead.
Shrines are common in Muslim countries. However other countries also have shrines; in Japan, Shinto 'Jinja' are called shrines in English.
