Mammals are a group of vertebrate animals. They form the class "Mammalia".
A mammal is any animal that produces and feeds its young with milk and is warm-blooded; the heat they need to live is made inside their body. The milk is made by glands in the skin or the mammary glands.
There are only five mammals that lay eggs, called Monotremes (for example the platypus). Almost all mammals give birth to living young. Those mammals can be divided into the Marsupials and the
Eutheria, the placental mammals. Marsupials are mammals with pouches to carry young in, like the kangaroo. The Eutheria are all other mammals.
Most mammals have four limbs and a coat of hair, wool or fur.
