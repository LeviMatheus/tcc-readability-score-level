Citric acid is a weak organic acid. It can be found in citrus fruits. It acts like a preservative. It is also used to add a sour (acidic) taste to foods and soft drinks.
Carl Wilhelm Scheele was the first who could extract citric acid from lemons, in 1782. The substance was probably known to alchemists, perhaps with a different name. The Arabian alchemist Geber is said to have discovered citric acid in the 9th century.
