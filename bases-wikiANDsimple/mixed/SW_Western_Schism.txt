The Western schism was a split within the Roman Catholic Church which happened betweeb 1378 and 1417. By its end, three men simultaneously claimed to be the true pope. The reasons for the split were mostly political, rather than theological. The Council of Constance (1414â€“1418) ended the schism when they elected Martin V as the new pope.
