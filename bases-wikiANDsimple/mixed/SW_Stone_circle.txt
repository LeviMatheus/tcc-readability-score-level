A Stone circle is an ancient monument. It is made of several standing stones, usually Menhirs that are arranged in a certain way. Very often those stones form circles or ellipses. The number of stones can vary between four and 60. Very often, burial sites are located in the circle, or nearby.
Most likely stone circles were used for rituals. They might also have been used at calendars; some stone circles are arranged so that certain sotnes are lit on special dates, like the summer solstice.
