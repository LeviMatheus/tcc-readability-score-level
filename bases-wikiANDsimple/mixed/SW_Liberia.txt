The Republic of Liberia is a country in West Africa that has been gravely affected in recent years by two civil wars.
The name of the country is "Land of the Free" in Latin, because it was founded in the early 19th century by freed American slaves. It gained its independence on July 26, 1847.
Liberia is home to more than three and a half million residents. Its capital is Monrovia.
The country's constitution is similar to that of the United States. In the Autumn 2005 elections, Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf became the first female elected head of state in African history. She was inaugurated on January 16, 2006. The President before Johnson-Sirleaf was Gyude Bryant.
For ships, Liberia is a flag of convenience.
