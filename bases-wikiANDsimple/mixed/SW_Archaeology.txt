Archaeology is the study of the past by looking for the remains and relics (historical things) left by the people who lived before us. These are called "artifacts", and can include old coins, tools, buildings and garbage (rubbish). Archaeologists try to work out what these remains mean.
To find these remains, archaeologists often have to dig deep in the ground. This is called fieldwork. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist is based, perhaps a University or museum. Every piece of information is written down or put into a computer, so that a picture can be built up. As settlements (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, what went before is often buried. Ancient Rome, for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeology is expensive and why it takes so long.
Sometimes archaeologists find the bones of dead people and the things they used, or the houses they lived in. Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from.
Archaeologists have many different 'fields of interest', which means they do not all study the same things. Some study Ancient Egypt and are called Egyptologists; others study Ancient Greece, or the Vikings. Archaeologists study every civilization that is known, especially the ones where there is no history to read. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study World War II. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for sunken ships or cities that have been lost under the sea.
Stonehenge, in England is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include Angkor Wat, Machu Picchu, and Great Zimbabwe. In many countries, governments and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.
Sometimes archaeological sites are found when foundations are dug for new buildings. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building are always in a hurry. Quite often as soon as the archaeologists have finished their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are of very great importance.
