Jane Goodall, born in England on April 3rd,1934, is a biologist. She has been interested in animals since childhood. She went to Kenya and met Dr. Louis Leakey there. He thought that she would do a lot of important research, and sent her to Africa. Many people thought she could not live and do research in a dense forest of Africa, because she had no experience or background. Even the UK and Tanzanian governments thought this. But she made many useful discoveries, surprising many people.
One day, she saw a chimpanzee putting a stick in an ant hole to catch white ants. This news, and her name, became famous all over the world. The reason is because before that, scientists had defined a boundary separating human beings from other animals by use of tools. She is a caring person who has a soft spot for monkeys.
