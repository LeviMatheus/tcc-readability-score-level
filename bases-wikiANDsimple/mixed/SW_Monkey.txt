Monkeys are a kind of primate. There are many different kinds of monkeys. Monkeys mostly live in trees. They usually eat bananas, fruits, and leaves. They can be kept as pets. Monkeys can live in forests, and are commonly found in all the rainforests of the world.
A group of monkeys is called a "mission" of monkeys or a "tribe" of monkeys.
Some monkeys are very small, about 15 cm long and 120 g in weight, while other monkeys can be very big, about 1 meter long and 35 kg in weight.
There are two types of monkeys, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys. New World Monkeys live in America and Old World monkeys live in Africa and Asia.

Origin.
The name monkey may have come from a German story called "Reynard the Fox" which was written around 1580. In this story, a character named "Moneke" is the son of "Martin the Ape". The word Moneke may be from the Italian "monna", which means "a female ape."
