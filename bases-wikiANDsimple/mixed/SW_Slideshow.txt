Slideshow means a show of slides. It is a display of several slides for information or for artistic purposes.
Slideshows are conducted by a presenter using an apparatus, such as a slide projector, an overhead projector or in more recent years, a computer running presentation software. The word comes from the use of slides which have been around for many years. Slides originally were projected on movie theater screens by magic lanterns as part of early movie house shows.
The word slideshow does not appear in the "Websterâ€™s New Twentieth Century Unabridged Dictionary" (1973 edition), but is accepted as correct spelling in Microsoft Word in both "Office 2000" and "Office XP" editions.
