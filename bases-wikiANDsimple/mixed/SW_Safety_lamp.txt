A safety lamp is a miner's lamp with a covered flame that used to be used in coal mines.
How it works.
Coal mines are dangerous because of flammable gases like methane that can accumulate. A lamp with a naked (exposed) flame might ignite these flammable gases, causing an explosion, which might kill people. The safety lamp prevents the hot flame of the lamp touching the flammable gasses, reducing the chance of an explosion.
