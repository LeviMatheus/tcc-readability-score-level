A school uniform is a dress people (Usually children) wear when they go to school. In some countries, like the Netherlands, students can wear anything they like when they go to school. In other countries, like England, there is a standard dress code in school. This usually means that there is a set of dressing for girls, and one for boys. The boys and girls need to wear "school uniforms" when they go to school. In many countries, such as the United States, some schools require wearing a uniform, and some do not.
Originally, school uniforms were introduced to hide the social differences between students. Some children do not like uniforms because they do not have a choice in what they must wear.
