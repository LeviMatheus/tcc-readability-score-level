Consecutive integers are integers that follow each other in order. They have a difference of 1 between every two numbers. In a set of consecutive integers, the mean and the median are equal.
If "n" is an integer, then "n", "n"+1, and "n"+2 will be consecutive integers.
-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
Odd Consecutive Integers.
Odd consecutive integers are odd integers that follow each other. They have a difference of 2 between every two numbers.
If "n" is an integer, then 2"n"+1, 2"n"+3, and 2"n"+5 will be odd consecutive integers.
-23, -21, -19, -17, -15, -13, -11
Even Consecutive Integers.
Even consecutive integers are even integers that follow each other. They have a difference of 2 between every two numbers.
If "n" is an integer, then 2"n", 2"n"+2, and 2"n"+4 will be even consecutive integers.
