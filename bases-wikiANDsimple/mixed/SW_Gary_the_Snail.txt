Gary the Snail is a animated fictional character in the Nickelodeon childrens television series "Spongebob Squarepants". The voice for the character is done by Tom Kenny.
Gary is Spongebob's pet snail. There have been several episodes in which Gary turns away from Spongebob. Examples include "Have You Seen This Snail" and "Dumped". It is found out in the episode "Missing Identity" that Gary eats a brand of food called Snail-Po. In the series, Gary always talks like a cat, saying 'Meow'. Apparently Spongebob can undersand Gary's meows and purrs. Gary has actually talked a few times in the series, for example in "Opposite Day", "The Secret Box", and the "Spongebob Squarepants Movie". Gary is Patrick's cousin, as seen in "Rule of Dumb". Even though Gary cannot talk properly, he is shown to be one of the smartest characters in the series, especially in "Sleepy Time".
