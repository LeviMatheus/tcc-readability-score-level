Chorizo is a pork (pig-meat) sausage which people first made in Spain. In it there is fatty pork in large pieces, with chili pepper and paprika. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it.
In the western hemisphere, people know the Mexican and Caribbean sorts better. In these sorts of chorizo, the pork is in much smaller pieces. Different seasonings are also in it with the chili.
People eat chorizo without cooking it, or they fry it in oil. People also use it as a part of other dishes, the same way they eat breakfast sausage. It can also be used in place of ground beef or pork.
