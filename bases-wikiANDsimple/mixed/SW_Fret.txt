Frets are thin metal strips which are used on several stringed musical instruments, such as the guitar, the electric guitar, the bass guitar, the mandolin, and the banjo.
These thin metal strips are mounted on the long necks of these stringed instruments. The frets help the musician playing the instrument to know where to place their fingers on the instrument.
