Postage stamps or just Stamps are pieces of paper with sticky stuff on the back. They are put on envelopes to pay the fee for having the postal service take the envelope where it is being sent. There are a lot of different postage stamps in the world. They have existed since the nineteenth century. Most countries have their own stamps. People collect them in books called stamp albums. Sometimes people collect stamps from only one country, or there is something else that links the stamps. Perhaps the stamps all have mistakes in the printing like in the picture with the aeroplane printed upside down.
