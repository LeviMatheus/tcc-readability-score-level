An Automatic Teller Machine, or ATM for short, is a machine that lets people take out (withdraw) cash from their bank accounts. In the UK ATMs are often called cash machines or the "hole in the wall".
Some Automatic Teller Machines allow people to do more, like put in money, or check how much money there is in a bank account.
ATM's are are found in stores and shopping malls. Sometimes it can be found in a bar or restaurant. Other times, at special events, people may set one up so the guests can use the machine, like at a fundraiser.
People need a debit card or credit card in order to use an ATM. They will also need to have a PIN number to access their account.
There are a number of scams for ATMs. In one scam, con artists look over the victim's shoulder and get their PIN number; this is known as shoulder surfing. In another, they may install a video camera and get PIN numbers from that way. They then make cards using the PIN number and account number to be able to use that person's account.
