Epilepsy is a common chronic neurological condition that is characterised by unprovoked seizures. People with epilepsy are sometimes wrongly called "epileptic". This is wrong because it is the fit or seizure that is "epileptic".
In most cases, epilepsy is caused by scars in the brain. Some forms of the condition are caused by genes, they may be passed on from the parents to the children. Very often, the actual cause for an epileptic seizure is lack of sleep, too much alcohol, or other things that cause stress.
Many countries in the world say there are special rules for people who have epilepsy. They need to be without a seizure for some time before they may drive a car. They also need to take drugs to treat their illness. In many countries, such people may not drive autobuses, taxis or lorries.
