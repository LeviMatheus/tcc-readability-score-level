Paul the Apostle's Epistle to the Romans (16:6) mentions a Mary. She is said to have treated Paul with special kindness, and to have "laboured much among" the early Christian community.
Although it has been conjectured that she is the same person as the Mary, mother of John Mark, this is generally considered to be unproven. Most traditions hold that there is nothing more known about her.
