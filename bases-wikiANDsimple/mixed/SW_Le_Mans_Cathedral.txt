The Cathedral of Le Mans is a Cathedral built in Gothic style. It is dedicaited to Saint Julien; he was the first bishop of Le Mans; he is also buried in the cathedral. It is somewhat unique in the West. It is often compared to those of Reims and Chartres. Its building was influenced a lot by the Cathedral of Bourges.
It is also special because its nave is built in Romanesque style, but the choir is built in Gothic style.
