The 1928 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the IX Olympiad, were held in 1928 in Amsterdam, Netherlands. Amsterdam had made a bid for the 1920 and 1924 Olympic Games, but had to give way to war-victim Belgium and De Coubertin's Paris before finally being awarded with the organisation. The only other candidate city was Los Angeles. Los Angeles would eventually host the Olympics four years later in 1932.
Participating nations.
A total of 46 nations were represented at the Amsterdam Games. Malta, Panama, and Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) competed at the Olympic Games for the first time. Germany returned after having not being invited in 1920 and 1924.
