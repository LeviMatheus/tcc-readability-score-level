Sufism is the mystic path of Islam. Someone who practices Sufism is called a "Sufi", a "Dervish" or a "Fakir".
In Sufism there exist many different orders ("tarikas"), that were founded from the 12th and 13th centuries until today.
The goal in Sufism is to reach God not only in the hereafter, but in this world. To reach this goal, Sufis practice an ascetic lifestyle, and perform "dhikr", a kind of prayer to God. Often they perform it in a congregation, and each Sufi order has its own special kind of "dhikr".
