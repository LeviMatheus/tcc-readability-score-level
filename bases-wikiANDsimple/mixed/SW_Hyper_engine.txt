The hyper engine was a possible aircraft engine model that could produce 1 horsepower per cubic inch of engine displacement. The term hyper engine was used only in the United States, where the Army Air Corps gave people money to make a hyper engine that had an area of 1,300 cubic inches. This happened in the 1930s. They thought that this would better help with streamlining and to help get a better range. Unfortunately, none of these designs ever made it past the production stage.
