History.
The club started as Newton Heath (L&YR) F.C. in 1878. All of the team worked at Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway depot at Newton Heath. After nearly closing in 1902, John Henry Davies took over and changed the club's name to Manchester United. Manchester United made Matt Busby their manager after the Second World War. Matt Busby used the youth team to get new players, and this was very successful. The club won the Football League in 1956 and 1957. The success was stopped by the Munich air disaster in 1958. Eight of the club's players died. It was thought that the club might close, but it didn't, and won the football league in 1965 and 1967, and the European Cup in 1968.
The club did not do well again until the 1990s and 2000s, when Alex Ferguson became manager. He won the club ten league victories in 21 years, most recently in the 2007-08 season. In 1999, Manchester United became the only team to win the UEFA Champions League, FA Premier League and the FA Cup in the same season. The club had been a Public Limited Company since 1991, and an attempted takeover by Rupert Murdoch had been blocked by the British Government in 1999, but in 2005 Malcolm Glazer completed a hostile takeover of the club. When this happened fans formed FC United of Manchester. When Manchester United sold star player David Beckham in 2003, they began to search for a player to take his place, and the team convinced Sir Alex Ferguson to buy Cristiano Ronaldo.
