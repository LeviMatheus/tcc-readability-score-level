An equation is a mathematical or chemical object.
Usually mathematical equations have one equals sign (=) with two terms on each side of it. The equals sign says that the terms on each side of it must be exactly equal.
The second kind is often used to solve problems in which you have to know the value of some variables.
Equations are a part of math called algebra.
