A matchbook is a small cardboard container that holds a quantity of matches inside and has a coarse striking surface on the exterior.
A flap on the front is lifted to access the matches, which are attached to the interior base in a comb-like pattern and must be torn away before use. (In the matchbox, by contrast, the matches are arranged loosely in the interior tray.)
Matchbooks are often covered with advertising logos or various artistic decorations, and they have served as collector's items and free souvenirs.
