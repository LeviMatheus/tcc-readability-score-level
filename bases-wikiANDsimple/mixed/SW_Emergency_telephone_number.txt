An emergency telephone number is a telephone number that can be used to quickly contact emergency services for assistance. Many countries' public telephone networks have a single emergency telephone number, sometimes known as the universal emergency telephone number or the emergency services number. Most emergency service numbers are three digits long so that they can be dialled quickly and remembered easily. Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services, but they are often different only by the last digit.
