Ye (in Russian and Belarusian) or E (in Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Ukrainian) (Е, е) is the sixth letter of the Cyrillic alphabet. It sounds like [e] or [ɛ], except in Russian and Belarusian, where it is palatised and said as [je] or soft [e].
It came from the Greek epsilon and is the same as the Roman E.
