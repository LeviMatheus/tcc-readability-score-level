A person's rights are what they can do or have legally or morally.
In the United States, some legal rights are listed in the Bill of Rights
'I have a right to "x generally means that someone else has an obligation to provide me with "x" or not to stop me from having "x".
Not all thinkers believe in moral rights. For example, Jeremy Bentham described them as 'nonsense upon stilts'
