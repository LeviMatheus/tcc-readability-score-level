Lojban is an Engineered language that some people speak. It is an unusual language because there is no country where everyone speaks Lojban. People from all countries learn and speak Lojban only if they want to. A person who speaks lojban is called a lojbanist. It was first made up by a man called James Cooke Brown in 1955, but the Lojban that people speak now is from a book written by a man called John Cowan in 1997.
Lojban is a language that was made after looking at how people speak. It works with how people think to, to try to make a language that makes it easy to understand what people say.
Lojban came from the language "Loglan", another engineered language.
Examples.
"mi'e" is used when you are saying your real name. Because there is no country where everyone speaks Lojban, nobody is born with a name in lojban. But, some Lojbanists make up lojban names for themselves that they use. Because they know most other people do not speak lojban, they usually keep their real name as well, and only use their lojban name when speaking to other lojbanists. If someone is telling you their lojban name, they usually say "mi'o mi'e" (sounds like "miho mihay"), which means "Only for us, my name is..".
"go'i" means "yes, I agree with you". Sometimes in English, the word yes is used to mean other things. For example, you might say "Yes" (or "OK" or "uh-huh") to tell someone that you heard what they are saying. In Lojban you do not say "go'i" for this; instead you say "je'e" (sounds like "jayhay"). This is part of the idea of lojban: to make words easier to understand by making sure that one word can only mean one thing.
