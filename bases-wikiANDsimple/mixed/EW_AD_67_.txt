AD 67 (LXVII) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Julius Rufus and Fonteius Capito (or, less frequently, year 820 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination AD 67 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
