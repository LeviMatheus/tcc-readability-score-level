A scarf is a piece of fabric worn on or near the head or around the neck for warmth, cleanliness, fashion or for religious reasons. Neck scarves are usually knitted or crocheted, while headscarves are usually woven.
Many Muslim women wear a headscarf known as a hijab. In the Persian Gulf Region it is called a sheila.
