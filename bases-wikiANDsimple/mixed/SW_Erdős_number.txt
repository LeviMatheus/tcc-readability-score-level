The Erdős number () honors the Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős. Erdős was one of the most prolific mathematical writers.
Paul Erdős's number is 0. Anyone who directly worked with Paul Erdős has an Erdős number of 1. Anyone who works with those collaborators who have a Erdős number of 1, have an Erdős number of 2. The chain continues like that.
