Software engineering is designing and writing programs for computers. A software engineer is often someone who has trained to do this at a college or university. Software engineering is very difficult work. Most often it is done by a team of people. It often takes the team a long time to make the programs that they are asked to write.
Software engineering is also a part of computer science where people learn about ways to make sure programs are well designed and efficient, and learn good ways of making programs so that they are easily maintainable in the future. A program that is not efficient is often limited in what it can do.
