Experience points are numbers used in role-playing games to determine whether to make the character more powerful and enhance the magic power of the character(s) that the player is pretending to be. In massively multiplayer role playing games, gaining more experience points increased the amount of weapons and armor that the player can use in a role playing session. The more points a player has, the stronger he is. Eventually, at level 99 (in most role playing games), the player becomes a half god and can defeat almost any monster in the video game.
