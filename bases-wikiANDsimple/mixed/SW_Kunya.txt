A kunya (Arabic:كنية) is a name which is honorably given to the mother or father an Arabic child. Kunya is pronounced koon-ya. A married person (especially ladies) are called by their kunya name, which is "abu" (father) or "umm" (mother) plus the name of their first son. Their whole name is their name plus their kunya. For example, "Umm Ja'far Aminah" is the mother of Ja'far. The kunya precedes the personal name.
