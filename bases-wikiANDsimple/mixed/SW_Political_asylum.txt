Someone may ask for a political asylum when it is frightened to live in his own country. He then will go to another country. If he is allowed to live in the new country this is called "political asylum".
The political asylum is one of the human rights, and a rules of international law. All countries who have agreed to the "United Nations Conventions Relating to the Status of Refugees" must let people, who do qualify, come into their country.
People who are given political asylum are called refugees. They are often confused with "economic refugees". Economic refugees are people who move from a poor country to a richer one so that they may work and make more money, often to send back to their families. Economic refugees are often an easy target for some politicians and newspapers who say that economic refugees take jobs from people who live in the host country. These politicians and newspapers do not show that there is a difference between economic refugees, who "want" live in another country to make money, and political refugees who "must" live in another country to be safer.
