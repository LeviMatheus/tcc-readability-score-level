Black tea is a kind of tea. Often, it is stronger in taste than the other varieties of tea, like green tea. It also contains more caffeine. In some parts of the world, such as China, it is called "Red tea". This is probably a better description of the colour of the drink. Because it can be kept longer, it has been traded a lot. It is generally the preferred form of tea in the West.
