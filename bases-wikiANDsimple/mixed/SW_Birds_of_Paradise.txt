The birds of paradise are members of the family Paradisaeidae of the order Passeriformes. They are found in eastern Indonesia, Torres Strait Islands, Papua New Guinea, and eastern Australia. Best known are the members of the genus "Paradisaea", including the type species, the Greater Bird of Paradise, "Paradisaea apoda".
They live in tropical forests like rainforests, swamps and moss forest and build their nests from soft materials, such as leaves, ferns, and vine tendrils, typically placed in a tree fork.
What they look like.
Birds of paradise range in size from the King Bird of Paradise at 50 grams (1.8 oz) and 15 cm (6 in) to the Black Sicklebill at 110 cm (43 in) and the Curl-crested Manucode at 430 grams (15.2 oz).
Birds of paradise have bodies that look like a crow. They have stout or long bills and strong feet, with around two-thirds of the species being strongly sexually dimorphic.
What they eat.
In most species, the diet is mostly fruit, but riflebirds and sicklebills also prefer insects and other arthropods.
