The Jurassic Coast is a special bit of coastline that is between Orcombe Point near Exmouth in East Devon to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in East Dorset. This is on the south coast of England. It is 95 miles or 153 kilometres long. It is particularly special because it is a World Heritage Site, these are made by UNESCO.
Geology.
The Jurassic Coast is made of Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous cliffs, spanning 180 million years of geological history.
The site contains a number of special features and shows different landforms, including the natural arch at Durdle Door, the cove and limestone folding at Lulworth Cove and an island, the Isle of Portland. Chesil Beach is a example of both a tombolo and a storm beach. The site has concordant and discordant coastlines. Because the Jurassic Coast is so special, the site is being looked at as an International Study. This area was home to Mary Anning, a palaeontologist who looked at the fossils of the coastline around Lyme Regis and discovered the first complete Ichthyosaur fossil. One place called Golden Cap is special because it is the highest place on all the south coast of England. It is high.
