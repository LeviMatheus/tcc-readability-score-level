The Dodo is an extinct species of bird. Dodos could not fly. The dodo is closely related to the Pigeon. It used to live on the island of Mauritius before it became extinct. The dodo is one of the first species that was made extinct by humans. The dodo has been extinct since the mid-to-late 17th century. It is commonly used as the main example of an extinct species because its extinction occurred during recorded human history, and was directly caused by human activity.
