The Monterey International Pop Music Festival took place from June 16 to June 18, 1967. Over 200,000 people went, and it is often seen as the beginning of the "rock era", displacing the earlier term "rock and roll". The festival was a cultural watershed. Many of the performers (like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin) became major celebrities through their appearances, while older acts (like The Beach Boys, who were scheduled to appear but cancelled) were suddenly seen as obsolete.
