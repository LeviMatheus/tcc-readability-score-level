"My Gym Partner's a Monkey" is a show on Cartoon Network. It is about a boy named Adam Lyon who used to go to a normal human school but the principal says he is an animal because he spelled "Lyon" with an "i". He then goes to Charles Darwin Middle School (a spoof on the scientist Charles Darwin) and he makes friends with the animals at the school.
