A mask is a type of clothing that someone can use to hide their face.
Uses.
There are many reasons why people use masks. A person can use masks to make it so that others do not know who they are (like when a robber steals from a bank) or use it to keep someones face safe from harm (like a gas mask to make it so that harmful gases do not get into your body).
Origin.
The word "mask" might have came from other languages. "Mask" might have came from the French word "masque", the Italian word "maschera", the Spanish word "m√°scara", the Latin (not classical) word "mascus/masca (meaning "ghost")" or the Arabic word "maskharah (meaning "jester" or "man in masquerade")".
