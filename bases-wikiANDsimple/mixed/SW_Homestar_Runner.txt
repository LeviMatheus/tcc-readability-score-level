Video games.
Tell Tale Games, the makers of video games based on the Sam & Max comic book, made a game called "Strong Bad's Cool Game for Attractive People" for Windows and the Wii's WiiWare. It's an episodic game with five episodes, and it's 3D instead of 2D like Homestar Runner is. The first episode was called "Homestar Ruiner", and another episode will be out in September called "Strongbadia the Free". There will be a new episode every month until December.
