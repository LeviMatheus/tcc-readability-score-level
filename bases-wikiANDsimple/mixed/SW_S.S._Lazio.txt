S.S. Lazio is an Italian football club based in Rome. They play in light blue shirts, white shorts and socks. The name Lazio was chosen as the original founders wanted to name the club after something which was greater and encompassed more than just the city that they were from - Lazio is the name of the region in which Rome is located. The sky blue and white team colors were inspired by the Greek flag and more specifically the country which gave birth to Olympic tradition; the eagle as an acknowledgement by its founders to the symbol of the Roman Empire. SS Lazio is the oldest active football club in Rome, and is at present one of the biggest clubs in Europe.
