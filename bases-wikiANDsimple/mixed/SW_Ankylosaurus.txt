The Ankylosaurus ("Ankylosaurus magniventris") was a type of dinosaur.
Its back was covered in spikes and bits of bone to protect its self. Underneath it was not covered in anything but normal skin, so other dinosaurs, like T-Rex, would try to attack it there. It would defend its self by using its clubbed tail.
Ankylosaurus was a herbivore. This means it eat plants. Beacause there was no grass in dinosaur times, Ankylosaurus probably ate ferns and low shrubs.
