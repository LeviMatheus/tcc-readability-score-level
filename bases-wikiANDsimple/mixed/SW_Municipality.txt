A municipality is a word used for a city, a town or a village, or a small group of them. It has a clearly defined territory, and all the people living on that territory share one common administration.
In most countries, a municipality is the smallest administrative subdivision to have its own democratically elected representative leadership. A municipality is usually governed by a mayor and a city or municipal council.
In some countries, municipalities are referred to as "communes" (for example, French "commune", Italian "comune" or Swedish "kommun").
