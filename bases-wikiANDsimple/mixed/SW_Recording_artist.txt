A recording artist is a singer or musician who is known for making musical recordings.
Many recording artists are also stage performers, but a few work only in a recording studio. This may be because they dislike touring or giving live appearances, or because they prefer studio work or need to stay close to home.
Recording artists are usually paid royalties from sales of their recordings. They will get a percentage of the money their record label receives when people buy their recordings. This percentage may be as low as 1/2%, though rates can become much higher. Some artists are only paid for session work, or by the number of recordings they make.
The Beatles remain the world's most successful recording artists, nearly forty years since they broke up in 1970. Their record sales are well over one billion. Michael Jackson is the world's most successful solo recording artist, with worldwide sales of over 750 million records according to the 2007 "Guinness Book of World Records".
Other artists who have achieved sales records or milestones include The Eagles (whose "Greatest Hits" album became the world's biggest-selling record in the 1990s), Bing Crosby (whose "White Christmas" sold the most copies of any single, until Elton John's "Candle in the Wind" outsold it in the late 1990s), and Pink Floyd (their "Dark Side of the Moon" stayed on the "Billboard" sales charts for more than ten years).
