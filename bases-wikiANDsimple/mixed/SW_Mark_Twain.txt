Mark Twain is the pen name of Samuel Langhorne Clemens (November 30, 1835 - April 21, 1910), a well known and well liked American writer born in Florida, Missouri. He worked mainly for newspapers and as a riverboat pilot before he became a writer.
Clemens was best known for his works in fiction (made-up writing), and especially for his use of humour. His first published story, in 1867, was "The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County."
"Huckleberry Finn" has become very respected, considered by many to be Clemens' best work. This story of a white boy who helps a black man escape slavery in the southern United States is known for its humanity.
