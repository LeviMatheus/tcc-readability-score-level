Irish or "Gaeilge" is a language spoken in Ireland. Irish is a Celtic language. This means that Irish is similar to Scottish Gaelic and Welsh. Many people who speak Irish can understand some Scottish Gaelic. They usually do not understand Welsh though.
Until the nineteenth century, most people in Ireland spoke Irish. There were great poets who wrote in Irish. Their poems became the songs of the people. People told stories about the heroes of old times. Many of the poems were about them.
Today, Irish is the first official language of the Republic of Ireland. It is not spoken by most Irish people outside the Gaeltacht for day to day life, but a lot of people speak it daily also or when among friends or family. It has to be taught in all schools in Ireland.
The newest Gaeltacht in Ireland is on the Falls Road in Belfast City where the whole community has been making Irish their first language for several years. This area is called the Gaeltacht Quarter.
Figures.
There are around 1.5 million speakers. The places where Irish spoken a lot are called Gaeltacht areas or, in Irish, "Gaeltachta√≠". Around 70% of the people in these areas can speak Irish.
