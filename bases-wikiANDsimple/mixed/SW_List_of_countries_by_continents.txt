Several terms are in use to describe the region comprising Australia and the nations of the Pacific Ocean. The term "Oceania" is usually preferred, and this is the term in use by the United Nations. The term "Pacific Islands" generally excludes the islands of New Zealand, and the continent of Australia. The indigenous MƒÅori of New Zealand are a Polynesian people.
Historically the region was called Australasia, although this often meant just Australia, New Zealand and sometimes Papua New Guinea. The term gives special emphasis to Australia and is falling out of favour.
