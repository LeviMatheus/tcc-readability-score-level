A threat is a declaration of intention to inflict punishment or harm on another. It will often be conditional upon a particular course of action on the part of the recipient.
The threat can have a form of an explicit or implicit message.
It can also be any source of probable impending danger (e.g. "a terrorist threat"), or a warning of an impending danger.
