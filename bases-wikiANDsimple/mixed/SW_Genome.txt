In biology the genome of an organism is its whole hereditary information and is encoded in the DNA (or, for some viruses, RNA). This includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the
The term was coined in 1920.
More precisely, the genome of an organism is a complete DNA sequence of one set of chromosomes. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean the complete set of "nuclear DNA" (i.e., the "nuclear genome") but can also be applied to organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the mitochondrial genome or the chloroplast genome.
Comparison of different genome sizes.
"Note:" The DNA from a single human cell has a length of ~1.8 m (but at a width of ~2.4 nanometers).
