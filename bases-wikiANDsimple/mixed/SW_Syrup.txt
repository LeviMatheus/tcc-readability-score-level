Syrup is a thick, sweet, flavored liquid with a great deal of sugar in it. There are different flavored syrups, such as chocolate syrup, vanilla syrup, and maple syrup. Syrups are used to sweeten and flavor hot and cold drinks, and they are poured on desserts and breakfast foods.
Used in drinks.
Syrups are used in many different types of drinks. Coffee shops add chocolate syrup and other flavored syrups (for example: vanilla) to coffee drinks. Ice cream parlors add chocolate syrup to milk shakes. In Italy, cafés often offer a choice of different syrups that can be added to carbonated soda water, to add sweetness and flavor.
Used for desserts.
Syrups are also used in many desserts. Ice cream parlors pour chocolate syrup on bowls of ice cream. Cafés and restaurants pour syrup on cakes, pies, crepes, and pancakes. Maple syrup is often poured on pancakes in North America during the breakfast meal. Maple syrup is made from the sap from maple trees that is boiled until it thickens.
During the warm months, stores in North America sell desserts called "slushies" or "slush puppies" that consist of crushed ice in a cup that has flavored syrup poured in it.
