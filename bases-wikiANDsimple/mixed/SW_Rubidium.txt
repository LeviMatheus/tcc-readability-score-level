Rubidium is chemical element 37 on the periodic table. Its symbol is Rb.
Rubidium is part of the group of elements known as the alkali metals. It is a very soft metal and if you heated it up, it would melt at a low temperature. This is unusual. Rubidium is also very reactive. It will explode in air because it reacts with many other elements in the air like oxygen and nitrogen. There is not much rubidium on the earth, so it can cost a lot of money to get it. There are not many uses for rubidium.
Rubidium is not very dangerous in the human body; however, if a person gets too much from eating, they could get sick because it acts like other alkali metals such as potassium and sodium.
