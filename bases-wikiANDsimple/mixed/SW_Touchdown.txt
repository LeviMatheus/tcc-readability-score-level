A touchdown is a common way of scoring in American and Canadian football. A team gets a touchdown by the person with the ball running across the line of the goal, or catching the ball while past the line of the goal. In American and Canadian football, a touchdown gives the team 6 points. The team also gets a chance to score 1 or 2 more points in what is called an extra point.
