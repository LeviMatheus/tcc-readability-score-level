Virginity means a state of purity or inexperience. Traditionally a virgin is a person that did not have sexual intercourse. Usually, the idea of virginity is used for women, but is also used for men who haven't had sexual intercourse sometimes.
Virginity has different meanings and importance in different religions and cultures.
In several polytheistic religions (religions with many gods), priestesses of certain gods have to be virgins. In many cultures it is said that women should be virgins until marriage. In some cultures, women who are not virgins until marriage are hit or killed.
Virgin women usually have a hymen. It is a thing that blocks the vagina. If a man's penis or other object goes inside the vagina, it usually tears the hymen. This causes bleeding. This blood from the hymen is important in many cultures. It is a sign that woman was really a virgin. In Islamic countries they show this blood to the relatives of bride and spouse after the wedding night so that they believe that the woman was a virgin before getting married. However, whether a woman has a hymen or not does not really indicate whether or not she is a virgin. A hymen can be broken by riding a horse or playing sports, but this does not mean the woman is not a virgin.
It is possible for a virgin to have a sexually transmitted disease, which was acquired by some other means: such as drug use, blood or plasma transfusions, close skin contact in the pubic area with infected people, oral sex, and other means.
