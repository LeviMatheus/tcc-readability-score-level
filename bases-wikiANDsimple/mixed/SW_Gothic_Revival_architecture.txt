Gothic Revival architecture is architecture that has been made to look as if it is from Medieval times, but is really much newer. The Gothic style of archicture was built in Europe between 1140 and about 1550. Beginning in the late 18th cenntury (1700s), through the 19th century and into the early 20th century (1900s), there was a fashion to build in the Gothic style. This is called "Gothic Revival". The types of buildings that are generally built in the Gothic Revival style are churches, cathedrals, universities, town halls and sometimes houses.
