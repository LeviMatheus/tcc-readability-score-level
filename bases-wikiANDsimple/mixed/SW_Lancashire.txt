Lancashire is a county in the North West of England. Its two cities are Lancaster and Preston. Before 1974, Liverpool and Manchester were part of Lancashire.
The county has developed a fierce rivalry with Yorkshire, the next county east. This has grown out of rivalry in sport, such as in cricket, and comes from the War of the Roses.
A main attraction in Lancashire is Blackpool, a typical English seaside resort, boasting a theme park (Blackpool Pleasure Beach).
It has the second largest rollercoaster in Europe ("The Big One") and a tower modelled after the Eiffel Tower, Blackpool Tower.
Lancashire is characterised by its market towns (such as Chorley) and small villages (Bretherton, Croston, Eccleston etc). Situated just south of an area of outstanding natural beauty, the Lake District, Lancashire also has its fair share of pleasant countryside such as White Coppice and the Rivington Moors. Lancashire's urban heart can be seen in the newly acclaimed City of Preston, an ex mill town, which has a variety of shops, restaurants, bars and historical architecture.
Another hallmark of Lancashire is the acclaimed "Lancashire Hot pot" consisting of meat, onion or various vegetables and potatoes. It is commonly found on many pub menus throughout the county and Britain itself.
The people of Lancashire are generally renowned for their friendly nature. Humour is also a vital element of Lancashire life and Lancastrians pride themselves on having their own "brand" of humour.
