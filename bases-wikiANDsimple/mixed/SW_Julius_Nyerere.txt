Julius Kambarage Nyerere (April 13 1922 - October 14 1999), also known as Mwalimu (teacher), was President of Tanzania from 1964 to 1985, though he was still influential in politics until his death in 1999 because of his popularity. He is remembered as an unusually honest leader, especially for Africa, and for helping refugees. When his attempt at using his socialist ideas of Ujamaa failed, he said, "I failed. Let's admit it." He was also responsible for the overthrow of the murderous Idi Amin regime in Uganda.
