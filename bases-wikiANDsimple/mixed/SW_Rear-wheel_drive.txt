Rear-wheel drive, or RWD, is when a car uses its rear wheels to move. This is good for dry roads, and for acceleration, or how fast you move forward, as the weight is pushed backwards on the back wheels. But, RWD cars can spin out, also called oversteer or fishtail. This can cause crashes if the driver is new and not familiar with RWD cars.
