Monkey Island is a well-known adventure game series made and published by LucasArts.
The games are known for their humor, and often use parody and clich√©s, both from pirate stories as well as from films.
The story takes place in the Caribbean. In the different games the main character Guybrush Threepwood, who wants to become a pirate, has many adventures. Each of the games usually involves the evil undead pirate LeChuck and the island which gave the series its name.
