Breakdance (also called breaking, b-boying or b-girling) is a type of dance that is done by people who are part of the hip hop culture. Breakdancing was invented in the early 1970s in African-American and Puerto Rican communities in South Bronx in New York City. The dance style evolved during the 70s and 80s in big cities of the United States.
Breakdancing uses different body movements, spins, arm movements, leg movements, all of which are done to the rhythm of hip hop music. Breakdancing was most popular in the 1980s but continues to be common today.
Young people usually breakdance, and it is seen upon as cool.
