Led Zeppelin were an English hard rock and heavy metal band. The group was started in 1968 and ended in 1980. The lineup was Robert Plant (vocals), Jimmy Page (lead guitar), John Paul Jones (bass), and John Bonham (drums). They broke up in 1980 following the accidental death of John Bonham. The band decided not to continue after his death out of respect and because they believed that nobody could take his place. The band played together again in a tribute concert in London on December 10, 2007 with Jason Bonham, John's son playing on the drums.
The band are one of the most influential rock bands of all time and one of the most successful artists in history, selling 300 million albums around the world.
