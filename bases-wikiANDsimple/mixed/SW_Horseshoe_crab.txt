Horseshoe crab ("Limulus polyphemus") are benthic or bottom-dwelling organisms found in both estuarine and continental shelf habitats. Horseshoe crabs are arthropods, part of the largest group of all living animals that includes insects, spiders, scorpions and crabs. Unlike true crabs, horseshoe crabs have book gills (a breathing organ in many arachnids containing folds of membrane like leaves of a book), chelicera (an anterior pair of appendages in arachnids, often specialized as fangs) and five pairs of legs. The external appearance of the horseshoe crab has remained relatively unchanged over the last 360 million years ago.
The horseshoe crab population ranges from the Yucatan peninsula to northern Maine, but they are most commonly found in the mid-Atlantic region between Virginia and New Jersey. Each major estuary along the coast is believed to have a discrete horseshoe crab population, distinguished from one another by individualsâ€™ adult size, carapace color and eye pigmentation.
