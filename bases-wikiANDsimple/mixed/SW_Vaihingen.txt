History.
Vaihingen is an old city, going back as far as the year 799 a.d.. Vaihingen was formally established as a town by Count Gottfried von Vaihingen in the year 1252. After theReformation, Vaihingen became a Protestant city. During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), Vaihingen became a battle ground between the Protestants and Catholics. The Revolution of 1848 hurt the economy in Vaihingen. Many people left Vaihingen to look for work in other towns. In the early 1900's, a railroad connection was made to Vaihingen. That brought more people, and also businesses, to Vaihingen. In 1938 Vaihingen became the regional center.
