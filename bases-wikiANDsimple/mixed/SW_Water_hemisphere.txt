The water hemisphere is the hemisphere on the Earth with the highest area of water. It is centered on, near New Zealand. The other half of the Earth is the land hemisphere.
The water hemisphere has only one-eighth of the world's land. Australia, New Zealand, Antarctica, a small part of Southeast Asia and the southern part of South America are in the water hemisphere. Most of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are on the water hemisphere. The area of the oceans of the water hemisphere is much higher than its land area, but the area of the oceans of the land hemisphere is still higher than its land area.
