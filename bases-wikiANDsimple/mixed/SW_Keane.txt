Keane are a modern rock band. They started in East Sussex in England. They are famous for using pianos and their little use of guitars in their music. They listen to artists like The Beatles, U2 and Oasis.
Tim Rice-Oxley and Dom Scott composed the songs that the band played from 1997 to 2001. When Dom left in 2001, Tim composed all the future songs.
Beginning (1995 - 2003).
Pianist Tim Rice-Oxley and singer Tom Chaplin were friends since they were kids. Rice-Oxley's brother was born on the same day and hospital in 1979.
They studied at Vinehall School and later at Tonbridge School. There, they met the other member of the band, Richard Hughes.
Tim made the band in 1995 with his friend Dominic Scott. They named the band "The Lotus Eaters". They changed their name to "Cherry Keane" in 1997, when Chaplin entered the band. Cherry Keane was a lady who served tea at Tim and Tom's school. The name changed again to "Keane". In an interview on 2006, Rice-Oxley said that the band was called Coldplay, but he gave this name to a friend (Chris Martin, of Coldplay).
Keane began playing songs by other artists, but soon they wanted to play their own songs.
Their first live performance (gig) was in 1998, at the "Hope & Anchor" pub (bar) in England.
They made 2 CDs and sold at the pubs where they played. Scott left the band in 2001. Tim wrote "Everybody's Changing" for this.
In December 2002, Simon Williams of Fierce Panda went to a Keane gig in and he offered to make the band's next and first commercial single (song), "Everybody's Changing".
The single was released on 2003.
Hopes and Fears (2003 - 2006).
After another single, in 2004, Island Records invited Keane to make a single with them. "Everybody's Changing" was made after "Somewhere Only We Know". An album was released in May and called "Hopes And Fears". The album was very successful and it was the second best-seller album of the year.
The album sold five million (5,000,000) copies. In 2006, they competed for a Grammy but they lost.
Under the Iron Sea (2006 - 2007).
Keane began recording their second album, "Under the Iron Sea", in 2005, with producer Andy Green.
The first two singles from the album were "Atlantic" and "Is It Any Wonder?". Now, the album has sold one million (2,000,000) copies in the world.
