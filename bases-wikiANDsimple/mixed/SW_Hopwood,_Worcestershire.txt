Hopwood is the name of a small settlement located in Worcestershire, England, south of Birmingham.
Hopwood was established due to the Worcestershire and Birmingham Canal, which runs through the area. Due to this canal the settlement developed around the "Hopwood Inn", which would be a stopping point for anyone using the canal.
Today, the most notable feature of Hopwood is the "Hopwood Park services", which is a motorway service station, on the M42 motorway.
