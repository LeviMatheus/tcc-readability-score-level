The Dead Sea is a lake lying between the countries of Israel and Jordan. At 418 m (1,371 ft) below sea level, it is the lowest point on the surface of the Earth. It is almost nine times as salty as the ocean
The Dead Sea is very salty, which makes it impossible for most life to exist in it. This is the reason for its name. However, it is not completely dead, as some types of bacteria are able to live in the water.
Because the water is so salty, it weighs more than fresh water, and a person is able to easily float in the Dead Sea without any effort. Tourists come from around the world to float in the water.
