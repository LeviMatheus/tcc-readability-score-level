Oxford is a town of history. It is a city in England on the River Thames. It is a very old city, with the oldest buildings being from before the 12th century.
Oxford has two universities, the University of Oxford which is oldest university in an English speaking country, and 'Oxford Brookes' which is a lot younger.
Oxford is filled with history and culture from a time before we lived with its wonderful museums, universities and lots of old sightseeings. A trip to Oxford is very interesting.
