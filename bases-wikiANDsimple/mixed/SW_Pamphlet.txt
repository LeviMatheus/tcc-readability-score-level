It can also be made up of a few pages that are folded in half and stapled at the crease to make a simple book. In order to count as a pamphlet, UNESCO requires the pamphlet to have 'at least 5 but not more than 48 pages' not including the cover page; a longer item is a book.
Pamphlets can contain anything, it may include information on kitchen appliances, instructions as well as religious and political ideas. Pamphlets have been very important in history, publishing a lot of pamphlets can help spread ideas, for instance during the Russian Revolution pamphlets were used to influence people.
