Adultery is a word used in religious texts and in laws. It applies to a married couple, and in the past meant that the man of the couple left his wife for another woman, usually to have sexual intercourse with that woman that is not his wife. Adultery usually comes with a heavy punishment (death by stoning). In most countries adultery is no longer a crime, but most people still see it as a bad thing. If a person who is married takes part in adultery, that person's husband or wife would usually have the right to be able to go to court to divorce that person.
