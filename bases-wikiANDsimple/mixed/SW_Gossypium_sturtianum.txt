Gossypium sturtianum, commonly called "Sturt's Desert Rose", is the floral emblem of the Northern Territory. It was named after explorer Charles Sturt who found the plant in creeks near the site of Broken Hill, New South Wales in 1844. He collected the seeds and brought them back for Robert Brown (1773-1858), a Scottish botanist, to study.
A stylized drawing of the flower is used on the Northern Territory's flag.
