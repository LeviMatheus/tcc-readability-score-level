Tariq Said Ramadan (born 26 September 1962 in Geneva, Switzerland) is a Swiss Muslim academic and theologian. He thinks islamic texts should be studied. He also thinks that Islamic society today is different from what it was when the Koran was written. He therefore says that Muslims living in Euorpe need to adapt and change Islam, so they can contribute its values to a European society.
This position is often refered to as Euroislam.
