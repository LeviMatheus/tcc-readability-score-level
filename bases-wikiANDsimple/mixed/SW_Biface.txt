In archaeology, a biface is a two-sided stone tool, made through a process of lithic reduction, that shows flake scars on both sides. A view from the side of the final product tends to exhibit a lenticular shape (i.e., as a convex lens). Bifacial artifacts can be made on large flakes or blocks, and may be grouped into many distinct classes. For
Biface technology is almost unknown in Australian prehistory.
