The British Rail Class 201 (or 6S) six-car diesel-electric multiple units (DEMUs) were built in 1957-1958 at Eastleigh and Ashford. They were built for use on the London-Hastings line. Several tunnels along the route had restricted clearance, meaning that these units were built with a narrow body profile.
