Transport infrastructure in Guinea-Bissau is basic, with most roads outside the capital Bissau being unpaved. 
Railways.
There are no railways in Guinea-Bissau. At the Port of Bissau, there was a small cargo railway working from the late 19th century into the 1940s.
In 1998 an agreement was signed between Portugal and Guinea-Bissau for construction of a railway to Guinea, but the outbreak of the Guinea-Bissau Civil War in 1998 made these plans impossible.
Roads.
The Transâ€“West African Coastal Highway crosses Guinea-Bissau, connecting it to Banjul (the Gambia), Conakry (Guinea), and eventually to 11 other nations of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
Waterways.
Several rivers are accessible to coastal shipping in Guinea-Bissau.
Seaports and harbours.
Merchant Marine.
In 1999 no merchant vessels were operating.
Airports.
The main airport serving the country, and the only one with scheduled commercial service, is Osvaldo Vieira International Airport in Bissau.
