Andrzej Tadeusz Bonawentura Kościuszko (; 1746 – 1817) was a Polish and Belarussian national hero, general and a leader of the Kościuszko Uprising (which bears his name) against the Russian Empire. He fought in the American Revolutionary War as a colonel in the Continental Army on the side of Washington. In recognition of his dedicated and faithful service he was brevetted by the Continental Congress to the rank of Brigadier General in 1783, and became a naturalized citizen of the United States that same year.
