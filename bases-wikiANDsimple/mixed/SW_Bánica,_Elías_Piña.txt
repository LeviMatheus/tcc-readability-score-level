The Dominican city of San Francisco de Bánica, or simply Bánica, is a municipality of the Elías Piña province, on the border with Haiti and near the Artibonite. The name Bánica comes from the Taíno name of the region, Banique ("land of ebony").
Population.
The municipality had, in 2002, a total population of 7,272: 3,802 men and 3,470 women. The urban population was 20.05% of the total population. In this numbers are included the population of the municipal districts Sabana Cruz and Sabana Higüero.
History.
The town was founded in 1504 by Diego Velázquez, who later went to conquest the island of Cuba, on the left side of the River Artibonite. It was an important town in those years but later it lost its importance. In the century XVIII, the Spanish government moved the city to its present place, away from the river, and brought families from the Canary Islands to live there.
When the Haitian independence, most of the people moved to other places. When the Haitians occupied the eastern part of the island (the present Dominican Republic), they founded again the town as part of the Departement of Artibonite.
After the Independence in 1844, the town was elevated by the Dominican government to the category of municipality of the Azua province. But again the town was abandoned by its inhabitants. After the "Restoration War" (1863 - 1865), some families from other towns close to the Haitian border came to live in Bánica.
Bánica was made a municipality of the San Juan province in 1938 and then, in 1942, of the new province of Elías Piña.
Economy.
The main economic activity of the municipality is agriculture. Commerce with Haiti is also an important economic activity in the city.
