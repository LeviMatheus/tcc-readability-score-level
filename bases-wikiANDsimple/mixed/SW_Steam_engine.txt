A Steam engine is an engine which uses steam power to operate. It can convert the energy present in heat (of water steam usually) into mechanical work. "Steam engines" were used on locomotives or steam boats, but also in factories to move pumps. They were the prime moving force behind the Industrial Revolution. A piston-operated steam engine is called "reciprocal" (back-and-forth) engine.
The steam to power a steam engine is made in a boiler. Water in the boiler is heated to make steam. The steam coming out of the boiler applies the force on a piston or turbine blade. Movement of the piston or the turbine blade is then used to turn wheels or drive other machinery. To boil the water in the boiler, several types of fuels may be used. It may be wood, coal, or oil.
Today almost all steam engines are turbines. They are used on power plants to operate generators which make electricity. Some ships, like large warships, are also powered by steam turbines.
The steam engines were invented by MR. James Watt and it was debutated at the period of the industrial revolution, an economic revolution.
