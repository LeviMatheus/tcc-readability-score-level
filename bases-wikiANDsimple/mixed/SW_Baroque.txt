Baroque is a style epoch. It was between the styles (or epochs) of Renaissance and Neoclassicism. This means it lasted from about 1575 to about 1770. At that time, there were absolutist monarchs in Europe. Baroque art is usually very playful and has many ornaments.
The movement started in Italy. It then spread to the Catholic countries in Europe. Finally, it also spread to the Protestant ones.
The word "Baroque" comes from Portuguese. There, "barocco" means something like "strange".In Portuguese, it was first used for irregularly-shaped pearls. It was first used in France to mean works of art that did not follow the current trend.
