History.
The Eiffel Tower was built by Gustave Eiffel for the 100th year of the French freedom. At first, the Eiffel Tower was to be made in Barcelona, Spain, but the people of Barcelona did not want it. When the tower was built, it was only meant to be kept for 20 years. People did not like the Tower and wanted it taken apart. After the 20 years was over, the tower became the property of Paris again. By this time, the city had learned that the tower could be used to help with communications. The military used the tower to communicate during battle. When the tower was used in the capture of the spy, "Mata Hari", nobody wanted it taken apart.
