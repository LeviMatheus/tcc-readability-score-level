A Lord (Laird in some Scottish contexts) is a person who has power and authority. Women will usually (but not universally) take the title 'Lady' instead of Laird or Lord. But there is an example of a female Lord: "Lord of Mann", the ruler of the Isle of Man.
The word actually comes from the Old English forms for "loaf" (bread) and "ward" (used to mean "protector", although today it means "one who is protected"). So a "lord" or "loaf ward" was originally "the one who protected the loaf".
In a religious context, The Lord means God, mainly by the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity).
