"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District" is the full name of an American trial from 2005. It is also called the Dover trial, because it happened in Dover, Pennsylvania. It said that intelligent design was not science, and could not be taught as science in schools.
About.
Intelligent design is the idea that the universe is not simple enough to be made by nature. Instead, people who believe in intelligent design think that a smarter force must have made everything, or at least important parts of it.
Trial.
Evolution is science's explanation of how all of the different kinds of life developed from a simple beginning. A school in Dover, Pennsylvania tried to get teachers to say intelligent design was better than evolution. Tammy Kitzmiller and ten other parents did not want their children being taught this. They complained to the government, and a trial was held.
Before the trial.
There was an earlier trial called "Edwards v. Aguillard". It was about teaching creationism in schools. Creationism is the belief that God (or something else) created the universe, like it says in the Bible or other religious books.
The United States Constitution is the set of rules that all of the government in the United States must follow. It does not allow the government to support one religion more than any other religion. This means schools run by the government (public schools) cannot teach one type of religion as being true. In "Edwards v. Aguillard", the United States Supreme Court said that creationism was not science. It said it was religious, because it tried to explain things using stories from the Bible. Because of this, the Supreme Court said creationism could not be taught in public schools. But people said intelligent design was not creationism.
During the trail.
During the trial, experts showed that intelligent design was an old argument for religion and not science. They looked at the older copies of the book the school was using. These were from before most people could get the book. It had been changed from being about creationism to being about intelligent design. The authors did this by changing the words "created" to "designed" and "creationists" to "intelligent design proponents". The judge found this interesting. These changes were made just after Edwards v. Aguillard said you could not teach creationism in schools. The judge said this showed that intelligent design was creationism.
In one part of the trial, they spoke to Michael Behe. Behe was one of the people that helped create intelligent design. He said nobody could say how evolution made the immune system, the thing in your body that protects you from diseases. He said that some smarter force had to have made it. They showed him 58 articles, nine books, and lots of other things scientists wrote to show how the immune system could have been made by evolution. He had not read them, but said none of them was "good enough". The judge did not think this was true.
Result.
After the trial, the judge said that intelligent design was creationism, not science. The government is not allowed to support one religion more than any other religion. Creationism had already been shown to be religious. Therefore, schools can't teach intelligent design, as that would be saying one type of religion was true.
