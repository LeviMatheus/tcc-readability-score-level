June 6, 1944, also known as D-Day, stands for the biggest amphibious (from the sea to the land) attack in military history, known as "Operation Overlord". D-Day took place during World War II on the beach of Normandy. The Allies (British and American) attacked Nazi-German occupied Europe. It was very important for the Allied success in World War II. Though many men were lost when the beaches were taken over. After that, about two months later, after very hard fighting and many killed, the Allies won. They freed France from the Germans.
Many people think D-Day stands for Decision Day, but it does not, the first letter is just to show the importance of the day.
June 6th is very important to many Americans, British, and Canadians because of what happened.
Often, the day something big happens, when a decision that can't be changed is made, it is called "D-Day".
