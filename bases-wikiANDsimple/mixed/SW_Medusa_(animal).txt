A Medusa (also called jellyfish) is one of two forms of certain animals that live in the water. The other form is the polyp. Medusae usually have many tentacles with which they catch their prey. Very often, people bathing in the ocean are touched by a medusa. Their tentacles contain a poison. People should see a doctor, for there have been deaths for being touched by a medusa.
