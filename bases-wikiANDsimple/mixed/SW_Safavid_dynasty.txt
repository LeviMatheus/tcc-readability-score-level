The Safavids (Persian: صفویان) were an Iranian Shia dynasty of mixed Azerbaijani and Kurdish origins which ruled Iran from 1501/1502 to 1722. The Safavids made the greatest Iranian empire since the Islamic conquest of Persia, and established the Ithnāˤashari (twelver) school of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, making one of the most important turning points in the history of Islam.
