A fairy or færie (Old English spelling) is a supposed magical being that flies in the air. They are usually depicted as small women. Some færies are supposed to do certain things, such as the Tooth fairy, which is supposed to give money under the pillow of small children who have had a tooth fall out. A fairy tale is a story with a plot involving fairies. These stories are usually for children. Fairies can also be found in folklore, for instance, in Ireland, fairies are still held as creatures that were defeated by the human race thousands of years ago and now live in caverns in the world of faerie.
