The European Court of Human Rights (ECoHR) hears and decides particular type of complaints. These complaints relate to abuse of human rights. ECoHRâ€™s other popular name is "Strasbourg Court". Member countries of the Council of Europe created ECoHR to arrange all such complaints, listen to the complaints, and to give decisions. European Convention on Human Rights tells about many human rights. ECoHR sees that people should enjoy all these human rights.
ECoHR' has a number of judges. The number of judges are equal to the number of member countries of the Council of Europe. At present, there are forty six member countries of the Council of Europe. Each country may have one judge in the ECoHR. But, judges work independently for the ECoHR, and not for their country.
