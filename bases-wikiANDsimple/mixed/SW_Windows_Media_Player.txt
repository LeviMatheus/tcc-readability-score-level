Windows Media Player is a digital media player made by Microsoft. It is already installed on Microsoft Windows operating systems, and an older version is available for some Apple Macintosh operating systems. The program allows people to watch certain video files and play music files that are in a compatible format. How the program looks can also be changed with skins, and it can be made small enough to fit on the taskbar.
