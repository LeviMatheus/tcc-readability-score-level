Brontosaurus (meaning "thunder lizard") was a dinosaur which is now considered to be an Apatosaurus. Othniel Charles Marsh, who had discovered and named Brontosaurs, thought he found a new type of dinosaur. Actually, scientists had put the head of a Camarasaurus on the body of an Apatosaurus. Some scientists argued it should be called an Apatosaurus as early as 1903. Most agreed with this by the 1970s.
