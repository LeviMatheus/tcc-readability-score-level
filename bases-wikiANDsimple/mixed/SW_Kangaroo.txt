A kangaroo is an animal. It is a kind of mammal. It belongs to the genus macropus. It is common in Australia and can also be found on nearby islands. Kangaroos hop to move around. They cannot walk backwards but they can hop or jump as far as about three times their own height.
Kangaroos are marsupials because they carry their young in special pouch on their bodies. Baby kangaroos are called joeys.
Because it is mostly found in Australia, Australians see it as a national symbol.
