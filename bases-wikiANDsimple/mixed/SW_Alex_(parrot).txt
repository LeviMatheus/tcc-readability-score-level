Alex was an African grey parrot.
Purpose.
He was part of a study under animal psychologist Irene Pepperberg since 1977 at two different universities: Brandeis University in Massachusetts and before that, University of Arizona. He died on Sept 7, 2007, of yet unknown causes. He knew about 100 words as of 2000, and is not ordinary because he appears to understand what he says. For example, when Alex is shown an object and is asked about its shape, color, or material, he can label it correctly. If he is asked the difference between two things, he will also answer that, but if there is no difference between the things, he will say “none.”
Alex's name is an acronym. ALEX is short for Avian Learning EXperiment.
