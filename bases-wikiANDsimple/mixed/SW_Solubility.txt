Solubility means the ability for a given substance, the solute, to dissolve in a solvent.
It is measured in terms of the maximum amount of solute dissolved in a solvent at equilibrium.
The resulting solution is called a saturated solution. Certain substances are soluble in all proportions with a given solvent. An example of this is ethanol in water. This property is more correctly described as miscible.
