A frugivore is an animal that feeds on fruit. This way of feeding can be more efficient (effective) than eating other parts of a plant, because there are more nutrients (sugars, vitamins and proteins) in the fruit.
Plant and frugivore relationship.
The fruit is a very important part of the plant, because it contains the nutrients for the seed to grow from before it has roots of leaves. Some plants have evolved ways to protect their fruit. Other plants have evolved to attract animals that will eat the fruit and spread the seed. Some seeds need to pass through the digestive system (the stomach and intestines) before it can grow.
Frugivores have also evolved in different ways to eat different fruit, some use teeth, others long beaks or short beaks. Frugivores also have evolved so that without one kind of fruit they cannot survive. This is why if one species (kind of plant or animal) becomes extinct, other species may have problems or even become extinct as well.
Other seeds cannot survive if they are eaten. This means that only fruit which are not eaten can help their seed to grow. In this way, fruit with spikes, or thick skins, as well as bad-tasting or even poisonous fruit have evolved. However, some animals can even eat these fruit. For example some caterpillars have evolved to use the poison from fruit to stop other animals from eating them.
Examples of frugivores.
Many birds eat both fruits and insects. Mammals may eat both fruits and animals, or eat mostly fruit or fruit juices, such as many bats. Some primates are frugivores, for example the Gray-bellied Night Monkey. Some people say that humans are frugivores, too, and promote (say that people should try) a frugivore diet.
