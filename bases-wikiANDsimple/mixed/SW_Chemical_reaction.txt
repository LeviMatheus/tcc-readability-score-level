Some reactions are very fast, and others are very slow. Some happen at different speeds, depending on temperature or other things. For example, wood does not react with air when it is cold, but if it is made hot enough, it will start to burn.
Some reactions give out energy. These are called "exothermic". For other reactions, energy must be put in to make them happen. These are called "endothermic".
