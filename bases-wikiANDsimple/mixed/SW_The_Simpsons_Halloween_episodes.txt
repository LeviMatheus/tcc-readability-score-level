The Simpsons Halloween Episodes or The Simpsons Halloween Specials is a seasonal special TV episode that is aired in every season where there are three different Halloween-based stories. Most of the time the episodes are about something really scary, unusual, or science-fictional event happening to the family. Since they have nothing to do with the real episodes, they are considered non-canonical (things that don't really happen).
Most of the time the family encounter horrible things like zombies, aliens, monsters, witches, or sometimes each other. Some episodes spoof horror or science-fiction films (most notably, shows from The Twilight Zone).
