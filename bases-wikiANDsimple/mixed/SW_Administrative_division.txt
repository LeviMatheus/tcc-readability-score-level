Administrative division is a term for an administrative region within a country — on a level below that of the sovereign state — typically with a local government with a certain degree of autonomy.
Administrative divisions also exist in Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Myamar and formerly Pakistan and British India. See Division (country subdivision). (The term division alone normally means a military unit.)
