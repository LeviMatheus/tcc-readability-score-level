Neurotransmitters are chemicals. They transmit information between different neurons. Inside the neuron, the information is transmitted as electrical signal. On the boundary of the cell, these potentials are then translated to a certain amount of a chemical. At the other end, the translation occurs again from a chemical into an electrical signal. They are complicated.
