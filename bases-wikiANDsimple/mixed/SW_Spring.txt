Spring is the season after winter and before summer. The weather gets warmer because the ground is tilted towards the Sun. In many parts of the world plants grow and flowers bloom. Often people with hay fever suffer more. Many animals have their breeding seasons in spring.
At the start of spring, many people suffering from "Seasonal Affecting Disorder" often stop their symptoms.
