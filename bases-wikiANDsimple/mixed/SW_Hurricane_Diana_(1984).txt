Hurricane Diana was really unusual and had forecasters guessing when or where it would strike. In September of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season, Diana became an intense tropical cyclone, bringing maximum sustained winds of 136 mph during its peak. The storm eventually made landfall in southeast North Carolina with winds around 88 to 100 miles an hour. No direct fatalities were reported, though three indirect deaths did happen because of Hurricane Diana in September 1984.
