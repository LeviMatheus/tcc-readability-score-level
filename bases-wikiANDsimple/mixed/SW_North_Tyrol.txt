North Tyrol, or North Tirol (German: Nordtirol) is the main part of the Austrian state of Tyrol, located in the western part of the country. The other part of the state is East Tyrol, which also belongs to Austria, but does not share a border with North Tyrol.
Besides those two regions, the historical region of Tyrol for many centuries also included the areas today known as Bolzano-Bozen and Trento, which were annexed by Italy after World War I. By that, North Tyrol and East Tyrol were effectively cut of from each other.
North Tyrol borders Salzburg in the east, the German state of Bavaria in the north, Vorarlberg in the west, the Swiss canton of Graub√ºnden in the southwest and Bolzano-Bozen in the south. Its capital is Innsbruck.
