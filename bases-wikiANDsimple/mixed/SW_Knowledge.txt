Knowledge means the "things someone knows", such as information they have learned. If someone understands an idea or is aware of something, then he or she has "knowledge" of it. When it makes sense to someone, this "knowledge" becomes "understanding". A "knowledgeable" person is someone who knows a lot. If someone has "know-how" it means that they can put "knowledge" to work in doing or building something.
Origin.
Knowledge comes from being in an environment, having some experience there, and then sharing what was learned - so that others do not have to be in that environment or have that experience to "know" what someone else knows.
Type of knowledge.
When doing science, it is necessary to set up a strict experiment so that the important elements of the environment and experience are repeatable and so that simple numbers or models can be shared afterward.
Other types of knowledge.
Other types of knowledge can be for a more specific purpose, for example learning a language. In business the field of knowledge sharing deals with the use of computers to record and share what employees know.
