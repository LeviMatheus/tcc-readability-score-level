Hernando de Soto (born June 2, 1941 in Lima) is a Peruvian economist. He has become known for his owrks on the Informal economy and property rights.
Private ownership is needed.
In his books, de Soto says that people in developing countries do ont have a sophisticated system of owning property. This means that there is no formal certificate that says that land or goods really belong to a certain person -this is then called "informal ownership". In his opinion,
the capitalist economies of the United States or States could only develop because they had a clear system of ownership of property - this was developed during the colonisation of the American Continent, or after the Second World War, in Japan.
Because such systems do not exist in developing countries, the poor people in tohse nations cannot develop - they cannot use their land as a guarantee to the bank to get money to build something, for example. De Soto argues that this is the basis for enterpreneurship.. In much of the developing world,famers therefore are left with subsistence agriculture. As such, he argues that this informal ownership should be made formal, for example by giving squatters in shanty towns land titles to the land they now live on.
