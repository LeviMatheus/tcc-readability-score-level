Exmoor is a national park in England. The border of two counties, Devon and Somerset, runs through it. It is an area of sandstone hills which form tall cliffs on its north coast. The high ground of Exmoor is mostly rough grassland, but there are small woodlands on its lower slopes.
It is also famous for the Exmoor Pony.
