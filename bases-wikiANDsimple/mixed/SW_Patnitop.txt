Patnitop or Patni Top, is a hill top tourist location in Udhampur District on the National Highway 1A, on the way from Udhampur to Srinagar (Iqbalabad). It is located in the Shiwalik belt of the Himalayas, and is in Jammu and Kashmir, Kashmir. The river Chenab flows in close proximity to this location.
Origin of the name Patnitop is a distortion of the original name of "Patan Da Talab" meaning "Pond of the Princess". In olden times a pond existed in the meadows and the kings princess often used to have her bath there. Part of the pond still exists near the youth hostel.The Britishers probably couldn't get the name correctly in their revenue records, and over the years it changed from "Patan Da Talab" to Patnitop.
