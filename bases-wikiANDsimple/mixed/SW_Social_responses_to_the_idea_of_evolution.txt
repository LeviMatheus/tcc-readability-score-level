The idea that all life evolved has been hotly debated, even before Charles Darwin published "On the Origin of species". Even today, some people still talk about the concept of evolution and what it means to them, to their philosophy and their religion. Sometimes these people also talk about the social implications of evolution. This debate is mostly about the meaning of evolution, and not about how evolution works.
Debates about evolution.
Some people believe in "guided evolution" or "theistic evolution". They say that evolution is real, but they say, that someone is guiding it in certain ways. There are many different concepts of "theistic evolution". Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution. As Darwin found out early on, the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is its implications for human origins.
In some countries, especially in the United States, there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who reject it. The debate is mostly about if the ideas in evolution should be taught in schools, and in what way.
Other fields, such as cosmology and earth science also conflict with the original writings of many religious texts. Evolutionary biology is opposed much more from religious believers than other groups or organizations.
Abusing evolution.
People tend to try and support their beliefs. For instance, a bit of the Bible where, after Noah's Ark landed, Noah got drunk while naked and Ham laughed at him, and was cursed by Noah somehow became part of a justification for racism and slavery. Later, people tried to use evolution to support racism. Evolution itself does not support racism, but people wanting to justify racism claimed that black people were inferior, and thus said that because evolution shows that, in nature, "better" animals tend to survive, leading to evolution of improved animals, that since they were clearly "better", they had the right to oppress the "weaker". But they were not actually better, so they were wrong to say this.
One way people claimed evolution could promote discrimination and racism was to say that only the "better" people should have children. The idea to improve the human species in this way is called Eugenics. One of the people who had such ideas was Francis Galton. Galton was a very bright scientist, and meant to do good.He said that the human gene pool should be improved by selective breeding policies. This would mean that those who were considered "good stock" would receive a reward if they reproduced. However, other people added to this, and said those considered "bad stock" would need to undergo compulsory sterilization, prenatal testing and birth control; and they might even have to be killed. Galton's idea got used in very bad ways. His idea was also wrong, because there's so many different skills people could have, so you couldn't tell who was "good stock" and who was "bad stock" anyway.
Another example of using wrong ideas about evolution to support bad things is "Social Darwinism". Social Darwinism is a term given to the 19th century Whig Malthusian theory started by Herbert Spencer. Spencer had ideas about "survival of the fittest", which he tried to apply to commerce and human societies as a whole. Other people used these ideas to claim that social differences, racism, and imperialism were justified. Today, most scientists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be used to support such ideas. They also say that it is difficult to find data that can support them.
Controversy.
Certain people oppose the idea of evolution. They disagree with it for a number of reasons. Most often these reasons are influenced by their religious beliefs. Their beliefs are usually called creationism or intelligent design.
Despite this, evolution is one of the most successful theories in science. People have found it to be useful for different kinds of research. None of the other proposals explain things, such as fossil records, as well. So, for almost all scientists, evolution is not in doubt.
