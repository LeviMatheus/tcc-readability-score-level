The "open block" is a problem first described in ' by Edward de Bono, published in 1973.
The problem is that in some cases people ignore certain things that may solve a problem, because the already have an idea how the problem should be solved.
The may therefore not recognise certain solutions to the problem. For example, if a person's car breaks down, the open block of being used to being in a car may cause them to wait for a taxi, ignoring buses passing by, without even reading the destinations.
In this book de Bono suggested a number of techniques for overcoming the open block, including going back and challenging assumptions as well as generating new ideas for addressing problems.
The open block can be overcome by Lateral Thinking
