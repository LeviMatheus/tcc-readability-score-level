The word evangelicalism mostly means religious practices and traditions which are found in conservative Protestant Christianity.
Evangelicalism is typified by an emphasis on evangelism, a personal experience of conversion, biblically oriented faith and a belief in the importance of Christian faith to cultural issues. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, Protestant people, churches and social movements have often been called "evangelical" in contrast to Protestant liberalism.
In continental Europe the word Evangelical is often understood to mean Protestant or even Lutheran as a literal translation of the German "evangelisch". In Germany, the Protestant religious group known as Lutherans in the USA and other places throughout the world are exclusively referred to as "die Evangelischen" or the Evangelicals belonging to the Evangelical Church in Germany.
