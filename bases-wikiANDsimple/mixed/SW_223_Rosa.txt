223 Rosa is a big Main belt asteroid. It is classified as a combination of C-type and P-type asteroids, so it is probably made of carbonaceous material with lots of water ice. It is also a member of the Themis asteroid family.
It was found by Johann Palisa on March 9, 1882 in Vienna.
Where the name comes from is unknown.
