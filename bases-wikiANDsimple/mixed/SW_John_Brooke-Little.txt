John Philip Brooke Brooke-Little (6 April 1927â€“13 February 2006) was an officer of arms from England.
In 1950 he founded "The Coat of Arms" which is the journal of the Heraldry Society of England. 50 years later, for its "Golden Jubilee" the society published a collection of essays called "Tribute to an Armorist" in his honour.
