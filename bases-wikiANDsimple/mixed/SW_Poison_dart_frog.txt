Poison dart frog is the common name of a group of frogs in the family "Dendrobatidae". They are native to Central and South America. Unlike most frogs, this species is active during the day. Also, they often have brightly-colored bodies. Although all dendrobatids are at least somewhat toxic in the wild, levels of toxicity vary greatly from one species to the next, and from one population to another. Many species are critically endangered.
