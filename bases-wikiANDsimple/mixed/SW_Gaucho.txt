Gaucho (or Ga√∫cho) is the term commonly used for people who live in the south regions of Brazil, mainly in Rio Grande do Sul. It can also be used for people from Uruguay, Argentina and Chile.
It is roughly the same as the North American cowboy, however the gauchos dress quite differently from cowboys and have different habits.
