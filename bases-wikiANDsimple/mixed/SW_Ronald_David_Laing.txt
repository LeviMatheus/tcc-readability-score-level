Ronald David Laing (born in the 7th of October of the 1927 in Glasgow (Scotland and died in the 23rd of August of the 1989), was a Scottish psychiatrist who described the mental illness, especially the psychosis.
Laing is known for his theories on the causes of the mental perturbations. His theory on the "schizogenous" (?) parents was to exclude him from the psychiatric orthodoxy of his times. He often was connected in thought with the movement antiantipsychiatric, although he rejected that epithet.
