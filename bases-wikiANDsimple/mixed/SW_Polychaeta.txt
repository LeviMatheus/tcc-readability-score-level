Polychateta (more commonly called Polychaetes, or bristle worms) are a class of annelids. They are generally found in a marine environment. Each of their body segments has some fleshy protrusions that stand out. These protrusions usually have many bristles, which are made of chitin. There are more than 10.000 known species in this class. It is different from the "Oligochaeta". Oligochaeta are similar in design, but only have a few bristles. Common animals of the group are the lugworm, and the clam worm "Nereis" (which is sometimes also called sandworm).
