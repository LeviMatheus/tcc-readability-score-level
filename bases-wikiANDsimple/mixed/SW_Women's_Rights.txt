Women's Rights is a movement and action of feminism, where women believe they rightfully deserve what men have. Women's Rights have fought things such as letting women vote and do mens' jobs such as doing construction work. Although women and men can both stand for this movement, mainly women stand for it. Movements such as impeaching and so on have created rights for women.
