The B vitamin complex (also called B vitamins) are 8 vitamins. They have an important role in the metabolism of cells. Originally, people thought they were just different forms of one vitamin (like with Vitamin D, for example). Later it turned out that they are separate vitamins that often can be found together.
They are Thiamine, Riboflavin, Niacin,Pantothenic acid, Vitamin B6, Biotin, Folic acid and Cyanocobalamin.
