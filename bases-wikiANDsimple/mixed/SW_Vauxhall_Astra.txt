History.
In 1979, General Motors, the owners of Vauxhall, decided to replace the Viva model (Kaddett in Europe including Republic of Ireland) in the United Kingdom in as Vauxhall's small family car. The model still shared its body with the Kaddett, however it had things suited for use in this country, i.e. the steering wheel on the right side so that owners could drive on the the left-hand side of the road. In 1991, Opel and Chevrolet both binned the Kaddett name. Therefore, they adopted the Astra one. In 1995, Holden did that too. It was only in South Africa that the Kaddett name continued, and it was only on the Astra hatchback. In 1999, the year after the launch of the Opel Astra G/B, South Africa binned the Kaddett name too, leaving no countries/regions/continents using the Kaddett badge. In 2004, the Opel Astra H/C was launched. Saturn launched the Saturn Astra in 2007, replacing the Ion as their smallest model. The ninth/fourth Generation Astra is expected to be launched in 2009.
