Despina or Neptune V, is the third closest moon to Neptune. It is named after Despina, a nymph who was a daughter of Poseidon.
Despina was found in late July, 1989 from the images taken by the "Voyager 2" probe. It was given the designation S/1989 N 3.
Despina is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes.
