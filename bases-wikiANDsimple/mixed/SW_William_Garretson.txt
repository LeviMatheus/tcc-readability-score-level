William Garretson (born August 24, 1949 in Lancaster, Ohio) was the caretaker of the Polanski residence at the time of Sharon Tate's murder by the Charles Manson family. On the morning after the murders, he was arrested on charges of suspicion of murder, but was released shortly after. He was so devastated that it took him over twenty years to talk about that horrible day in 1969.
