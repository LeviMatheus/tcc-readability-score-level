Trichotillomania (TTM), or "trich" as it is commonly known, is a disorder causing a person to take out hair from anywhere on the body, sometimes ending in notable areas without hair. Trichotillomania is listed in the "Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders" as an "impulse control disorder", but there are questions about how it should be listed. At different times, it may seem to be a habit, an addiction, a tic disorder, or an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
