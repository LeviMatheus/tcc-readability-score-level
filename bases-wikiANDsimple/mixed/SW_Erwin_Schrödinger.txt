Erwin Rudolf Josef Alexander Schrödinger (* August 12th, 1887 in Vienna-Erdberg; † January 4th 1961 in Vienna) was an Austrian Physicist.
He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.
Life.
Schrödinger went to the Academic Gymnasium from 1898 to 1906.
Afterwards he studied mathematics and physics in Vienna and wrote his habilitation up from 1910.
He was soldier in World War I. Afterwards he got professorships in Zürich, Jena, Breslau and Stuttgart. In 1920 he married.
in 1927 he went to Berlin to fellow Max Planck.

Three years later he returned to Austria and became professor in Graz.
In 1938 he had to leave Austria, because the Nazis had taken over government.
He went to Dublin and became director of the School for Theoretical Physics.
In 1956 he returned to Vienna and got a professorship for Theoretical Physics.
He died of tuberculosis in 1961.
Important work.
Schrödingers most important work is the wave mecanics - a formation of quantum mechanics, and specially the Schrödinger equation. He worked on the field of biophysics, too. He invented the concept of negentropy and helped to develop molecular biology.
