A dive bomber is a bomber aircraft that dives towards the ground so it can get very close to its targets. This means it is more likely to hit them. This can also limit the chance of anti-aircraft fire.
Diving nearly vertically at the target, in the same direction the bombs will take, the aircraft will release the bombs very close to the target at high speed. This allows a dive bomber to accurately place bombs on relatively small target, or a moving target quite easily. Additionally, no complicated precision equipment is needed. Dive bombers were widely used to attack high value targets such as ships and bridges. This also had the advantage of attacking ships at a weak spot; armour was the heaviest near the waterline and thin or non-existent on the deck. Also, dive bombing allowed relatively small aeroplanes carrying limited bomb load to produce more damage than usual.
