The Adam's apple is clinically known as the laryngeal prominence and is a feature of the human neck. This lump is formed by the angle of the thyroid cartilage that surrounds the larynx.
Sex differences.
The adam's apple is usually more prominent in adult men than in women or girls or boys. The adam's apple is only the lump that one sees of the thyroid cartilage making up the body of the larynx. Some suggest that the reason for the laryngeal prominence usually being more prominent in males is that the two laminae of the thyroid cartilage that form the protrusion meet at an angle of 90° in males but that angle is usually 120° in females. This theory, however, seems more like conjecture when the fact is taken into consideration that with most women with a large laryngeal prominence appear no different from those seen on men.
A prominent adam's apple is commonly seen as a male secondary sex characteristic though this is more of a perception because not all males have it and quite a few women have one.
