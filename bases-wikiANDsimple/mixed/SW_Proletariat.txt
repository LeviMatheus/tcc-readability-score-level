A proletariat (often shortened, "prole" in slang) is a term commonly used by Communists,
to describe the class of workers in an urban area, who work in the service industry or the manufacturing industry. These urban workers are different from the peasants, who are workers who do farming jobs in rural areas.
The political way of thinking of Communism states that the proletariat should have a revolution and take over the means of production. They are often sarcastically referred to as "wage-slaves."
