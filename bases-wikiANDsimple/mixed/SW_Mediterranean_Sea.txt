The Mediterranean Sea is a body of water that separates Europe, Africa and Asia.
The Mediterranean Sea is a part of the Atlantic Ocean almost completely surrounded by land, on the north by Europe, on the south by Africa, and on the east by Asia. It covers around 2.5 million km² (965 000 mi²).
It was a superhighway of transport in ancient times, allowing for trade and cultural exchange between peoples of the region — Phoenicians, Egyptians, Carthaginians, Greeks, Romans, and the Middle East (Arab/Persian/Semitic) cultures. The history of the Mediterranean is important in understanding the origin and development of Western Civilization.
