Appearance.
Princess Peach's appearance has changed over the years. In her first apperance, "Super Mario Bros." (1985), she had red hair and wore pajamas. She had brown hair in "Super Mario Bros. 2" (1986). In "Super Mario World" (1991), she finally appeared in her modern appearance, with blonde hair. In the "Mario" sport series games, she often wears different dresses because she cannot play well in her regular, long, pink dress
Her name has been changed. In Japan, she was always known as Peach. When they released "Super Mario Bros." elsewhere, they renamed her Princess Toadstool. In "Super Mario 64", they finally gave her name as Peach.
Peach appears most often as the damsel-in-distress â€“ always being kidnapped by Bowser. Mario must always rescue her. In "Super Princess Peach" (2006), the tables are turned and Bowser kidnaps Mario instead. Peach must then rescue Mario.
Peach has been voiced by two different actresses. The first was Leslie Swan. The second was Jen Taylor.
