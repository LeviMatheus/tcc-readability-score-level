Sea snakes, or "seasnakes", are poisonous elapid snakes that live in marine environments for most or all of their lives. They evolved from their ancestors who lived on land. Some sea snakes still have some of the behaviour and traits of their ancestors left (like Laticauda who can also move a litlle on land). Most sea snakes are well adapted to living in the water all the time. They are unable to even move on land. They are found in warm coastal waters from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific. All have paddle-like tails and many have laterally compressed bodies - they look somewhat like eels. However, unlike fish, they do not have gills and must come to the surface regularly to breathe. Nevertheless, they are among the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species with some of the most potent poisons of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, while others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17 genera are described as sea snakes, with 62 species.
