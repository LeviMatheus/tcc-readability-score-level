Ranger Uranium Mine is a large uranium deposit located within the borders of the Kakadu National Park. The uranium is legally owned by the Australian Government, and is sold internationally. This mining, and the presence of uranium in Kakadu have come under controversy, due to the widespread publicity regarding the potential danger of nuclear power and uranium mining.
Kakadu can be found on the World Heritage List, both for its cultural and natural value, a rare feat because few sites are featured for both reasons.
