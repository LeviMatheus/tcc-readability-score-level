In historiography and other areas of scholarship, a primary source (also called original source) is a document, recording or other source of information that was created at the time that is studied. Usually it was produced by someone with direct personal knowledge of the events that are described.
It is used as an original source of information about the topic. Primary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which often build upon primary sources.
