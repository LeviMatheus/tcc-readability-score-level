An assault rifle is a rifle that has a magazine that can be removed, can be fired automatically, and fires bullets that do not have the power of other rifles like hunting rifles or battle rifles, but have more power and penatration then pistol bullets fired by submachine guns.
The first assault rifles were Russian, but the Germans in World War II were the first to use assault rifles in large numbers.
An example of an assault rifle is the AK-47.
