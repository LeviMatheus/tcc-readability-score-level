Unison is a word meaning “one sound”. In music it is used to mean that all instruments or voices are sounding at the same pitch.
In church music the words “unison” and “harmony” are used a lot. “Unison” means that everyone sings the tune. In fact, the men will be singing an octave lower than the women and children, but it is still loosely called “unison”. When the choir split into “harmony” they sing four different parts. They are no longer singing in unison.
