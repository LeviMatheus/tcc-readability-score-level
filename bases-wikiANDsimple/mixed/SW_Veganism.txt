Veganism is a philosophy that says people should not use animals in any way.
Veganism is a lifestyle. Vegans choose not to eat food that comes from animals, including meat, eggs and dairy products (like milk, cheese, and yogurt). A vegan diet is sometimes called a strict vegetarian diet. Vegans also do not eat honey. Vegans try not to use any other animal products, such as leather, wool, feathers, bone, or pearl. They also try to avoid products that have been tested on animals. Some vegans campaign for animal rights.
Vegans do eat all kinds of fruits, vegetables, beans, grains, nuts, and seeds, and things made from them like vegan sweets, vegan cheese and vegan cakes.
Some people become vegan because they find about the bad treatment of animals in the modern animal farm industry. Other reasons to become vegan are health, to protect the environment, for religious reasons, or because of world hunger. Animals use most of the food they eat for their own life, not to 'grow' meat, milk or eggs. So a lot of food, land and water is wasted by keeping animals for food.
