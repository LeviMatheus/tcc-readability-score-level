Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (or just Paul Kruger) (October 10, 1825 â€“ July 14, 1904) was the president of the Transvaal Republic (South African Republic) from 1880 to 1900. He became famous for leading the Boers against the British at the time of the Boer War.
Early Life.
Kruger grew up on his grandfather's farm. He worked as a commando (a soldier defending farms), and became a respected leader.
First Boer War.
In 1877 the British Army took control of Transvaal, and Kruger became the leader of the resistance (the people who wanted to fight British control). On December 30, 1880, the government of Transvaal elected (chose) him to be president. In 1881, the British lost the first Boer War, and Kruger negotiated (talked with the enemy to agree) the peace.
Kruger travelled to Europe, where many people respected him.
Second Boer War.
The Second Boer War began in 1899, and Kruger had to escape to Europe in October 1900. He moved to Clarens in Switzerland, where he died in 1904. People took his body back to South Africa and buried him in Church Street Cemetery in Pretoria
