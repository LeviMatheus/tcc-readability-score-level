Apatosaurus (meaning "deceptive lizard") was a sauropod dinosaur that lived in the Jurassic Period. It was known before as "Brontosaurus". It grew as big as 21 meters long, 4.5 meters tall at the hip, and weighed up to 35 metric tons. It ate plants. The bones of Apatosaurus have been found in Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Utah in the United States.
When it was first found, scientists thought that Apatosaurus lived partly under water, since it could not hold its own weight on dry land. Now they think it lived on dry land, probably in herds.
