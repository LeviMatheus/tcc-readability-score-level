A monsoon is a seasonal wind which lasts for several months. The word was first used in English in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and neighboring countries to talk about the seasonal winds blowing from the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea in the southwest bringing heavy rainfall to the area. In hydrology, monsoonal rainfall is considered to be that which happens in any region that receives the majority of its rain during a particular season, and so monsoons are referred to in relation to other regions such as in North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil and East Asia.
