A histogram is a concept from statistics. It is a graphical display that tells about the distribution of the samples involved. It is basically the graphical display of a table with many categories. The table tells for each category how many samples there are in it.
The word "histogram" is derived from "histos" and "gramma" in Greek. "Histos" means "web" or "mast". "Gramma" means "drawing", "record" or "writing". A histogram of something is therefore, etymologically speaking, a drawing of the web of this something.
The histogram is one of the seven basic tools of quality control, which also include the Pareto chart, check sheet, control chart, cause-and-effect diagram, flowchart, and scatter diagram.
A generalization of the histogram is kernel smoothing techniques. This will construct a smooth Probability density function from the supplied data.
