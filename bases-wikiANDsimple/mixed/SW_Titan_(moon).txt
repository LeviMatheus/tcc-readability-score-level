Titan is one of Saturn's 56 moons. It is 5150 km wide and it moves in a circle 1,221,931 km away from Saturn. It was found by Christiaan Huygens on March 25, 1655. Titan is the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest of the solar system. Titan is larger than the size of Mercury. Titan is the only moon with air but a person cannot breathe that air. That air is too cold and it is bad. It would kill a man. The air is made of nitrogen and methane. It is also the only place in the Solar System, except Earth, that has lakes and lots of liquid on its surface, but it is liquid methane, not water.
On July 1, 2004, the Cassini-Huygens probe entered into orbit around Saturn. On December 25, 2004, the Huygens probe separated from the Cassini probe before moving down towards Titan's surface and landed there on January 14, 2005. It landed on a dry surface, but it confirmed that large bodies of liquid exist on the moon. The Cassini probe continued to gain data of Titan and a number of the icy moons. It found evidence that the moon Enceladus had water erupting from its geysers. Cassini also proved in July, 2006 that Titan contained hydrocarbon lakes, located near its north pole. In March, 2007, it discovered a large hydrocarbon lake the size of the Caspian Sea near its north pole.
