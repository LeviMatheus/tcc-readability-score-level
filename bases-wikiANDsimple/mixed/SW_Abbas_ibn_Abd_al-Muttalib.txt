`Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib () (c. 566 – c. 653) was a uncle and companion of Muhammad.
Background.
Muhammad had 10 or 11 uncles. Four of them earned a great name in history - Abu Talib, Abu Lahab, Hamza and Abbas. Abu Talib became important because he brought up his orphan nephew, Muhammad, with great love and care and always supported and protected him. Abu Lahab is famous because he tried to "destroy" Islam. Both Hamza and ‘Abbas became Muslims and remained firm and strong in their faith in Islam.
