Alfred the Great (c. 849 - 26 October 899) was king of Wessex from 871 to 899. He was the first monarch from the British Isles to style himself as 'King of the Anglo-Saxons' and so he is sometimes considered the first English king. Alfred started the Royal Navy in the 9th century.
Alfred earned the name 'the Great' by defending the kingdom from Viking invasions. Alfred was a scholar and encouraged education in the kingdom as well as improving the legal system.
He married Alswitha of Mercia, b. 852 - d. 905, known as Queen Ealswitha. She is buried at the Church of St. Lawrence in the Square, Winchester, England.
Alfred died in 899 but it is not known how he died. He was succeeded by his son, Edward the Elder.
