Terrorism is the act of scaring people for a social or political reason using violence (or threat of violence). A person who uses terrorism is called a terrorist.
Terrorists think that if civilians are afraid of them, they will have more power over other people. But a boy who hits his sister only for attention is not a terrorist (although it may hurt very badly). Terrorists may also be trying to make their enemies attack the people whom the terrorists claim to represent. The terrorists do this because they think that the people who have been attacked will help them. For example, terrorism has been endemic to Israel for a long time. There, Palestinian Hamas terrorists killed Israeli civilians in bomb attacks, provoking Israel into carrying out revenge attacks against Palestinian civilians, thus increasing Palestinian hate for Israel and support for Hamas. An example of a well-known terrorist is Osama bin Laden, the founder of al-Qaeda and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Although some people first picture terrorists as Muslims or religious groups, but this is not necessarily correct. An example of a non-religious sepratist-terrorist group would be Euskadi Ta Askatasuna also known as the ETA.
According to the National Counterterrorism Center, terrorists killed 20,498 people in 2006. By comparison, the World Health Organization estimates that 2 million people die each year from tuberculosis. The major effects of terrorism comes from the fear it generates.
Terrorist operations are usually financed by other criminal programs, such as identity theft.
