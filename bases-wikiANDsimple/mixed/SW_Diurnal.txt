Animals that are active during the day are called diurnal. They hunt or feed during the day and sleep during the night. Nocturnal animals do it the other way round.
Scientists sometimes use the word "crepuscular" to describe nocturnal animals that aren't active when it is very dark at night; they are mostly active near dawn, dusk, and sometimes when the moon makes a lot of light.
