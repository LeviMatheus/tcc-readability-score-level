330 Adalberta is a small Main belt asteroid.
It was found by Max Wolf on February 2, 1910 in Heidelberg.
An object found March 18, 1892 by Max Wolf with provisional designation "1892 X" was named 330 Adalberta, but was lost and never seen again after that. In 1982 it was noticed that the sightings leading to the designation of 1892 X were stars, and the object never existed. The name and number 330 Adalberta was then used again for another asteroid found by Max Wolf on February 2, 1910, which had the provisional designation A910 CB.
