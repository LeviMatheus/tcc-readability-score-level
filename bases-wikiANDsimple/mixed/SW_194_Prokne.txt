194 Prokne is a very big and dark main belt asteroid. It is made of carbonates.
It was found by C. H. F. Peters on March 21, 1879 in Clinton, New York and named after Procne, the sister of Philomela in Greek mythology.
Stellar occultations by Prokne have been seen twice, in 1984 from Italy and again in 1999 from Iowa (United States).
