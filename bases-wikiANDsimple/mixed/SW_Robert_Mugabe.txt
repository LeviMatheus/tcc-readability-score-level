Robert Gabriel Mugabe KCB (born February 21, 1924) has been the President of Zimbabwe since 1987. Before that time, he was Prime Minister of the country. Especially in the last few years, Mr. Mugabe has ruled his country in the style of a dictator.
His first years as leader were prosperous. He introduced land reforms, which were supposed to give the land claimed by white people back to the (original) black owners. This has had a serious impact on how the country is seen from outside. The reforms were done in 1998. In 2001, the United Nations imposed sanctions against Zimbabwe. This was done because human rights abuses came to the attention of the United Nations.
At present, people are unsure how the country can tackle its problems. Also, it is unclear what will happen after Mr. Mugabe dies, as there seems to be a vacuum. A struggle for who is to come after him would begin. The disastrous Socialist economic policies that Mugabe has adopted have produced extreme poverty, widespread suffering 1200% inflation and 80% unemployment.
