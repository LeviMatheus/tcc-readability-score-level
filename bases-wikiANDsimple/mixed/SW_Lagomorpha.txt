Lagomorpha is a mammal order. It includes pikas, rabbits and hares. Although the the lagomorphs look like rodents, they are actually not because they have four incisors on the upper jaw, not two like in rodents, and they eat plants, not meat too, like rodents. They were classified under rodents until the 20th century. They are divided into two families, Leporidae, hares and rabbits, and Ochotonidae, the pikas.
