Yupi'k people are a group of native people who mainly reside in certain parts of Alaska, somewhere near Fairbanks. There is a very little population of Yupi'ks, near 500. Most of them were wiped out by a virus or sickness. Some of the Yupi'k people's traditions are celebrating the dead. They celebrate by having ceremonies with a shaman, where they connect with the dead. They also name the next child born after the most recent person who has died.
