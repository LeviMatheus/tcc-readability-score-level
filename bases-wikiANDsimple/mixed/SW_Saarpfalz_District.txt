Saarpfalz ("Saar-Palatinate") is a Kreis (district) in the south-east of the Saarland, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from west clockwise) Saarbrücken, Neunkirchen, Kusel, Südwestpfalz, district-free Zweibrücken, and the French "département" Moselle.
History.
When after World War I the Saar area went under special government of the League of Nations, the Palatinate area, then part of Bavaria, was split in two parts. The part which went into the Saar became commonly know as Saarpfalz, and was administrated by the two "Bezirksamt" St. Ingbert and Homburg. The district Saarpfalz was created in 1974 when the two districts Saint Ingbert and Homburg were joined. Since 1997 the district has partnership with the Henrico County, Virginia.
