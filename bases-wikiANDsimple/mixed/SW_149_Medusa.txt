149 Medusa is a bright-coloured, stony main belt asteroid.
It was found by J. Perrotin on September 21, 1875 and named after the Gorgon Medusa, a snake-haired monster in Greek mythology.
When it was found, Medusa was by far the smallest asteroid found (although this was not known at that time). Since then, many thousands of smaller asteroids have been found. It was also the closest asteroid to the Sun found up to that point, beating the long-held record of 8 Flora. It continued to be the closest asteroid to the Sun until 433 Eros and 434 Hungaria were found in 1898, leading to two new families of asteroids being found closer than the 4:1 Kirkwood gap which forms the edge of the main belt.
It has also a rather long rotation period of 26 hours.
