64 Studio is a free Linux distribution based on Debian made for creative users on x86-64 and legacy 32-bit hardware architectures. It is made to serve as an all-in-one solution for audio and video recording, editing, and other forms of media production.
Since 64 Studio is distributed with a free software license, anyone with a 64-bit computer can install it on their computer (in place of or alongside the well-known Windows operating system). An alternative installer is available for systems with 32-bit processors.
Differences with Debian.
The major differences between this distribution and basic Debian is a custom kernel with realtime patches applied, some pre-configuration and a custom package selection designed to meet the needs of creative desktop users. Other packages may also be modified to some extent, as are the basic GNOME desktop themes.
