56 Melete is a big and dark main belt asteroid. It is a rather unusual class P asteroid, it is probably made up of organic rich silicates, carbon and anhydrous silicates, with possible internal water ice. It was found by H. Goldschmidt on September 9, 1857 and was named after Melete, the Muse of meditation in Greek mythology. So far two stellar occultations by Melete have been seen successfully (in 1997 and again in 2002).
