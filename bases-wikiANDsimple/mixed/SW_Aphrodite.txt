Aphrodite (Greek 'risen from sea-foam') is the goddess of love and beauty in Greek mythology, and one of the Twelve Olympians. Many painters chose to paint her as a (more or less) naked woman.
Birth.
Aphrodite was born from sea-foam near Paphos, Cyprus. She appeared from the sea after Kronos cut off Uranos's genitals and threw them into the sea.
Marriage.
Aphrodite was very beautiful, which made Zeus, the god of the gods, afraid that she would be the cause of fights between the other gods. He therefore married Aphrodite to Hephaestus. Hephastus was happy to be married to Aphrodite and made her lots of jewelry. But Aphrodite did not like him, because he was very ugly, and went looking for other men. She spent most of her time with Ares, but was also linked with Adonis and Anchises.
