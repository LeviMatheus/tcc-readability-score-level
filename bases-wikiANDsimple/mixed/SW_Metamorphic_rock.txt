A metamorphic rock is a type of rock that is formed when its pre-existing rock is changed. It's name is derived from the the word "morph", meaning change.
That will happen if different temperature and pressure conditions than those in which the original rock was formed occur. These temperatures and pressures are always higher than those at the Earth's surface and must be sufficiently high that they change the original minerals into other mineral types or into other forms of the same minerals (e.g. by recrystallisation) under the pressure of Earth's crust over long periods of time.
Marble is a type of metamorphic rock.
