Public Ivy is a term started by Richard Moll in his 1985 book "Public Ivys: A Guide to America's best public undergraduate colleges and universities". The book is about universities which "provide an Ivy League collegiate experience at a public school price." Public Ivies are chosen, according to the "Journal of Blacks in Higher Education", to be able to be "successfully competing with the Ivy League schools in academic rigor... attracting superstar faculty and in competing for the best and brightest students of all races."
