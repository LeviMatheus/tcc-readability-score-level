God Save the Queen is a song, the national anthem of the United Kingdom. When there is a king instead of a queen it becomes God Save the King. Some other countries that still have the British monarch as their head of state use this song as a "Royal Anthem" to honour the queen.
It is not completely certain who wrote it, but most people think it was Dr Henry Carey, who first performed it in 1740.
The tune for God Save the Queen was used in many countries as a national anthem. Apart from the German state, many of which were linked to Great Britain by marriage, Liechtenstein and Switzerland used the tune. Switzerland changed to a different tune in the 1960s. Liechtenstein still uses the tune.
In the 1930s the United States chose an official anthem. The "Star Spangled Banner" was chosen instead of the equally popular "My Country 'tis of Thee" which used the God Save the Queen tune.
