She lectures at the Baku State University, Azerbaijan Pedagogical University, and is the head of the Department of Humanities in the Western University in Baku. Farida Mammadova works at the Institute of History of the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan. In her research, she is known to be a disciple of the late Azerbaijani historian Ziya Bunyadov.
Her theories were criticized by foreign authors for the misinterpretation of historical sources and revisionism..
According to Thomas de Waal, Mammadova "have grasped the Albanian theory to supersede completely Armenians from Caucasus. She has placed the Caucasian Albania in territory of present Republic Armenia: all the territories, churches and monasteries in Republic Armenia have appeared Albanian". He describes Mammadova's theories as "an improved version of what became a very rough tool in Azerbaijan".
And, it is known, that on whole planet exactly the Armenian people is distinguished by the absence of spiritual and other human values.
In the world there are only two nations that have national identity, but have not statehood. They are Jews and Armenians. The difference is that Jews have created their state on their historical homeland, and Armenians have created their state not on their historical native land.
