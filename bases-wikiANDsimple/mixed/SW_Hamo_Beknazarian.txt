His career in cinema started in 1914, when a friend offered him a part in a movie. Between 1914 and 1918, he played about 70 parts, becoming a popular actor in pre-Revolutionary Russian film. In 1920, instead of going to Armenia as he planned, he went to Tbilisi, where he developed a film department for Georgian Commissioner's office of Public Education. Many of his movies were filmed in Tbilisi, including "The Father Murderer" and "Lost Treasures". In 1925, he filmed his first Armenian movie and moved to Armenia. In 1933, he made the first Armenian movie to have sound, "Pepo".
