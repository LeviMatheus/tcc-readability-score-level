In 1937 the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) ordered a fleet of articulated electric multiple unit (EMU) passenger trains for use on the Tyneside Electric lines, which linked the English city of Newcastle upon Tyne with the coast at North Shields and South Shields. The order also included some single-unit motor parcel vans and motor luggage vans.
