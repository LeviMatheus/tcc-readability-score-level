History.
The municipality was first noted in 1171 as "Faedo".
In the spring of 2004, the people voted for merging the neighboring municipalities of Chiggiogna, Osco, Mairengo, Calpiogna, Campello, Rossura, Calonico, Anzonico, Cavagnago, and Sobrio. Most of the municipalities did not want to do that, and the new municipality contains only the municipalities of Faido, Chiggiogna, Rossura, and Calonico.
