Aaron Burr, Jr. (February 6, 1756, – September 14, 1836) was an American politician, Revolutionary War hero and adventurer. He was the third Vice President of the United States (1801 – 1805).
Burr fought in the American Revolutionary War, reaching the rank of Colonel.
Burr served in the New York State Assembly, as New York State Attorney General, and as a United States Senator before serving as Vice President.
Burr killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel in 1804, when Burr was still Vice President.
Burr conspired to form a new country in the southwest territories. He wanted to create a war with Spain to achieve that goal. Some people, including President Thomas Jefferson, who had picked a different Vice President for his second term, saw Burr's actions as treason. However, Burr was found innocent of the charges.
