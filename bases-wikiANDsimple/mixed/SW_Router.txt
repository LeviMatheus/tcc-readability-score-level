A router is a computer whose software and hardware are usually customized to perform tasks of routing and forwarding information. Routers generally contain a specialized operating system, RAM, NVRAM, flash memory, and one or more processors, as well as two or more network interfaces.
Routers connect two or more logical subnets, which do not necessarily map one-to-one to the physical interfaces of the router. The term layer 3 switch often is used interchangeably with router, but switch is really a general term without a precise technical definition; network switches are generally optimized for Ethernet LAN interfaces and may not have other physical interface types.
