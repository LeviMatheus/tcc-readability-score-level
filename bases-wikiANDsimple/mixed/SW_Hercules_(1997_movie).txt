Hercules is an animated Disney movie. It is based on the Greek legend of Hercules, but it is very different than the original story. It was more like Superman, Rocky and The Karate Kid. Unlike most Disney movies, it had a very different style due to the fact that the British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe, (who designed the movie, Pink Floyd The Wall) helped make the movie.
