A machine gun is a weapon that can fire one bullet after another as long as the trigger is pulled and there are bullets ready to fire. This is called automatic fire. Some machine guns can be carried by one person. Some machine guns have to be fired from a stand with three legs called a tripod. Many machine guns fire bullets connected together in a long chain called a belt. Others use spring loaded boxes called magazines.
Similar weapons that fire less powerful bullets are called sub-machine guns (SMG).
