A red-light district is a place where prostitution is legal or seen with tolerance. In the world there are many red-light districts, the most famous probably being the red-light district in Amsterdam. In the red-light district prostitutes are often helped and protected, and every month doctors visit them. Condoms are given to the prostitute so they don't catch any diseases. In some red-light districts prostitutes pay taxes, as in the red-light district of Amsterdam. In others places prostitutes don't pay taxes, because they are there illegaly and often put on the street with violence. In some part of Africa there are villages of prostitutes, where they live and work, because aren't accepted by the people of other villages.
