Def Leppard was one of the first hard rock bands in 1977. They formed in Sheffield, England in 1977. Its founding members include: Lead singer Joe Elliot, bassist Rick Savage, and guitarist Pete Willis. Drummer Rick Allen and guitarist Steve Clark joined the band shortly after.
Their debut album, "On Through the Night" (1980) was a hit in many parts of England. Two of their biggest selling albums are "Pyromania" (1983) and "Hysteria" (1987). During the recording of Pyromania, guitarist Willis was replaced with Phil Collen. Between the releases of Pyromania and Hysteria, drummer Allen lost his left arm in an automobile accident, and guitarist Clark died from an overdose of drugs and alcohol. After Allen re-learned to play the drums using a specially-made Simmons drum kit, the four remaining members released their next album, "Adrenalize" in 1992. Former Whitesnake guitarist Vivian Campbell joined the group for the following tour.
