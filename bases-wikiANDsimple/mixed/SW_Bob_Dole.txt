Robert Joseph Dole (born July 22, 1923) is a former United States Senator from Kansas. He was the Republican leader of the Senate from 1985 until 1996. In 1996, he ran against Bill Clinton for President, and lost. After that, he retired from politics at age 72.
In 1976, President Gerald Ford chose him to be his Vice Presidential choice for the November, 1976 election. They lost the election so Bob Dole never became Vice President.
Shortly after the 1996 election, he famously appeared in a Pepsi commercial, saying, "I just cannot win". He has also done commercials for Viagra.
Bob Dole has a habit of talking in the third person, or using his own name instead of "I" when he talks about himself. This habit is the basis for many jokes about Dole.
An episode of "The Simpsons" had Bob Dole in it. The episode takes place during the election of Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, and they get abducted by aliens.
