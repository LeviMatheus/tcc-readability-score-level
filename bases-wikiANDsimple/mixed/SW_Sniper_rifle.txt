A sniper rifle is a type of gun used to accurately shoot targets a long distance away.
A person who uses a sniper rifle in the military is called a sniper. Almost all sniper rifles use a scope, a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away. Sniper rifles come in two different kinds: bolt-action rifles, which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot, and semi automatic rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically readies the next shot for firing.
