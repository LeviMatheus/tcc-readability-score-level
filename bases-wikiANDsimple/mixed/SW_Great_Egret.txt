The Great Egret (also known an the Common Egret) is a large wading bird found worldwide. It is the second-largest member of the heron family in America (second only to the Great Blue Heron). It lives in mudflats, tidal shallows and marshes. It winters in the south down to Colombia. The Great Egret flies with slow wing beats and has a deep, croaking call. The scientific name of the Great Egret is "Casmerodius albus" (genus and species).
Diet.
The Great Egret eats fish, lizards, frogs, crayfish, small rodents, and insects. It often hunts in shallow water, usually impaling the prey on its long, sharp bill.
Egg and Nests.
