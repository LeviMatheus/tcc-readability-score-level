A curtain is a piece of cloth used to block light, water, or cold air from entering a place (some curtains are better at blocking then others because of the fabric). Curtains are hung around showers to keep water off the floor around the shower. Curtains are also hung around windows to keep light from coming in. Curtains can come in many different colors and different types of fabric.
