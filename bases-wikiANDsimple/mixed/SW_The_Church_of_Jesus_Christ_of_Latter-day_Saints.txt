The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) is the largest group in the Mormon movement. It was started in 1830 in New York by Joseph Smith. They believe that Joseph Smith was a prophet who restored the church Jesus Christ set up on earth when he was alive. They teach that they are the only church with a fullness of the gospel and that all others are incomplete. They also believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three separate individuals but all have the same mission. LDS scriptures include the Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. Members of the church are known for being active in missionary work. They also believe in the importance of families. The church's headquarters today are in Salt Lake City, Utah.
Beliefs and practices.
Today the center of the Church is in Utah, but there are more than 13 million members living all over the world. The leader of the Church is called the President, and Mormons call him a prophet. They believe that God guides the prophet, just like He guided Joseph Smith and the prophets in the Bible. Mormons believe that it is important for families to spend a lot of time together, and that after they die, they can live together forever. Mormons do not drink alcohol, coffee, tea, or smoke tobacco. They meet once a week on Sunday for church, where they have the sacrament and listen to short talks or sermons. They also have Sunday School to learn more. The Church also has activities during the week. Mormons also have buildings called temples. These are the most holy buildings in their religion. After a temple has been dedicated, only Mormons that are living good lives can go in the temple.
Missions.
An LDS mission is mainly for 19 year old boys, but 21 year old girls can also go. On a mission, LDS members go out to teach people who do not belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints about it. A mission usually lasts 2 years.
