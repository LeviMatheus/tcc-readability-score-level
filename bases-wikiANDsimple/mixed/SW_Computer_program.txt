A computer program is something that tells a computer what to do. Computer programs can be installed onto a computer. A web browser can be used to browse the Internet. An office suite can be used to write documents or spreadsheets. Crackers can secretly use a computer virus to gain access to a user's computer. Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer are examples of computer programs. They are both web browsers, which means that the user can view web pages using them. Adobe Flash is another example of a computer program. It allows the user to create animations or other computer programs.
A computer program is stored as a file on the user's hard drive. When the user runs the program, the file is read and the processor reads the data in the file as a list of commands or instructions. The computer then does what the program tells it to do.
A computer program is written by a programmer. It is very difficult to write in ones and zeroes, which is what the computer can read, so computer programmers write in a programming language. Once it is written, the programmer uses a compiler to turn it into a language that the computer can understand.
