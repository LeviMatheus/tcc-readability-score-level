Programming is when Computer programmers make programs. They usually use programming languages to make their programs. Sometimes they use special software which helps them to make programs, and sometimes they use simpler software like Notepad which only gives them a place to type. After they write programs, they use compilers to turn what they've typed, called the source code, into things that they can run, called executables.
