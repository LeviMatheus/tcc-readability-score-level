Alfred Lothar Wegener (November 1, 1880 â€“ November 2 or 3, 1930) was a German scientist and meteorologist. He was born in Berlin and in 1904 he earned his Ph.D in Astronomy at the University of Berlin. In 1914 he was put into the German army but released from battle after he was severely wounded. He is most notable for his theory of continental drift, proposed in 1912, which hypothesized that the continents were slowly drifting around the Earth. However, at the time he was unable to demonstrate a mechanism for this movement; this combined with not enough solid evidence meant that his hypothesis was not accepted until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries provided evidence of continental drift.
