One speaks of scale in context with measurement if something is represented proportionally by something else.
The scale of a map or enlarged or reduced model indicates the ratio between the distances on the map or model and the corresponding distances in reality or the original. E.g. a map of scale 1:50,000 shows a distance of 50,000 cm (=500 m) as 1 cm on a map, and a model on a scale 1:25 of a building with a height of 30 m has a model height of 1.20 m. An alternative method of indicating the scale is by a scale bar. This can also be applied on a computer screen etc., where the ratio may vary, and also remains valid when enlarging or reducing a paper map.
