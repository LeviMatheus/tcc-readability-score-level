498 Tokio is a minor planet orbiting the Sun.
Tokio was found by Shin Hirayama in Tokyo on March 6, 1900. However, he was not able to see where its orbit was. After it was refound by Auguste Charlois on December 2, 1902, Charlois gave Hirayama the honor of naming it. Hirayama chose to name it Tokio after the city by the same name ("Tokio" is an older romanization).
The size of Tokio is 85 km x 60 km (found out by the occultation in Japan on February 18, 2004). Its provisional name was 1902 KU.
