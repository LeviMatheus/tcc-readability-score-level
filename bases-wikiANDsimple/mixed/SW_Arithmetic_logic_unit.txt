In computing, an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is one of basic building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer, even the simplest microcontrollers contain one for purposes such timing.
Now, modern microprocessors, microcontrollers and CPUs have very powerful and very complex ALUs, also a CPUs may contain up to more than 4 ALUs (see superscalar CPUs).
Mathematician John von Neumann proposed the ALU concept in 1945.
