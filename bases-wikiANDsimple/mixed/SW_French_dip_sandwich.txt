The French dip sandwich is a popular dish. It is a sandwich, usually on French bread, with roast beef on the inside. It comes with a special sauce called "au jus" which is usually made with the juice and fat that came off the roast beef when they were cooking it. It was not originally from France; two restaurants in Los Angeles, California, "Cole's" and "Philippe's", both claim to have invented it.
