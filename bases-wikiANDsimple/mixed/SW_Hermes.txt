Hermes is the god of travellers and shepherds in Greek mythology. He is one of the Twelve Olympians and is the messenger of the gods.
Hermes is the son of Zeus and Maia. He was born on Mount Cyllene. The story of his birth was told in the Homeric Hymn, which means "Hyme to Hermes". It said the Maia was a nymph.
Hermes was very clever and on his first day invented the lyre, by using the shell of a tortoise.
