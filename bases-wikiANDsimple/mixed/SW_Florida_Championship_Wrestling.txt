It became their only developmental territory in early 2008 when they ended affiliation with Ohio Valley Wrestling.

A 21 man Battle Royal was held during the show, with Harry Smith booked to win and become the first ever FCW Southern Heavyweight Champion. The next year the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship was introduced, with Jake Hager becoming the first champion at a February 15 show after surviving a Battle Royal and defeating Ted DiBiase, Jr.. The FCW Florida Tag Team Championship was also introduced in February, with the Puerto Rican Nightmares (Eddie Col√≥n and Eric Perez) beating Steven Lewington and Heath Miller to win it in the finals of a one night tournament.
