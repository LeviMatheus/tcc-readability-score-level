The Wild Turkey ("Meleagris gallopavo") is the name of the more common of the two species of turkey (a large bird). They are found across much of the United States and southern Canada. Wild Turkeys are rather large, and sometimes hunted by people.
The "domesticated turkey" has been tamed and bred from wild turkeys, by people, to raise on farms.
