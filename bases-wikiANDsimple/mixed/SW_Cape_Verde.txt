Cape Verde is a country in Africa. It is a group of islands and its official language is Portuguese. During the 1970's and 1980's, other African countries would not let South African airplanes fly over their territory except Cape Verde. The country became an important stop where airplanes filled up their fuel tanks.
"Verde" means green in Portuguese.
