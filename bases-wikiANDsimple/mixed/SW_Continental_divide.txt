A continental divide is a line of elevated terrain which forms a border between two watersheds such that water falling on one side of the line eventually travels to one ocean or body of water, and water on the other side travels to another, generally on the opposite side of the continent. Because the exact border between bodies of water is usually not clearly defined, the continental divide is not always definite for any continent (The International Hydrographic Organization's publication "Limits of Oceans and Seas" defines exact boundaries of oceans, but it is not universally recognized). Moreover, some rivers empty into deserts or inland seas, and thus do not end up in the oceans.
