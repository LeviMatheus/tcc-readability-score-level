In the Western Christian calendar, Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent. It ends Carnival. It generally is 40 days before Easter. The date is different each year (because the date of Easter varies). Generally, it is between February 4 and March 10. In truth, there are 46 days between Ash Wednesday and Easter, but Sundays are not counted in this period.
Generally, those able to and willing should fast voluntarily between Ash Wednesday and Easter. There are exceptions, though. Pregnant women, those sick, children, and the old are generally excepted.
