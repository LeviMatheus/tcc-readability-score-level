90377 Sedna (or simply just Sedna) is a dwarf planet. When it was discovered in 2003, it was said to be the tenth planet. But due to Pluto no longer being classified as a planet, it is now classified as a dwarf planet like Pluto. It takes 90377 Sedna an amazing 10, 500 years to fully orbit the Sun.
