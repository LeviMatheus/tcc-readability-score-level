General Sir James Abbott (12 March 1807 â€“ 6 October 1896) was a British army officer in colonial India. He became famous in the northwest frontier region of India in the middle part of the 19th century (today this is the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan). He was one of Henry Lawrence's 'advisers' to the Sikhs, after the First Sikh War (1846), and then became the first deputy commissioner of Hazara (1849 - 1853).
As part of the Treaty of Lahore signed after the defeat of the Sikhs in the First Sikh War, Hazara and Kashmir were going to be transferred to Gulab Singh, Hazara however stayed under the Lahore government and governed by James Abbott. The Pakistani city of Abbottabad is named after him.
James Abbott was the brother of Augustus Abbott and Frederick Abbott. His picture was created by the artist B. Baldwin, this picture is located in the National Portrait Gallery in London, though it is not currently on display.
