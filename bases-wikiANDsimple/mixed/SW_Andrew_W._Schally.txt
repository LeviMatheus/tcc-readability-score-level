Andrzej Wiktor Schally, also known as Andrew W. Schally, born November 30, 1926 in Wilno, Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania). He is an endocrinologist and in 1977 won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Born in Poland, Andrew Schally received his education in Scotland and England. In 1952, he moved to Canada. He received his doctorate in endocrinology from McGill University in 1957. That same year he left for a research career in the United States where he has worked principally at Tulane University. A Canadian citizen when he left Canada, Schally became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1962. He was affiliated with the Baylor College of Medicine for some years in Houston, Texas.
He developed a whole new realm of knowledge concerning the brain’s control over the body chemistry. His works also addressed birth control methods and growth hormones. He - as well as Roger Guillemin- described the neurohormone GnRH that controls FSH and LH. He was awarded an honorary Doctoral Degree from Jagiellonian University at Kraków.
