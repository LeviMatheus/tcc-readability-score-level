The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued October 7, 1763, by King George III after Great Britain gained French territory in North America after the end of the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. The purpose of the Proclamation was to organize Britain's large North American empire, and to make relations with Native Americans better and more stable by controlling trade, settlement, and land purchases on the western frontier. The Proclamation basically said that Americans could not settle or buy land west of the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists were angry because many already had land in that area. Also, the Proclamation gave Great Britain a monopoly in land bought from Native Americans.etr
