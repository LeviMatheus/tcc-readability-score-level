John Caldwell Calhoun (March 18, 1782 â€“ March 31, 1850) was the vice-president for Andrew Jackson, an American President. Calhoun is probably best remembered for his strong belief in supporting nullification, which said any US state had the right to reject a federal law if it wanted to. Jackson hated nullification and the disagreement that started the feud between him and President Andrew Jackson!
