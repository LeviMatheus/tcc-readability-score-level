The British Rail Class 119 DMUs were used on the Western Region and on services in the Midlands that used units that were based at Tyseley Depot. Soon after they were introduced, many of the DMUs were moved to Cardiff. This was so that they could serve the intermediate stations on outer suburban services from London Paddington to Oxford. These were as 7-car sets, with the addition of Hawksworth composites adapted to run as DMU trailers.
