121 Hermione is a very big asteroid of the dark C spectral type, orbiting in the Cybele group in the farther part of the main belt. As a C-type, it is probably made of carbonate.
Hermione was found by J. C. Watson on May 12, 1872, and named after Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and Helen in Greek mythology. Hermione is a Cybele asteroid and orbits beyond most of the main belt asteroids.
The asteroid has an odd shape, as evidenced by adaptive optics images, the first of which were taken in December 2003, with the Keck telescope. Of many proposed shape models that agreed with the images, a "snowman"-like shape was found to best fit the seen precession rate of Hermione's moon.
Observation of the moon's orbit has made possible a correct determination of Hermione's mass. For the best-fit "snowman" model, the density is found to be 1.8 ± 0.2 g/cm³, giving a porosity of the order of 20%, and possibly indicating that the main asteroids are fractured solid bodies, but that the asteroid is rather not a rubble pile (an asteroid that has been broken up by a collision and pulled back together by gravity).
Occultations by Hermione have been successfully seen three times so far, the last time in February, 2004.
Moon (S/2002 (121) 1).
A moon of Hermione was found in 2002 with the Keck II telescope. The moon is currently designated S/2002 (121) 1. It has not yet been officially named, but "LaFayette" has been suggested by a group of astronomers in reference to the frigate used in secret by the Marquis de Lafayette to reach America to help the insurgents.
