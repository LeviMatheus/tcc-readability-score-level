728 Leonisis is an asteroid of the Flora family, found by Johann Palisa in 1912 in Vienna. Its provisional name was 1912 NU.
Astronomers are not sure what its spectral class is. It has been previously placed in the rare A and L classes. These are generally "stony" spectra, but with significant differences from the usual S-type. The unusual spectrum brings Leonisis' membership in the Flora family into doubt.
