Je (Ј, ј) is a letter of the Cyrillic alphabet, used in the Serbian, Macedonian, Azeri, and Altai languages.
In Serbian, Macedonian and Azeri this letter is sounded as [j]. Since the letters Я (ya), Є (ye), Ё (yo), Ї (yi) and Ю (yu) are not used in those languages, they are written as as Ja, Je, Jo, Jи and Jy.
It is also used in the Altai language to show [ʤ].
