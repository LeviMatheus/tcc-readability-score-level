Frank Sinatra (December 12, 1915 â€“ May 14, 1998) was an American singer and actor. His singing career was almost seventy years long and more than 250 million records of his have been sold worldwide. Sinatra's style of music, the way he sang, is hard to define. In slang terms he was a "crooner", a singer of love ballads. He has also been called a "jazz singer" because of his work with famous jazz musicians and his use of jazz in his music.
Sinatra was also part of the Rat Pack, a group of entertainers (musicians and actors), in the 1950s and 1960s. The name was informal, or slang, and the group was not an official organization of any sort, but a group of friends. Members of the Rat Pack included Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Peter Lawford, Joey Bishop, Humphrey Bogart, Judy Garland, Lauren Bacall, Sid Luft and Shirley MacLaine among others.
Sinatra was friends with many important entertainers, politicians and mafia members. Because he had friends in the mafia the FBI tried to find information that could have him arrested.
