Peer pressure is a force that occurs within a group of people. It commonly occurs to children during puberty. The group has defined some social values. To stay accepted within the group, to stay "cool" the idea is to be like most people in that group. Social pressure (and wanting to be accepted or in favor inside the group) leads people to do things they would not do otherwise. For example, it can make a person to smoke cigarettes or marijuana, to drink alcohol, commit crimes, and/or many other things.
