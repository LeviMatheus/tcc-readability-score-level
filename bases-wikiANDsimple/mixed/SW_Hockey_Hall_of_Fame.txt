The Hockey Hall of Fame ("Temple de la renomm√©e du hockey" in French) is located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It's main subject is the history of ice hockey, it is both a museum and a hall of fame. It holds displays about players, teams, National Hockey League (NHL) records, and NHL trophies, including the Stanley Cup. First opened in Kingston, Ontario, the Hockey Hall of Fame was first began in 1943 by James T. Sutherland. The first group of members was selected in 1945, before the Hall of Fame had a permanent location. It moved to Toronto in 1958 after the NHL took away its support for the Kingston location. Its first permanent building opened at Exhibition Place in 1961. Because the Hall was getting too big for its location, it was moved to an old Bank of Montreal building in downtown Toronto in 1993, where it is currently located.
