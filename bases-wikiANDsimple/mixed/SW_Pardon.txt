A Pardon is what a President or other important political person "gives" to someone who has been put in jail or taken to court. Whoever gets this pardon is free and not guilty anymore.
Usually Presidents give these right when they are about to leave and cannot be elected again, because sometimes people get very angry at the President for pardoning criminals.
