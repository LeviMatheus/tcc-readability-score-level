But, it was decided by Star Cruises that SuperStar Libra and SuperStar Scorpio would enter service as part of the fleet operated by subsidiary company Norwegian Cruise Line. These vessels would become Norwegian Star and Norwegian Dawn. In 2002, Norwegian Dawn was delivered to NCL. It is the second SuperStar.
