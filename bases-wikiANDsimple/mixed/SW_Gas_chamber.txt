A gas chamber is an airtight room used for killing people or animals by means of gas. The gas used is either poisonous, or it causes asphyxiation. The people or animals are put into the gas chamber, the door is sealed airtight from the outside, and a gas, such as carbon monoxide or hydrogen cyanide, is put into the chamber. The victims die from choking (asphyxiation) from being made to breathe the poisonous gas.
The gas chamber was invented in Nevada, United States in 1929, as the government of Nevada did not want to use an electric chair and considered hanging to be cruel and inhumane. The gas chambers became notoriously infamous in the Nazi Germany as they were first used in the "T-4" programme (killing disabled people) and then in the Holocaust for mass murdering of Jews, Gypsies and other people that the Nazis did not like.
The United States Supreme Court decided that the gas chamber is a cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by the constitution in 1999. Death from hydrogen cyanide poisoning can take up to fifteen minutes. It is extremely painful and terrifying. The witnesses and reporters who had seen people getting executed in the gas chamber said that death in the gas chamber is sheer torture. It is no longer used in any of those states which still have the death penalty.
