Kamala Nehru Park is a park in India. It covers an area of 4,000 sq yd (3,300 mÂ²). It is located at the top of Mumbai's Malabar Hill. The park is named after Kamala Nehru, the wife of India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.
A place often visited by schoolchildren, it has little to offer by way of entertainment apart from a structure shaped like a shoe. The shoe structure is inspired by the nursery rhyme "There was an old woman."
From the garden, one can see Chowpatty Beach, and the Queen's Necklace (Marine Drive).
