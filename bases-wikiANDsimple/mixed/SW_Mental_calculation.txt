Mental Calculation or Mental Math is a very old mathematical tool. It is doing math without using any objects or writing anything, instead doing it "in your head" as English-speakers say. Mental Math uses a lot of shortcuts. You can see that 2+2 is 4. But most people need a shortcut to see that 20% of 60 is 12. To get 20 percent of a number you can divide it by 5 (60/5=12).
