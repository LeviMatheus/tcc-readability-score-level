"Majulah Singapura" (Malay for "Onward Singapore") is the national anthem of Singapore. It was composed by Zubir Said in 1958 as a song to be sung at official events arranged by the City Council of Singapore. In 1959, the song was chosen as Singapore's anthem when it got the right to rule itself. When Singapore became a fully independent nation in 1965, "Majulah Singapura" was formally taken on as Singapore's national anthem.
Singapore law says that the anthem may only be sung with its original Malay lyrics. However, there are government-approved translations of the lyrics in Singapore's three other official languages: English, Mandarin and Tamil.
The national anthem is regularly performed or sung in schools and military camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day. At these ceremonies, the national flag is also raised and lowered, and the national pledge is said.
Singaporeans are encouraged to sing the national anthem during times of national celebration or at important national events such as at the National Day Parade, at National Day observance ceremonies held by government departments and educational institutions such as schools and universities, and at sports events that Singapore teams take part in.
