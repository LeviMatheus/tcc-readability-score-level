Bob Baker (October 26, 1926 - April 23, 2002) was an American boxer. He was one of the world's leading heavyweight boxers in the 1950's. Bob "The Grinder" Baker was born in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He started fighting out of Pittsburgh. His most notable accomplishments include the 1949 Pennsylvania Intercity Golden Gloves championship in the heavyweight division. Baker started his professional career with twenty-six straight victories before drawing against Kid Riviera and losing the next fight to another good boxer, Clarence Henry.
From August 1955 until February of 1956, Baker and Archie Moore were both ranked as the leading challengers to Rocky Marciano's heavyweight title. On Wednesday, December 7th, 1955, Baker beat Nino Valdez.
After 13 wins, Baker lost to Tommy Hurricane Jackson on February 3, 1956, in New York's Madison Square Garden. It was a split decision win for Jackson. In May 1956, Baker easily defeated John Holman. Baker also lost another split decision rematch with Jackson on September 26, 1956. Opinions on both Baker-Jackson fights were divided in many publications with most of them giving the fight to Baker. The September match was given to Baker by The United Press. It scored the fight 7-5 for Baker. A poll of 13 ringside writers favored Baker 9-4 and it reported that many of the fans were very surprised with the split decision.
After 1956, Baker's success was limited. His most notable victory was a sound defeat of Canadian George Chuvalo, the future Canadian heavyweight champion, by unanimous decision on September 9, 1957. Chuvalo was also a multiple time top contender in the 1960s and 1970s.
Baker died on April 23, 2002, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
