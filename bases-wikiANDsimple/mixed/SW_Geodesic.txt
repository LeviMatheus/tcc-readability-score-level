In mathematics a geodesic is a curve with the shortest length between two places on a surface. On the flat surface there are only one such path between any two points. In a sphere two antipodal points (points opposite each other on a sphere such as the North Pole and South Pole on Earth) have an infinite number of such paths between them. These paths on the sphere are also called great circles.
