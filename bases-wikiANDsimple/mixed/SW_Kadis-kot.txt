Kadis-kot is a fictional board game in the TV show "Star Trek". It is played on a six-sided board with three sets of coloured stones.
The characters of Naomi Wildman and Seven of Nine played the game sometimes, after the events of the episode "Infinite Regress". A decent summary of the game can be found at.
