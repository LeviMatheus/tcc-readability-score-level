Ion Ivanovici (alternatively, Iosif Ivanovici, Josef Ivanovici, baptised as Jovan Ivanović) (born 1845 in Timişoara, died September 28, 1902 in Bucharest) was a Romanian military band leader and composer.
Today Ivanovici is especially remembered for his waltz "The Waves of the Danube", Donauwellen in German, in his lifetime he composed over 350 dances, and his works were published by over sixty publishing houses throughout the world. In 1889, Ivanovici won the much-desired march prize to mark the World Exhibition in Paris, out of 116 entries.
Ivanovici's Dabube Waves was first published in the U.S. in 1896, and republished in 1903, by the Theodore Lohr Company in an arrangement for piano by Simon Adler. The published version was called "Waves of the Danube". The composition is most commonly known as "Danube Waves Waltz".
