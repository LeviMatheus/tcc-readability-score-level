It is located in the central mountain range at 31 km to northwest of the city of “Cartago" with a height of 3,435 meters above sea level. It is one of the most visited country`s areas by tourists, both national and international, turning "Cartago" into one of the most popular provinces of Costa Rica.
Irazu Volcano National Park offers many types of craters, some having small lakes. It is an interesting fact because the volcano has more than one attraction; so many people can enjoy the attractive of the park. The park also protects 2,309 hectares of cloud and rain forest that means that the park also is a protected area and it takes care of the natural resources of the country such as paths to explore, leading to the craters and a majestic waterfall. From the highest point in the park, on a clear day, you can see both, the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea at the same time.
The vegetation of the park has been changing by the constant eruptions, but in the same way it is very beautiful and diverse. One of the most important and surprising irregularities of this natural resource is that the area where all the vegetation takes place is at the top of the volcano. This characteristic makes the “Irazu Volcano National Park" one of the most incredible and beautiful places around the country.
The wildlife is very little, but you can see several species both of birds and mammals. There is little animal diversity because of the low temperatures that exist at the summit of the volcano, but mostly "woodpeckers" and “coyotes” can be found.
