Prairie dogs are not dogs at all. They are small, burrowing rodents - a type of ground squirrel. Prairie dogs live in short-grass prairies and mountain plains of the western USA and Mexico. The explorers Lewis and Clark sent a prairie dog to President Thomas Jefferson during their expedition; it was quite an oddity to them.
Diet.
Prairie dogs are mostly herbivores (plant-eaters). They eat grasses, seeds, leaves, flowers, fruit, eggs, and some insects.
Predators.
Prairie dogs are hunted by many animals, including wolves, dogs, coyotes, bobcats, foxes, and humans.
