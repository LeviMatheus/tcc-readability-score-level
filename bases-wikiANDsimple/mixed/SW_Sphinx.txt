A sphinx is a mythological figure, which looks like a lion with a human head. It dates back to the Old Kingdom of Egypt, and its name comes from the Ancient Greek name for a "stranger". The spinx is also common in South and South-East Asia, and was popular in Europe from the times of the Renaissance.
