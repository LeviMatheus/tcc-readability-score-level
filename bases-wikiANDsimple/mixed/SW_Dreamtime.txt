In Australian Aborigine religion, the Dreamtime, also called The Dreaming, had four parts: The beginning of everything; the life and power of the ancestors; the way of life and death; and power in life. Dreamtime was all four of these things at the same time because it is more powerful than time and space. In it all things exist at once. The aborigines call Dreamtime the all-at-once time because they think it is the past, present, and future at the same time.
They meet The Dreamtime by doing special dances and singing special songs. The aborigines believe that people have a part of them that will live forever. This part existed before a person was born and will exist after they die. It exists in The Dreamtime. All Australian Aborigines believe in the Dreamtime. Each tribe has stories that say things about it. Most Aborigines believe that all life is connected to the great spirit ancestors of the Dreamtime.
The expression Dreamtime is often used to describe the time before time, or the time of the creation.
