22 Kalliope is a big main belt asteroid of the M-type, found by J. R. Hind on November 16, 1852. It is named after Calliope, the Greek Muse of epic poetry.
Characteristics.
Kalliope is somewhat stretched, approximately 180 km in diameter, and slightly asymmetric, as evidenced by resolved images taken with the VLT at the European Southern Observatory.
While its spectrum is an M-type, Kalliope does not appear to be metallic, similarly to other M-types such as 21 Lutetia, for example. Firstly, its density, which is known with confidence from its moon's orbit, is far too low to agree with any plausible metallic substance. Furthermore, spectroscopic studies have shown evidence of hydrated minerals and silicates, which indicate that the surface is stony. Kalliope also has a low radar albedo, which is again inconsistent with a metallic surface.
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Kalliope's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (-23°, 20°) with a 10° uncertainty, which gives Kalliope an axial tilt of 103°. Kalliope's rotation is then a bit retrograde.
Moon.
Kalliope has one known moon, Linus, or (22) Kalliope I Linus. It is quite big being 30-40 km in diameter, and would be a sizeable asteroid by itself. It orbits about 1065 km from Kalliope, equal to about 12 Kalliope radii. Linus was found on August 29, 2001 by Jean-Luc Margot and Michael E. Brown, while another team also independently detected the moon 3 days later.
