Abbey Road Studios, usually called just "Abbey Road", are the recording studios located inside EMI's headquarters in St. John's Wood, London, England.
Abbey Road had three different studios for most of its history. Other space was turned into a fourth studio later. Studio One is large, and used to be a ballroom. Symphony orchestras and very large bands and groups are recorded there. Studio Two is smaller, and works best for small combos or groups of musicians. Studio Three is much smaller, and is meant for soloists and duos. Studio Four is mostly for post-production, where changes are made to earlier recordings.
The studios are famous for the many great and popular songs and albums recorded there. The Beatles are the most famous recording artists to work at Abbey Road. They made the studios well-known when they talked to the media, about the music they made there. The Beatles even titled their last album "Abbey Road", after the studio location. They mostly recorded in Studio Two, but used One and Three also.
