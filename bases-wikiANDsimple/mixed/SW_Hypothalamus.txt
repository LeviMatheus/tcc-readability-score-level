Hypothalamus is a gland that is located at the base of the brain. It connects the endocrine system to the nervous system. The word "hypothalamus" is a Greek word which means "under the thalamus"; it is used because hypothalamus is located below the thalamus, and above the brain stem.
The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, thirst and circadian cycles.
