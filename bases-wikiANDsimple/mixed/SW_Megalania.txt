"Megalania" ("Varanus prisca") was a giant monitor lizard in southern Australia during the last 2 million to 40,000 years. It was related to the living Perenti and Gould's Goanna, but was much larger - their maximum length was at least 5.5 metres and their maximum weight about 600 kg. This is twice the length of their closest living relative, the Komodo dragon of eastern Indonesia.
