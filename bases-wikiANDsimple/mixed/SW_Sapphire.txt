Sapphire is the non-red type of the mineral corundum, an aluminium oxide (Al2O3). It can be found naturally or it can be made in large crystal. Blue sapphires are the most famous kind, but they can be of many different colors, like amber and orange.
Sapphires have long history. Tradition says that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were made of sapphire, so strong a hammer could not break them, and would break instead if it hit them. The ancient Persians believed that the earth lied on a giant sapphire and its reflection colored the sky. Many other cultures believe that sapphires could be used to heal and calm people.
Sapphires have been used by royalty throughout the ages as a symbol of good fortune, virtue, wisdom and holiness. Princess Diana and Princess Anne both received sapphire engagement rings and the British Crown Jewels are full of large blue sapphires, the symbol of pure and wise rulers.
Sapphire is the birthstone of September. It symbolizes sincerity and faithfulness.
