Flamenco is a style of guitar playing that originated in Spain by Gypsy people who were living there at the time. It is usually played on an acoustic (non-electric) guitar and accompanied by Flamenco dancers who are famous for their elaborate costumes.
The dance is very fast and you move your feet a lot.
