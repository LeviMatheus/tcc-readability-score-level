Phycology (or algology), a part of botany, is the study of algae. Algae are important as plants in aquatic ecosystems. Most algae are eukaryotic, photosynthetic organisms that live in a wet environment. They are different from the higher plants by a lack of "normal" roots, stems or leaves. Many types have one cell and are very small or microscopic (including plankton and other algae); many others are have many cells, some of these being very big, like seaweeds such as kelp and "Sargassum".
Phycology is also the study of prokaryotic forms known as blue-green algae or cyanobacteria. Some microscopic algae are also in Lichens.
A "phycologist" is a person who studies phycology.
