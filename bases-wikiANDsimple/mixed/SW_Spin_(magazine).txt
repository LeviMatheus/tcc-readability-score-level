"Spin" is a music magazine that competes with the leading magazine "Rolling Stone". Bob Guccione, Jr. created the magazine in 1985 and sold it to Miller Publishing in 1997. In February 2006, Miller Publishing sold the magazine for less than US$5 million to a San Francisco-based company called the McEvoy Group LLC. That company formed Spin Media LLC as a holding company. The new owners replaced the editor-in-chief Sia Michel with Andy Pemberton, who was once an editor at "Blender". The first issue to be published once he took over was the July 2006 issue—sent to the printer in May 2006—which had Beyoncé on the cover. Pemberton left "Spin" in June 2006. The current editor-in-chief is Doug Brod, who was executive editor from May 2003, and became editor-in-chief in January 2007.
