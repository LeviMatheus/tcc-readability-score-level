A tornado is a tube of spinning air that touches the ground. Wind inside the tornado, spinning very fast, makes tornadoes very dangerous.
Tornadoes mostly happen during very strong thunderstorms called supercell storms. They cause a lot of damage to anything they touch. People die every year from tornadoes.
Tornadoes are ranked on the Fujita scale, from F0 to F5. F0 has the lowest wind speed, and F5 has the highest wind speed.
The United States of America has the most tornadoes every year, but tornadoes can happen in any country. If a tornado is coming, the safest thing to do is go to a basement or a bathroom with no windows. People should never be in a car or a mobile home when there is a tornado near.
