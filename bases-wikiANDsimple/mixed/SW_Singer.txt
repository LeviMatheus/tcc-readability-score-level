A singer is a person who sings. Anyone who is singing is a singer. Some people do it as a job (professional singer), others may sing without being paid (amateur singer). Singers may sing anything: songs, opera etc. They may be accompanied by an instrument or an orchestra. Some singers also play a musical instrument such as piano, guitar or harp while they sing (they accompany themselves). Singing is important in movies and in the theatre.
A good singer will have to think of a lot of different things in a performance. Good vocal technique, a large vocal range, as well as "feeling the song" through emotional language and breathing, and also acting to provide a song with meaning. A good singer may be able to learn a song quickly, but it may take some time before they really feel it has become "part of them".
Singers can sing as a solo, or in a group or a choir. Choirs can include gospel, church music and even pop songs where there are usually two groups of singers, soprano and alto. Sopranos have a higher range and altos have a lower range. Combining these to can create various harmonies which add textures to songs and make them more interesting for the ear.
People who want a career in singing should start young. This means having lots of experience in music, including being able to read music and learning to make music with others. Serious vocal training can only begin when the body is more mature (mid- or late teenager).
Some of the reasons that people sing are to express the way they are feeling at the time, or something bad could have happened that they want to share, or something good could have happened. Singing is an art in which mood is expressed through the voice.
