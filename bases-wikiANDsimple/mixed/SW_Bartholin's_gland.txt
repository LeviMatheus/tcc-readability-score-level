The Bartholin's glands are two glands found slightly below and to the left and right of the opening of the vagina in women.
History.
They were first found in the 17th century, by the Danish anatomist, Caspar Bartholin the Younger (1655-1738).
Anatomy.
The glands secrete mucus to provide make sexual intercourse easier. Bartholin's glands secrete relatively minute amounts (one or two drops) of fluid when a woman is sexually aroused.
Sometimes, the Bartholin's glands become infected and can be swollen or painful. This can be treated by a doctor with antibiotics.
