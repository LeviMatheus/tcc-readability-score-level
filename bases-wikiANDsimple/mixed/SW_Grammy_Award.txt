The Grammy Awards (first named the Gramophone Awards and often called just Grammys), are awards given yearly by the Recording Academy (an association of Americans professionally involved in the recorded music industry) for outstanding work in the music and spoken recording industry. The Grammys have 108 categories with 30 genres. The Grammys happen every year but no one really seems to care about them
