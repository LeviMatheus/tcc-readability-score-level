An engine, or motor, is a machine for converting thermal energy into mechanical energy or power to produce force and motion. For example a car (automobile) has an engine which turns the wheels. An engine needs some kind of energy source, like gasoline (petrol), to work.
Cars make use of an internal combustion engine. There are different types of internal combustion engines; such as petrol/gasoline engines, diesel engines, rotary engines, four-stroke as well as two-stroke engines. The first internal combustion engine that worked was built by a German engineer named Nikolas Otto in 1876. Most cars have either four, six or eight cylinder motors. Modern cars, due to gas prices going up, may make use of three cylinders. For the best power, cars may even make use of sixteen cylinder motors.
External combustion also exists. An example is the steam engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine to create steam, which is used within the motor to bring about motion. These engines are commonly used in old boats or trains.
