Etymology.
"Cannolo" is a diminutive of "canna", 'cane' or 'tube'.
In Italian, "cannoli" is grammatically plural; the corresponding singular is "cannolo" (, ), meaning "little tube". In English, "cannoli" is usually used as a singular, and "cannolo" is rare.
History.
Some food historians place the origins of cannoli in 827-1091 AD in Caltanissetta, the City of Women, by the concubines of princes looking to capture the prince's attention. 
Author Gaetano Basile merged this legend with other historical traditions to determine that cannoli come from the Palermo and Messina areas and were historically prepared as a treat during Carnevale season, possibly as a fertility symbol. The dessert eventually became a year-round staple in Sicily.
Some similar desserts in Middle Eastern tradition include "Zainab's fingers", which are filled with nuts, and "qanawāt", deep fried dough tubes filled with various sweets, which were a popular pastry across the ancient Islamic world. The dish and the name may originate from the Muslim Emirate of Sicily. The "Minne Di Sant'Agata" or Minni di Virgini, cheese filled half spheres with icing and fruit are shaped like a breast in honour of St Agatha. "Feddi ru Cancillieri" is a similar cream and apricot jam filled almond cookie designed to look like the rear of a leader.
