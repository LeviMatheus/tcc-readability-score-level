The Manx language, (known in Manx as "Gaelg" or "Gailck"), is a language spoken in the Isle of Man.
It is a Celtic language of the Goidelic language family. It is in the same family as Scottish and Irish.
Manx is spoken mainly by people who learn it through interest. It died out as a natural community language in the 20th century. The last of the old native speakers died in 1974.
History.
Manx was beginning to differ from Middle Irish in about 900 - 1600 AD, and it is called Yn Ghaelg / Yn Ghailck by Manx speakers. There became fewer and fewer Manx speakers during the 19th century and the language was replaced by English. In 1901, 9% of the people in the Isle of Man were said to speak Manx but in 1921 the number dropped to only 1%.
Today, Manx is used as the only language taught at five of the Isle of Manâ€™s pre-schools. Manx is taught as a 2nd language at all of the Island's primary and secondary schools.
Manx today.
There is now 1 school that teaches all of its lessons in Manx. The census of 2001 said that 2.2% of the population of the island could speak the language. There are currently 54 first language Manx speakers.
