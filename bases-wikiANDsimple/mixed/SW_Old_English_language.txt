The Old English language was spoken in England from 450 to 1100. It is an old form of the English language that was spoken by people who came to England from what is now Germany and Denmark.
Old English is very different from Modern English; it has many more Germanic words, and its grammar is much harder and closer to German and Latin. Old English slowly turned into Middle English after the Normans invaded and stopped it from being taught in schools for around 300 years
