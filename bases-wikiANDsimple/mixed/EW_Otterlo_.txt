Otterlo (municipality of Ede) is a small village in the province of Gelderland in the Netherlands, in or near the Nationaal Park De Hoge Veluwe.

Otterlo was a separate municipality until 1818, when it merged with Ede.
Second World War.
During the first four years of the war, Otterlo was relatively unharmed. The local resistance made use of a secret telephone connection from a electrician house, which in 2021 still stands at the dorpsstraat, behind barber Prophitius, to communicatie with the allies below the river Rhine (1944/1945). During the war, multiple families were hiding jewish people from the Germans. One location was betrayed however, resulting in a razzia in 1944 at the house 'De Lindenhof' at the Hoenderlooseweg. 
During the liberation in april 1945, Otterlo became the epicenter of a fierce and bloody battle by coincidence, between German and British and Canadian soldiers. See the Battle of Otterlo.
