The Fulda is a river in Hesse, Germany. It is one of two headstreams of the Weser River (the other one being the Werra). The Fulda River is 218 km in length.
The source is in the Rhön mountains. From here it runs northwards through the Weserbergland hills and finally meets the Werra River close to Hannoversch Münden.
