The Brothers Grimm (German: "Die Brüder Grimm", also "Gebrüder Grimm") were the brothers Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm. They were German academics and most famous for their collections of folk tales and fairy tales, and for their work in linguistics.
The Grimm brothers both became linguists. They are the inventors of German philology. They also did other language-related work, like publishing one of the first grammar books for the German language.
They also collected fairy tales, and wrote down the tales which people told them. They published a collection of fairy tales known as "Grimm's Fairy Tales" ("Grimms Märchen").
