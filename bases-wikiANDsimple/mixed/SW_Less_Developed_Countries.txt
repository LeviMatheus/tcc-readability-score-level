Less Developed Countries or "LDC"s are those countries that are not as rich as the industrialised countries of western Europe and North America.
These are often countries which have a lot of natural resources but not the industry to use them so the resources are sold to the countries which can use them.
They are not used now because "Less Developed Country" seems less insulting.
