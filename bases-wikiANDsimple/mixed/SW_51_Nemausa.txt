51 Nemausa is a big Main belt asteroid made up with similar stuff as 1 Ceres. It was found in the city of Nîmes, France, after which it was named (in its Latin name). The person who found Nemausa was a certain "A. Laurent" who never found anymore asteroids and about whom not much seems to be known. The asteroid was found using the private observatory at the house formerly occupied by Benjamin Valz, who left to become the new director of the Marseille Observatory. He entrusted his former observatory to A. Laurent, who later found the asteroid. The house, at 32 rue Nationale in Nîmes, has a plaque commemorating the discovery.
A small moon has been suggested based on lightcurve data.
