Melodrama is a portmanteau word, formed by combining the words "melody" from the Greek "melōidía", meaning "song") and "drama". Melodrama is a Victorian style play with very simple characters: a villan, hero and heroine (which usually ends happy). In English, it is called a musical. Musicals are very popular among the people of the United States.
