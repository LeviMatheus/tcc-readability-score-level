The Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas is a building in Madrid, Spain used mainly for bullfighting. Sometimes it is just called Las Ventas. It is made of red brick and ceramic tiles. It was built in 1929 by José Espelious and Muñoz Monasterio. The first bullfight was June 17, 1931. It is also used for concerts.
Most fights start at 7 p.m. when the sun is not too hot. Tickets are sold for 'sol' or 'sombra'. The 'sombra' tickets for seats not in the sunlight cost more.
