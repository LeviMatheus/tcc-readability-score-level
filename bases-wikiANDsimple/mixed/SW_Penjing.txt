Penjing (盆景 pinyin: pén jǐng, literally tray scenery) is the ancient Chinese art of growing trees and plants. The plants are kept small by skilled pruning. People make them create a nice shape. People may also make them look old. Penjing is very similar to (and came before) the Japanese art of bonsai.
