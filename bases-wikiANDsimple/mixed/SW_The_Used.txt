The Used are an American Emo band. They formed in the year 2000 and have released a number of albums since then. Their first album was called Maybe Memories. Their latest album is called Lies for the liars, and was released in 2007.
They have always been signed to one record label named Reprise. In 2004, singer McCracken's girlfriend at the time was pregnant with their child and she died from a drugs overdose.
