Malcolm X was an African American nationalist and civil rights activist. At first, his actions and speeches were mostly inspired by the beliefs and teachings of the Nation of Islam. Once he learned that the leader of the "Nation of Islam" was in many relationships with women, he changed his religion to Sunni Islam. At this point, his opinions of white people got better and he soon knew that white people can be good people, too. "Malcolm X" was shot dead in New York City on February 21, 1965, on the first day of the National Brotherhood Week. Most people think that the "Nation of Islam" had a part in his murder. Malcolm X believed the end justified the means, so he believed violence was a necessary part in the fight for equality.
