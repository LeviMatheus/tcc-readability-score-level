The Glorious Revolution was an event in the history of England in 1688. The people of England didn't like the king, King James II because he wouldn't let them vote or worship God in the way they wanted to. They invited William III of Orange-Nassau to take over as king. William was King James II's nephew and Mary's first cousin. He came to England with his wife Queen Mary, the daughter of King James II. They let the old king escape, so he moved to France out of fear.
William signed the "Bill of Rights" and became king, and England became a constitutional monarchy.
