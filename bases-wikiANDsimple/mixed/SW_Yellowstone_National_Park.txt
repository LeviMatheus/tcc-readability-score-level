Yellowstone National Park was the first national park in the world. It was created on March 1, 1872 when United States President Ulysses S. Grant signed a law to create it.
Yellowstone National Park is famous for its geysers and hot springs. The world's most cool geyser, the Old Faithful Geyser, is in Yellowstone National Park. It also is a home for grizzly bears, wolves, bison and elk. Many tourists visit the park each year to see the geysers and animals there.
