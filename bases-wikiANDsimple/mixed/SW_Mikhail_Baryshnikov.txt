Mikhail Nikolaevitch Baryshnikov (Russian: Михаил Николаевич Барышников) (b January 27, 1948) is a Russian dancer, choreographer, and actor. He is often called the world's greatest living male ballet dancer. Critic Clive Barnes once called him, "The most perfect dancer I have ever seen.". While on a tour in Canada with the Kirov Ballet in 1974, Baryshnikov asked for political asylum in Toronto. He became an American citizen in 1986, and one of the most successful ballet dancers of all times. He won three Emmy Awards.
