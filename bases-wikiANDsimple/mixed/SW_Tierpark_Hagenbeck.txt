Tierpark Hagenbeck (Literally: Animal park Hagenbeck) is the name of the largest zoo in Hamburg, Germany. The park was founded by Carl Hagenbeck in 1907. His father was a fishmonger (a person who buys and sells fish). It is the first zoo in the world to use moats (a moat is a large hole or trench. Animals do not dare cross it).
This was done instead of using cages with bars, so the animals would feel more at home.
Bombs in the Second World War completely destroyed the zoological garden. With much help from the founding family, it was rebuilt after the war. Two Indian Elephants helped to clear the rubble in the zoo, and the city of Hamburg.
