WrestleMania III was the third yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view event made by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The event was held on March 29, 1987 at the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.
The event is notable for the reported gathering 93,173 people, the largest recorded attendance for a live indoor sporting event in North America and the largest paying crowd in the history of professional wrestling. Though the attendance number is subject to dispute, the event is considered to be the peak of the 1980s wrestling boom. Almost one million people watched the event at 160 locations that had special television of the event, in North America. The number of people watching on pay-per-view was guessed at several million, and pay-per-view revenues were estimated at $10 million.
