The Sui Dynasty (隋朝 Suí cháo; 581-618 AD) was an imperial dynasty of China. It followed the "Jin Period" and was followed by the Tang Dynasty. It ended nearly four centuries of division between rival regimes.
The Sui Dynasty was founded by Emperor Wen, or "Yang Jian". Its capital was Chang'an (present-day Xi'an). The dynasty is important because it reunited Southern and Northern China and the Grand Canal was build in that time.
