Deism is the name of the belief that while a higher being (like the Christian God) exists, people should rely on logic and reason and not traditions of their religion. People who follow Deism are called Deists.
Famous Deists from history include first and third Presidents of the United States, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, famed French conqueror Napoleon Bonaparte, the French writer and philosopher Voltaire, and actor Marlon Brando.
