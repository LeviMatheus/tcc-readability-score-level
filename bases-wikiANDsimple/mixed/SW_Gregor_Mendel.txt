Gregor Johann Mendel (July 20, 1822 â€“ January 6, 1884) was an Austrian biologist and priest. He is said to be the "father of genetics" because of his work using pea plants. He discovered dominant and recessive genes from the tests he performed on the plants in his green house. The things he learned are known today as Mendelian inheritance rules.
