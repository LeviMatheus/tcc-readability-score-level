The World Heavyweight Championship is the top wrestling honor for World Wrestling Entertainment's Raw brand. It was created on RAW to match SmackDown! WWE Championship in August 2002. Some of the past champions include Triple H, The Undertaker, Booker T, Batista, and Kurt Angle.
The World Heavyweight Championship was brought to Raw by then-General Manager Eric Bischoff after WWE Champion Brock Lesnar became exclusive to SmackDown. Bischoff awarded the championship to Triple H, but he had to defend it against his then-best friend, Ric Flair. Triple H was successful and has held the championship on five different occasions. Other holders of this prestigious championship include Shawn Michaels, Undertaker, Rey Mysterio and more.
