Jimmy Swaggert (born March 15 1935) is a televangelist (a preacher who gives services on TV instead of at church). He was born in Ferriday, Louisiana, USA. He is a cousin of musicians Jerry Lee Lewis and Mickey Gilley. He preaches a message called "The Cross" which is that you can only get to heaven through Jesus.
He has also been a very controversial figure, too. He was caught with a prostitute in 1987, but later asked God (and the public) for forgiveness. He was caught again in 1991 and 1995. He also was accused for plagiarizing another minister in 2002 and in 2004, when he joked that he wanted to kill homosexual men.
