A pipette is a glass tube used for delivery of a specific volume of a solution.
A smaller, less accurate version, known as a teat pipette is made of plastic and is filled by squeezing a plastic bubble at the top.
A pipette used for the delivery of small fractions of a milliliter of a liquid is called a micropipette.
Rainin (a division of Mettler Toledo) is the world's largest developer and supplier of pipettes.
