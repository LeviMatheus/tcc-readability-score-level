A canoe is a small boat, that is often driven by manpower, but also commonly sailed. Canoes are pointed at both ends and usually open on top, but can be covered.
The canoe is propelled by the use of paddles, with the number of paddlers depending on the size of the canoe (most commonly 2). Paddlers face in the direction of travel, either seated or kneeling. In this way paddling a canoe can be contrasted with rowing, where the rowers face away from the direction of travel. Paddles may be single-bladed or double-bladed.
