A Pentacle is a five pointed star, with all lines the same length and all angles the same.
A Pentagram is pentacle drawn in a circle so the points touch the circle.
The pentagram has has many meanings. To some people means peace, harmony and tranquility. As a religious symbol it is associated with Wicca, but other religions use too. To some people it means the five wounds of Jesus Christ (the nails in each hand and foot, and the spear wound in his side). In Taoism a pentagram shows how the religious elements (earth, water, wood, fire, and metal) are related. But pentacles and pentagrams have many meanings.
A Pentacle is on the flag of Morocco.
In old times the pentagram was a symbol for good and for protection against evil. In modern times people often mistakenly think that the pentagram itself symbolises evil. Some people also use an upside down pentagram to mean bad magic, evil and the Devil; some people think all pentagrams mean this. Satanists use this kind pentagram to mean their religion. Satanists call an upside down pentagram a "Baphomet". Some Wiccans call a pentagram a pentacle because of that, so people will not think they are evil. There are many times in literature where a pentagram is encountered. In Sir Gawain and The Green Knight, the pentagram is mentioned as a symbol for Gawain's good charachter and truth.
