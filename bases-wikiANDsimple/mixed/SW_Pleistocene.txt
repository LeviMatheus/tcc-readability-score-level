The Pleistocene epoch was a very long period of time. It stretched from 1,808,000 to 11,550 years ago. It was full of ice ages. Ice ages are when the world becomes much colder for a long time. Many animals that do not exist anymore lived then. Many of them were larger or hairier versions of animals that live now. Glyptodon was something like a giant armadillo, and mammoths were hairy elephants.
Cavemen and other ancient humans lived during the Pleistocene. They hunted many of the animals until there were not any left.
