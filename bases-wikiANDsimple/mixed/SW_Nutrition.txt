Nutrition provides the cells of an organism with food, in a form they can use. Organisms need food to be able to keep running properly. They also need food to be able to do certain things.
Different organisms have different food requirements, and they eat different things in order to meet those requirements. Animals that don't eat meat, for example, will have to get certain nutrients like protein from other foods.
