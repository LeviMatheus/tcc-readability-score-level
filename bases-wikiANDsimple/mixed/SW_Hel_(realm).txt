Hel is one of the nine worlds of Norse mythology. It is where the dead people are. Its ruler is the goddess Hel. Hel is located under the roots of the tree Yggdrasil. It can be reached via the river Gjöll. A bridge spans this river. The bridge is garded by the giantess Modgrudr. Garm, a dog, guards the entrance to the castle of Hel. He lets the dead souls enter. They cannot get out though. A rooster is the companion of Garm. When the rooster in the realm of the gods will wake them for Ragnarök, this rooster will wake the souls of the dead.
The dragon Nidhögg eats from the corpses of deceased criminals. A wolf also eats from these.
