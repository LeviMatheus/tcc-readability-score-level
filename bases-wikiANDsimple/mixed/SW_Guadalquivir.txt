Guadalquivir is a river to the south of Spain, which crosses the autonomous community of Andalusia. The name derives from the Arab "Wadi al-Kabir" ("big river"), whereas the Romans were called it a river "Betis".
Guadalquivir is born in the Glen of the Sources in the mountains near Cazorla (Jaen province) and ends in the population of Sanlucar de Barrameda (Cadiz province), passing through the provinces of Jaen, Cordoba, Seville and Cadiz. The length is 657 kilometres, and the principal tributaries are the rivers Genil (which flows through Granada), The Minor Guadiana, Guadalbullon, and Guadajoz on the left side, and Guadalmena, Jandula, and Guadiato on the right.
It is the only river in Spain with shipping traffic. At present, it only is navigable up to Seville, though in the Roman epoch it was navigable up to Cordoba.
