Mashiro Kazahana.
Mashiro first meets Mai Tokiha when Mai is trying to find Mikoto Minagi, and Mashiro is seen in a rose garden with a maid. When she later meets Mai, Mai finds out that Mashiro is the chairwoman of the Fuuka Academy. She is calm and seems to know more than the people of her age, even though she is just 14. She knows about the Himes, feeling sorry for them as if it was her own fault that the Himes were created.
Mashiro Blanc de Windbloom.
Mashiro Blanc de Winbloom is the queen of Windbloom, who is only 15. She is bossy and loud, parallel to Mashiro Kazahana. She gets angry easily, and when people say that she is a fake princess, she is shocked because she wants to be a queen so much. But a rumour says that the real princess was floated away in a casket, and that Mashiro was just a replacement for not finding the real princess. Mashiro doesn't look like the last rulers of Winbloom as well.
