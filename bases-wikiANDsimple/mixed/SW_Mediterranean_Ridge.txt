The Mediterranean Ridge is a wide ridge in the bed of the Mediterranean Sea. It is next to a rough quarter circle from Calabria, south of Crete, to the southwest corner of Turkey, and from there eastwards south of Turkey, with Cyprus. From what tectonic theory says, it is caused by the African Plate subducting under the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward, it plows up the sediment layers of the Mediterranean, lifting them from the seabed, and then above sea level, making the island of Cyprus.
In the far future it could grow into a long and high mountain range if the continued northward movement of Africa destroys the Mediterranean Sea.
