eBox Platform is an open source distribution and development framework, based on the Linux operating system, made to manage services in a computer network.
It offers a layer of abstraction and management, accessible through a simple web interface, and also a simplified development environment for new features or customization.
eBox is licensed under GPL and started as an open-source, collaborative project of two companies. It also takes part on Morfeo Project. On 16th November 2006 eBox was officially approved as a NEOTEC project, receiving public funds from the CDTI (a Spanish public organisation, under the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) to complete the development of version 1.0.
Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon Tribe 3 featured eBox as "network services control tool".
