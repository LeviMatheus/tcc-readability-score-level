Caen (pronounced "can" (/kɑ̃/); in other words, the "e" is not pronounced) is a city in France. It is the capital city of Basse-Normandie and Calvados. The river Orne flows through it. Today, about 110.000 people live there ("intra muros", inside the city); the urban area has about 370.000 people. The city has a very long history; the name probably has Gaulish origins (from "cato" Military activity; and "mago" field; probably something like "place where the troops exercised")..
