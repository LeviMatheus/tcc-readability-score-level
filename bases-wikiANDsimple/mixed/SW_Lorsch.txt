Lorsch is a small town in southwest Germany (south of Frankfurt am Main) in the Kreis Bergstra√üe district of the state of Hessen. More than 12,000 people live in the town.
It is the site of a Benedictine abbey, which used to be one of the greatest centers of Carolingian art. Several Carolingian kings of Germany were buried there. The abbey is also famous for the Lorsch Codex, which was produced there around the end of the 12th century. The abbey has been declared a World Heritage Site. The "Nibelungenlied" identifies Lorsch as the birth place of Siegfried.
