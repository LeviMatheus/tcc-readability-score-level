Abū Bakr (c. 573–August 23 634/13 AH) was the first Muslim ruler after the Prophet Muhammad (632–634). While Sunnis regard him as his rightful successor ("caliph"), chosen by the people. The Shi'a Islam insist that he violated Muhammad's direct orders and made a Coup d'état. International lists have him as the first Muslim Caliph.
