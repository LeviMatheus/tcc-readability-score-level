Saint-Fons is a French city next to Lyon. About 15.000 people live there. The name of the city does not come from a saint. It is because there are many fountains near the city. Originally the place name was "Cent Fonts" (100 sources), which was changed into the current city name. The city split from VÃ©nissieux in the middle of the 19th century. The main reason for splitting was because of the chemical industry in the spot.
