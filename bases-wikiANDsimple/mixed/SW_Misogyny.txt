Misogyny means hating women. A misogynist is a person who hates women. Misogynists hate women because they believe there is something wrong with them, such as being stupid, dirty or evil.
Misogyny is different from sexism, which is not based on hate. Sexist wants to give different rights and roles to women and men, but not because there is something wrong with either sex. Sexist thinks it is natural or right that sexes have different rights and roles. They believe God or nature has made women and men different and therefore they belong to different roles.
