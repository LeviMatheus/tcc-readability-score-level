Anaestesia (or Anesthesia) is when a doctor can block pain, or alter how people feel pain. This can also be true for other sensations. That way, people can have surgery without feeling most of that pain. These three tasks are known as the 'triad of anaesthesia'.
More precisely, anaesthesia (or anesthesia) is 'sleep' and analgesia is the relief of pain. Modern Anaesthesia is highly complex and often involves a combination of anaesthesia, analgesia and muscle relaxation to enable surgeons or proceduralists to do their part. These three tasks are known as the triad of anaesthesia.
If people are simply made to feel more pleasantly, or less anxious, this is called sedation.
