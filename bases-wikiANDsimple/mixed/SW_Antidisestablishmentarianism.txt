Antidisestablishmentarianism is one of the longest words in the English language. It is often used just because of its length, and not because of its meaning. Part of the reason for this is that antidisestablishmentarianism describes something that people no longer talk about very much.
An official state church is called the "established" church, so "dis"establishmentarianism is the act of "getting rid" of the established church. This means that anti"dis"establishmentarianism describes groups of people who are against "getting rid" of the established church. It is very often used to describe those who do not want the Church of England to stop being established.
