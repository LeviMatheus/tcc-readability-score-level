The Rhine Falls, called the Rheinfall in Switzerland, are the biggest waterfalls of Europe.
They can be found in the High Rhine in the upper parts of the river Rhine, in the municipalities of Neuhausen am Rheinfall and Laufen-Uhwiesen, near the town of Schaffhausen in the north part of Switzerland and close to the German border. They are 150 meters (450 ft) wide and 23 meters (75 ft) tall.
The Rhine Falls were made in the last ice age about 14,000 to 17,000 years ago.
