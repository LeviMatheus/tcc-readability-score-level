The 1760s (pronounced "seventeen-sixties") was a decade of the Gregorian calendar that began on January 1, 1760, and ended on December 31, 1769.
Marked by great upheavals on culture, technology, and diplomacy, the 1760s was a transitional decade that effectively brought on the modern era from Baroqueism. The Seven Years' War – arguably the most widespread conflict of its time – carried trends of imperialism outside of European reaches, where it would head on to pillage countless of territories (mainly in Asia and Africa) for decades to come with the wrath of colonialism. Due to skyrocketing ideals of republicanism at this period, dissatisfaction against monarchies would later spark revolutions such as the American and French Revolutions, in pursuit of democracy.
