The Eastern Catholic Churches are autonomous churches. They recognize the pope as their spiritual leader. They also agree with Roman Catholicism on most issues. They differ on ideas as how a mass should be organised, or which prayers are more important than others. A very well-known Eastern Catholic Church is the Coptic Catholic Church, located mainly in Egypt.
The word Eastern Catholic Churches refers to a number of Christian Churches. These churches recognise the pope as the leader of the Church, like the Roman Catholics do. They are independent of the Church of Rome otherwise. They also do certain things a little differently than the Church of Rome does.
