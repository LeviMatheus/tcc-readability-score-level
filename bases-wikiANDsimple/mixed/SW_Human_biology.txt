Human biology is an academic field that is part of biology, biological anthropology, and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.
There are not exact boundaries between human biology and regular medical research. However, human biology usually focuses more on health for an entire group of people, and on human evolution, adaptation, and population genetics rather than individual health.
