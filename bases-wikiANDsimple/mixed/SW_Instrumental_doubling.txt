The term "doubling" is often used in the woodwind section. An oboist may sometimes double on the cor anglais, a clarinettist may sometimes double on a bass clarinet, and a bassoonist may double on a contrabassoon. At other times such instruments may need a separate player. At the beginning of a musical score there should be a list of instruments that makes it clear how many players are needed.
