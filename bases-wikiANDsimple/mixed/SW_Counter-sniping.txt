Counter-sniping is a job performed by soldiers in an army to find and kill an enemy sniper. They use binoculars, telescopes, and sniper scopes to locate the enemy. Once he is found, usually they will have another sniper try to shoot him.
When famous people give speeches, the police sometimes use counter-snipers to prevent the person from being shot.
