Urartu (Assyrian "Urará¹­u", Urartian "Biainili") was an ancient kingdom of Armenia located in the mountainous plateau between Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and Caucasus mountains, later known as the Armenian Highland, and it centered around Lake Van (present-day eastern Turkey). The kingdom existed from ca. 860 BC, emerging from Late Bronze Age Nairi polities, until 585 BC. The name corresponds to the Biblical Ararat.
Some experts say that the Armenians are a mixture of different peoples in history: like The Hurrians, Urarteans, Luvians and Mushki. This last group, also knowns as Phrygians may have brought their Indo-European language to Armenia. The Armenian language today is Indo-European, but shows a lot of influence from the earlier languages, especially Urartean.
Urartu extended from Lake Van southeastward to Mannai, and sometimes even included that land as one of its provinces.
