An ornamental plant is a plant that is grown for how it looks and not for its commercial or other value. The term is often shortened to ornamental (usually as a noun) when used in the context of plants.
Ornamental plants are usually grown in the flower garden, or as house plants. Most commonly they are grown for display of their flowers. Other common ornamental features include leaves, scent, fruit, stem and bark. In all cases, their purpose is the enjoyment of gardeners and visitors. Ornamental plants may also be used for landscaping, and for cut flowers.
