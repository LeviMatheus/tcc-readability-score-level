"Amazing Grace" is a well-known Christian hymn. The words were written late in 1772 by Englishman John Newton.
John Newton and the lyrics to Amazing Grace.
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That sav’d a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
How precious did that grace appear,
Thro’ many dangers, toils and snares,
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.
The Lord has promis’d good to me,
He will my shield and portion be,
Yes, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
But God, who call’d me here below,
