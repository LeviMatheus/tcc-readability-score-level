Psychedelic mushrooms is the name given to certain kinds of mushrooms. They contain the alkaloid psilocybin and other related tryptamine derivatives. Psilocybin changes certain things in the brain. This leads to the nerve cells giving more signals - generally translated to a different consciousness. This can lead to effects like hallucinations or visions. They can also be used for medical purposes to treat cluster headaches, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and certain kinds of depression.
Physiologically, they do not harm the human body, and can be used to treat cluster headaches and other medical conditions. Some psychological problems are possible from use, but not likely or common.
Psilcybin is can kill. The LD50 of Psilocibin is 280 mg/kg for rats, this is about 1.5 times that of caffeine. In normal shrooms, psilocybin makes up about 1% of their weight. Therefore, nearly 1.7 kilograms of dried mushrooms, or 17 kilograms of fresh mushrooms, would be required for a 60kg person to reach the 280mg/kg LD50 rate of rats.
