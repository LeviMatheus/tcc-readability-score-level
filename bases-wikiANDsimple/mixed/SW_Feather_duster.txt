A feather duster is a tool used for cleaning. It consists typically of a handle and a segment composed of natural or artificial feathers which form the cleaning-contact surface. It is particularly useful for removing dust from surfaces.
Feather dusters use the principles of static electricity to take up small debris such as dander.
