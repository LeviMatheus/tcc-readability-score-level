The Wimbledon Championships is one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments. It is played in Wimbledon, a suburb of London in England, Great Britain. The Championships are unique because they are the only Grand Slam played on a grass court.
Wimbledon was first competed in 1877. It has always been played during the summer. It is played over two weeks, from late June to the beginning of July. The tournament is played after the French Open and before the U.S. Open.
The winners in 2008 were Rafael Nadal and Venus Williams.
Seedings.
In every tennis competition, players are given a seed to help decide their place in the draw. At Wimbledon, they use a player's performances (whether good or bad) on grass to help decide the seed. At other tennis competition, seedings are chosen based only on rankings.
Clothing.
The umpires (referees) and linesmen all have to wear special dark green and mauve clothing. The players have to wear all white.
Etiquette.
Female players always have their names announced with "Miss" or "Mrs"; this is unlike any other Grand Slam tournament. If Queen Elizabeth is in the audience, it is normal for players to bow to her.
Food.
People in the audience traditionally eat a dessert of strawberries & cream, and so it is synonymous with Wimbledon.
