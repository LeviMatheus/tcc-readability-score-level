The Great Dark Spot was a dark spot on Neptune similar in appearance to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. It was discovered in 1989 by NASA's "Voyager 2" probe. Although it appeared similar to Jupiter's spot, which was an anticyclonic storm, it is believed that the Great Dark Spot was an atmospheric hole similar to the hole in Earth's ozone layer.
