Guildford (; IPA) is the county town of Surrey, England. It is the county seat for the borough of Guildford and the administrative headquarters of the South East England region. It is located about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of London on the A3 trunk road. About 66.000 people live there.
The town has Saxon roots.
Its location is due to the gap in the North Downs where the River Wey is forded by the Harrow Way. The town became important enough by 978 to be the Royal Mint. With the building of the Wey Navigation and Basingstoke Canal Guildford was in the centre of a network of waterways that aided its prosperity.
The Guildford pub bombing in 1974 killed five people including four off-duty soldiers from the local barracks. The subsequently arrested suspects became known as the Guildford Four.
