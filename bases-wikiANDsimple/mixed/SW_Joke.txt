A joke is something told to make people laugh. There are many kinds of jokes, but in English most of them are made of questions with surprising answers or stories with unexpected endings. The humour of a joke comes from the surprise.
There are jokes about anything. Jokes can be found anywhere - on the Internet, in books or heard from friends. Some jokes are about certain types of people and can hurt people's feelings, for example if they are racist or sexist.
Jokes are used in comedy, plays and movies.
