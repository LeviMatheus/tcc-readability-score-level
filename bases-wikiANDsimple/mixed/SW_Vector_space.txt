A vector space is a concept from mathematics. A vector space is a collection of objects called vectors. Two operations are defined: addition of two vectors and multiplication of a vector with a scalar (multiplication results in scaling).
A vector can be represented graphically with an arrow that has a tail and a head. Addition means the tail of one vector is placed at the same point as the head of the other vector. The sum vector is the one whose tail is the tail of the first vector and whose head is the head of the second. Multiplication means that one vector is made bigger or smaller.
There are some combinations of vectors that are special. A mininum set of vectors that, through some combination of addition and multiplication, can reach any point in the vector space is called a basis of that vector space.
