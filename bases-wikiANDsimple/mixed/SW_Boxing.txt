Boxing is considered to be the world's oldest combat sport. It is usually held in a ring and two boxers (people who participate in the sport) wear special gloves and try to hit one another.
There are few different outcomes to win in boxing. One is by a way of a knock out. Another way is by technical knockout, which is when the fighter can not continue fighting or the referee stops the fight. Another possibility is winning on points, which a boxer gets by outboxing his or her opponent by hitting the opponent more often, harder, and with better precision. There are also draws in boxing. A referee can announce a technical draw due to an accidental cut or an accidental wound like a headbutt. Generally, it is considered a "no contest" (NC). However, from the second round, or four in some places, if the score cards for both fighters are equal, the fight could be called a draw. Boxing is popular worldwide.
