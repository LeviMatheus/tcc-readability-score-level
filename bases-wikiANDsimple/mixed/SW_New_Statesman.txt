The "New Statesman" is a British left-wing political magazine that is published weekly in London.
History.
The "New Statesman" was founded in 1913 with the support of George Bernard Shaw and other prominent members of the Fabian Society.
In 1930 the "Statesman" merged with the Liberal weekly the " Nation", and changed its name to the "New Statesman and Nation", which it remained until 1964. The chairman of the "Nations board was the economist John Maynard Keynes, who came to be an important influence on the paper.
During the 1930s, the "Statesman" moved to the left politically. It became strongly anti-fascist and was generally critical of the government policy of appeasement of Mussolini and Hitler.
