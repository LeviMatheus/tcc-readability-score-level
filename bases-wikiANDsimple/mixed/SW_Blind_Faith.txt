Blind Faith was a rock group, that only were together for about one year (1969). It was formed by Eric Clapton (who had been in the band Cream) and Steve Winwood (who was in the band Traffic). Also in the band were Ginger Baker (who was Cream's drummer) and Rick Grech (who was in the band "Family"). Clapton, Winwood, and many other people had high expectations for the new band, but many people did not like the new stuff they were doing, and wanted to hear music like Cream and Traffic made. Many people did not like the band and they broke up. Before they broke they released a self-titled album, which caused controversy, because it only had six songs and featured a naked teenage girl holding a toy airplane on the cover, an image which upset some people.
