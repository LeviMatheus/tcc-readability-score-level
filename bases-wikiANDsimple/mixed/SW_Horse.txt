Horses and humans.
Horses have been domesticated for at least 5000 years. They have been used by humans in many different ways, for transportation, work, and food.
They are used for riding, as transport, sport and fun. They are also used for carrying things or pulling wagons, or to help plow fields in agriculture. Horses have also been used for meat, milk, and glue. Today, horses are mostly used for entertainment and sports. They also are still used for work and transportation in some places. Riding a horse to a place is known as coming "straight from the horse."
The latin name for horse is Equus.
