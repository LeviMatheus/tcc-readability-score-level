A computer monitor is an electronic device that shows pictures. A monitor is usually used to see programs on a computer. The main difference between a monitor and a television is that a monitor does not have a television tuner to change channels. A monitor may be used to watch television if it is connected to a device that has a television tuner. Some high monitors do have a television, and some televisions are used with computers. A monitor has a better display resolution than a television to make it easier to see smaller letters and graphics on.
