Salman Rushdie, (Devanagari: अहमद सलमान रश्दी Nastaliq:; born 19 June 1947) known as "Mallun Rushdie" in Islamic world, is a novelist and essayist and author of "Midnight's Children" (1981), which won the Booker Prize. Many muslims regard him as an agent of anti-Islamic forces. Rushdie was born in India, but lives in England.
He wrote a book in the year 1988, called "The Satanic Verses". Many Muslims see the book as blasphemous against Islam. It included prophet Muhammad as a character and mentioned the Satanic verses in a way that can easily be understood as criticism of Muhammad. Many countries banned this book because they argued it tried to spread hatred about all Muslims in general and Prophet (P.B.U.H) in particular.
The leader of the country of Iran talked on the radio about Rushdie. He said that Rushdie did not believe in Islam and that Rushdie should be executed for spreading the wrong and false word about Prophet Muhammad through this book. This is called a fatwa. In the year 1989, the British government began protecting Rushdie. In 1990, Rushdie wrote an essay, in which he tried to prove that he was a muslim. But many sources still say he is an atheist.
He has been married four times. His last marriage was to actress and model Padma Lakshmi; they divorced in 2007.
