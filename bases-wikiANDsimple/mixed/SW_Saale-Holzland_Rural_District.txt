Saale-Holzland-Kreis is a "landkreis" (rural district, or county) in the east of Thuringia, Germany.
History.
The district was set up in 1994 by joining the old districts of Eisenberg, Jena and Stadtroda. When the district of Stadt rod) was first set up in 1922 it already covered nearly the area of the current district. In 1952 the East German government abolished the federal states ("BundeslÃ¤nder"), and also split the district into the three parts, which were put together again in 1994.
