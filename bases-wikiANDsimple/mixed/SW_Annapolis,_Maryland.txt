Annapolis is the capital city of the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the census held in the year 2000, its population was 35,838. It is home to the United States Naval Academy, where the United States Naval Officers get their training. It is also home to Saint John's College, originally King William's School founded in 1696. Annapolis is the oldest seat of government still in service in America.
Annapolis is also well known as the Sailing Capital of the U.S., situated on the Chesapeake Bay, the largest inland tidal estuary in the world (?). The Chesapeake is Maryland's canary in the coal mine, troubled for the last 50 years by ever increasing degredation as an indicaitor of its citizens concern for economic or material value over that of their land. The Chesapeake Bay can not sustain the higher life that once proliferated these waters, and 3 of the main harvests need to be re-stocked by man in order to maintain 1/10th (or less) of the numbers - Oysters and Rockfish, and more recently as reported in the Capital, Blue Crab stocks are at an all-time and ever-decreasing low, with scientists from University of Maryland researching how to raise crabs for re-introduction.
Chesapeake Bay Native plants and animals are often crowded out by invasives which are more hardy to the now-polluted environment. Species such as Fragmites, the Chinese Mitten Crab, English Ivy, the Mute Swan are just a few examples of invasives thriving in this man-altered environment.
It is also a political hot spot, being so close to Washington DC, and being the State capital, many Annapolitans (those that live here) have a small percentage(probably.04) more weight with the governments because of the locality.
