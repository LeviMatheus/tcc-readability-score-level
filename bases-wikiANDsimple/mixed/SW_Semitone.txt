(British English) (also called a half step or a half tone) is the smallest musical interval used in Western music.. It is the distance between two notes which are next to one another in pitch.
A whole tone means a distance of two semitones, i.e. the distance between two notes which are separated by one other note in pitch.
This is easy to see with a picture of a keyboard. The distance between two white notes that are side by side may be a whole tone (if there is a black note in between them) or a semitone (if there is no black note between).
To go from a C to a C sharp (or D flat) is a semitone.
