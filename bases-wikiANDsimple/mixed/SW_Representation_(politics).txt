In politics, representation describes how political power is given from a large group for a certain time period in the hands of a comparatively small group of its members. Representation usually refers to representative democracies, where elected officials (so-called "representatives") nominally speak for their electors in the legislature. Generally, only citizens have representation in the government in the form of voting rights.
