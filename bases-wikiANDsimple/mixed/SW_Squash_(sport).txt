Squash is a sport in which two players hit a ball with a racket (or "Racquet"). The aim of the game is to beat the opponent by making the ball bounce twice before they can hit their turn, or for them to hit the ball out of play.
The ball is made of rubber. It is warmed before the game is started, so it bounces more.
The racket(or "Racquet") is similar to tennis racket, but it's lighter than tennis racket.
