Change is the money returned after paying for something with more money than it costs. For example, if someone buys a 25-pence sweet bar with 1 pound (100 pence), they will get 75 pence back.
Change can also mean any kind of money in coin form. To have "exact change" means to have the exact cost of the item. In the United States, buses require people riding the bus to have "exact change". The bus does not give money back. They must pay exactly what the cost is, they can't pay more.
