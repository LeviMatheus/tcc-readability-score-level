Bedouin people live in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East. They call themselves "people of the tent".
This is because they are "nomadic", which means they do not live in houses but travel around, living in tents. Bedouin were always camel raisers and drivers, sheep and goat nomads, cattle driving nomads, merchants. Today many Bedouin have given up the nomadic life and live and work in towns. But most do not forget that they are bedouin, and are proud of their heritage.
For example, the actor Nadim Sawalha is proud of not knowing his exact date of birth because he was born when his family were nomadic bedouin. He is equally proud of the pioneering work his family did in the hotel and tourism industry when they settled in town in Jordan.
