Nuclear missiles are missiles (rockets who land on the earth or hit something in the air, the water, or whatever) with atomic bombs inside.
In the time of Cold War the USA and the Soviet Union were enemies and thought the other side was going to attack them. To dissuade the other side from attacking, both sides built lots of nuclear missiles to make sure that in case they were attacked they would be able to do more damage than the other side. After the war, people realized too many missiles meant neither side was safe, so since then both sides have gotten many less missiles.
