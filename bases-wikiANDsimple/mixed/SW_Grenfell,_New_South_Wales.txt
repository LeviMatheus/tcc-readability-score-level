Grenfell is a country town in the Central West of New South Wales, Australia. It is in the Weddin Shire. It is 370 km west of Sydney. It is close to Forbes, Cowra and Young. In 2006 there were 1,994 people living in Grenfell.
The Grenfell area was the home of the Wiradjuri Aborigines. Europeans first settled when gold was found at Emu Creek. The town was renamed after John Grenfell, the Gold Commissioner at Forbes. He had been killed in 1866 when bushrangers attacked a stagecoach on which he was travelling.
By 1870-71 more gold was found than in any other town in NSW. By the middle of the 1870s the gold was running out. Wheat was first grown in the area in 1871. The railway reached Grenfell in 1901.
The poet and story writer Henry Lawson was born on the gold fields. On the Queen's Birthday weekend in June every year, the town has The Henry Lawson Festival of Arts. Thousands of people come from all over Australia for the art, poetry and writing competitions. Over the years, famous visitors have included Chips Rafferty, Barry Humphries, Patrick White and Sigrid Thornton.
In June 2007, the Spirit of the Bush Concert was held. It was organized by Australian of the Year, Lee Kernaghan, local and international star Steve Forde & the Flange, Adam Brand, Leo Sayer, Diesel, and The McClymonts.
Cricketer Stan McCabe, cyclist Reggie "IronMan" McNamara and tennis player Jan Lehane were also born in Grenfell.
The Grenfell area has been badly affected by drought since 2001.
