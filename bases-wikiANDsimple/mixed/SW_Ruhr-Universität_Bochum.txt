The Ruhr-Universität Bochum is one of the biggest universities in Germany. It is located in the Ruhr-Area, in the city of Bochum.
History.
The Ruhr-Universtität was the first public university that was founded in West Germany after World War II (in 1962). Later in the 1960s education expanded in West Germany and more universities were founded, but Bochum has a bright selection of subjects because it was the beginning of education expanding.
The Ruhr-University was one of the fourth largest university in Germany in the late 1980s and early 1990's with more than 40,000 students. But after the state of North Rhine-Westfalia decided to earn study fees, many students left the university and school examiners do not start studying anymore. Actually the fees are 1,000 Euro in the year (about 1,100 US$), but the Ruhr-Area is traditionally a working class region.
The university of Bochum was one of the first to have Bachelor and Master degrees instead of the traditional German Diplom and Magister degree.
Present situation.
The Ruhr-University has about 28,000 students. Academically it is an upper middle-class university with a lot of international affairs, especially with Eastern Europe and Asia. The Ruhr-University Bochum lost some subjects by when the state reduced its budget.
The main focuses in research are neurosciences, engineering, European law, plasma physics, solidstate physics, biochemistry, economics, Middle Ages and modern history, philosophy and languages.
