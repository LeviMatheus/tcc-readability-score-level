Paracelsus (11 November or 17 December 1493 in Einsiedeln, Switzerland â€“ 24 September 1541 in Salzburg, Austria) was an alchemist, physician, astrologer, and general occultist. He was born Phillip von Hohenheim, and later took up the name Philippus Theophrastus Aureolus Bombastus von Hohenheim, and still later took the title Paracelsus, meaning "equal to or greater than celsus".
He is credited for giving zinc its name (at the time he called it "zincum").
