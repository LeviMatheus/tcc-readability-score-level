A chemist is a scientist who studies chemistry. In England can also mean a pharmacist (person who dispenses medicines that doctors prescribe for people). Chemistry is the study of elements, atoms, molecules, and how they react together. Chemists research and test medicines, explosives, and just about everything else. Chemistry is a very important science because it is how we got almost all of the newer medicines.
