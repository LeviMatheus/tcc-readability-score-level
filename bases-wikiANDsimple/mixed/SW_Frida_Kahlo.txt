Magdalena Carmen Frida Kahlo y Calderón (July 6, 1907 – July 13, 1954) usually known as Frida Kahlo was a Mexican painter. She was known for her surreal and very personal works. She was married to Diego Rivera, also a well-known painter.
She was born at Coyoacán, Mexico. Because of a traffic accident at age 18 that left her crippled for life, Kahlo no longer continued her medical career but took up painting. She used ideas about things that had happened to her. Her paintings are often shocking in the way they show pain and the harsh lives of women. Fifty-five of her 143 paintings are of herself. She was also influenced by native Mexican culture, shown in bright colors, with a mixture of realism and symbolism. Her paintings attracted the attention of the artist Diego Rivera, whom she later married.
Kahlo's work is sometimes called "surrealist", and although she organized art shows several times with European surrealists, she herself did not like that label. Her attention to female themes, and the honesty in her painting them, made her something of a feminist cult figure in the last decades of the 20th century. Some of her work is seen at the Frida Kahlo Museum, found in her birthplace and home in suburban Mexico City.
