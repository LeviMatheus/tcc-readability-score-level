154 Bertha is a very dark and very big farther Main belt asteroid.
It was found by brothers Paul Henry and Prosper Henry on November 4, 1875, but the credit for finding the asteroid was given to Prosper. It is probably named after Berthe Martin-Flammarion, sister of the astronomer Camille Flammarion.
