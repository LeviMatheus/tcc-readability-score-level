Wind power in the United States is a growing industry. In 2007, the United States was the fastest growing wind power market in the world for the third year in a row.
At the end of August 2008 the United States wind power installed nameplate capacity was 20,152 MW, which is enough to serve 5 million average households. $9 billion was invested in 5,329 megawatts of new U.S. wind power capacity in 2007, causing the total U.S. wind power capacity to increase by 46%. Wind power accounted for 35% of all new U.S. electric generating capacity in 2007. American wind farms will generate an estimated 48 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of wind energy in 2008, just over 1.5% of U.S. electricity supply. In addition, new transmission facilities under development throughout the country should allow the future development of at least another 200,000 megawatts of wind power.
The growing U.S. wind market spurred new investment in turbine and component manufacturing plants, with enough new and planned facilities to create more than 4,700 new U.S. jobs.
Most new wind power capacity is being built in the central region of the United States. States with most wind capacity installed (to end of March 2008) are shown in the Table below.
