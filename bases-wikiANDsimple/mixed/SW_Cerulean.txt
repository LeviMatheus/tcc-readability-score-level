Cerulean is a range of colours from deep blue, sky-blue, bright blue or azure to greenish blue. The word cerulean comes from the Latin word "caeruleum", which means "sky" or "heavens". This was in turn from Latin "caeruleus" dark blue: resembling the blue of the sky.
In classical times, this term was used to describe blue pigments, particularly mixtures of copper and cobaltous oxides. These early attempts to create sky blue colours were often less than satisfactory due to greenish hues and lack of permanence. When the pigment cerulean blue was invented people started using this instead.
