Entomology is the science of insects. People who study insects are called entomologists. Insects have been studied since prehistoric times, but it was not until as early as the 16th century that insects were scientifically studied.
Some entomologists study how insects are related to each other. Others study how insects live and reproduce, because we do not know very much about some kinds of insects. Other entomologists study ways to keep insects away from crops that people use for food.There are billions of unknown species throughout the world and taxonimists catagorize the newly found.
Entomologists meet to talk about their study of insects and to share ideas, just as all scientists do.
