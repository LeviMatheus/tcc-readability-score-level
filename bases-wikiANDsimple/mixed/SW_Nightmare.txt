The term nightmare refers to very powerful dreams that the sleeper finds disturbing. They usually have either physiological causes, such as a high fever, or psychological ones, such as trauma or stress in the sleeper's life. Nightmares are common, but nightmares that happen very often can cause problems with sleep. They may cause people to get medical help.
Nightmares usually occur in REM sleep.
In earlier times.
In earlier times, people thought that such nightmares are really the work of demons. They though people were having nightmares because an Incubus was sitting on the chest of the sleeper. This can also be seen on the image. Sometimes people also thought magic and demonic possession were involved.
