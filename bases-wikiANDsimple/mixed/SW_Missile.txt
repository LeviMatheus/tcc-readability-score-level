A missile is a projectile that can be propelled by rocket fuel at a target.
Types of missiles.
The two main kinds of missiles are "rockets" and "guided missiles". A rocket is no longer controlled once it has been launched. A guided missile can be controlled after it has been launched.
Purpose.
Missiles are used in war to destroy military targets. Missiles can carry explosives or other destructive things. The objects a missile carries are called a "payload". This payload is not always harmful to people: in the Gulf War, missiles were used to launch reels of wire at electricity stations, causing the power to go out.
