A boson is a particle which has a whole number spin ('spin' is a quality assigned to sub-atomic particles). A photon is an example of a boson as it has a spin of 1. There are four known gauge bosons which are fundamental particles - they cannot be broken down into smaller particles. These gauge bosons carry forces. For example, the photon carries the electromagnetic force.
Bosons are named after a man called Satyendra Nath Bose.
