The arts is a part of culture and means much more than "art", which usually means the visual arts (things to look at such as painting, sculpture, fine art, decorative art, and crafts).
The arts means visual arts, performing arts (i.e. music, dance, drama), languages, and culinary arts as well.
Many artistic disciplines are a mixture of several arts.
"The arts" are usually contrasted with "The sciences".
