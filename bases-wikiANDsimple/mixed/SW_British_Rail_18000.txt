British Rail 18000 was a prototype mainline Gas turbine-electric locomotive built for British Railways in 1949 by Brown, Boveri & Cie. It had, however, been ordered by the Great Western Railway in 1940, but construction was delayed due to World War II. It spent its working life on the Western Region of British Railways, operating express passenger services from London Paddington station.
