History.
All of India was once ruled by the British Empire. The Indians wanted freedom, but the Hindus and the Muslims of India always argued. So it was decided to divide the country into two parts -- one part for Muslims and one part for Hindus. In 1947 Bengal, which was a province of India, was divided into West Bengal and East Bengal (which is now called Bangladesh). West Bengal went to India, and East Bengal went to Pakistan.
