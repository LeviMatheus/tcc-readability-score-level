The Chinese language is the language used by Chinese in China and elsewhere. It forms one of the groups of a language family called the Sino-Tibetan family of languages.
Chinese can refer to the written or the spoken languages. Chinese is special because although there are many spoken languages, they use only one way of writing the language. Therefore, it is possible to communicate by writing the same way. Many people in China think that although these different languages sound different, they are still one language. They call these different languages "dialects" to tell them apart from one another.
they refer to the Mandarin language. There are also other Chinese languages, like the Wu and Cantonese, with many speakers.
Chinese are used by the Han people in China and other races who have come to recognize themselves as Chinese. Chinese is almost always written in Chinese characters. They are symbols that have meaning, called logograms. Chinese characters have existed for over 5000 years. Nowadays the Mandarin language uses Hanyu pinyin to represent the sounds in Roman letters.
All the Chinese languages (or dialects) uses tones. This means that they use pitch sound to set one syllable apart from another. In this way, it is very different from English and most Western languages.
Traditional and Simplified characters.
In 1956, the government of the People's Republic of China made public a set of simplified Chinese characters to make learning, reading and writing the Chinese language easier. In Mainland China and Singapore, people use these simpler characters. In Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places where they speak Chinese, people still use the more traditional characters. The Korean language also uses Chinese characters to represent certain words. These are known in Korean as Hanja.
A Chinese person with a good education today knows 6,000-7,000 characters. About 3,000 Chinese characters are needed to read a Mainland newspaper.
Examples.
Here are some samples of some words and sentences in Mandarin Chinese. Simplified Characters are on the left, and Traditional characters are on the right. The pronunciation is given in the pinyin system, which may not always be as simple as it looks for those who have not studied it.
The Traditional Characters are now used in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Chinese from Mainland China uses the Simplified Characters, but may recognize Traditional Characters.
Before 1956, every Chinese uses the Traditional characters. But during then, 80% of the Chinese people cannot read and write. Many people feel that Traditional Characters are just too hard to remember and write. Because of the use of Simplified Characters, currently in China, more than 90% of the people have learned to read and write Chinese.
