Early life.
Delroy Lindo was born in 1952 in Lewisham, south east London, the son of Jamaican parents who had immigrated in the United Kingdom. Lindo grew up in nearby Eltham, and became interested in acting as a child when he appeared in a nativity play at school. Lindo's mother emigrated to the UK in 1951 from Jamaica to work as a nurse and his father worked in various jobs. As a teenager, he and his mother moved to Toronto, Ontario. When he was 16, they moved to San Francisco. At the age of 24, Lindo started acting studies at the American Conservatory Theater, graduating in 1979.
Career.
Lindo's film debut came in 1976 with the Canadian John Candy comedy "Find the Lady", followed by two other roles in films, including an army sergeant in "More American Graffiti" (1979).
He stopped his film career for 10 years to concentrate on theatre acting. In 1982 he debuted on Broadway in ""Master Harold"...and the Boys," directed by the play's South African author Athol Fugard. By 1988, Lindo had earned a Tony nomination for his portrayal of Herald Loomis in August Wilson's "Joe Turner's Come and Gone".
Lindo returned to film in the science fiction film "Salute of the Jugger" (1990), which has become a cult classic. Although he had turned down Spike Lee for a role in "Do the Right Thing", Lee cast him as Woody Carmichael in the drama "Crooklyn" (1994), which brought him notice. His other roles with Lee include the West Indian Archie, a psychotic gangster, in "Malcolm X" and a starring role as a neighborhood drug dealer in "Clockers".
Other films in which he has starring roles are Barry Sonnenfeld's "Get Shorty" (1995), Ron Howard's "Ransom" (1996) and "Soul of the Game" (1996), as the baseball player Satchel Paige.
In 1998 Lindo co-starred as African-American explorer Matthew Henson, in the TV film "Glory &amp; Honor", directed by Kevin Hooks. It portrayed his nearly 20-year partnership with Commander Robert Peary in Arctic exploration and their effort to find the Geographic North Pole in 1909. He received a Satellite Award for best actor. Lindo has continued to work in television and in 2006 was seen on the short-lived drama "Kidnapped".
Lindo had a small role in the 1995 film "Congo," playing the corrupt Captain Wanta. Lindo was not credited for the role. Lindo played an angel in the comedy film "A Life Less Ordinary" (1997).
He guest-starred on "The Simpsons" in the episode "Brawl in the Family", playing a character named Gabriel.
In the British film "Wondrous Oblivion" (2003), directed by Paul Morrison, he starred as Dennis Samuels, the father of a Jamaican immigrant family in London in the 1950s. Lindo said he made the film in honor of his parents, who had similarly moved to London in those years.
In 2007, Lindo began an association with Berkeley Repertory Theatre in Berkeley, California, when he directed Tanya Barfield's play "The Blue Door". In the autumn of 2008, Lindo revisited August Wilson's play "Joe Turner's Come and Gone", directing a production at the Berkeley Rep. In 2010, he played the role of elderly seer Bynum in David Lan's production of "Joe Turner" at the Young Vic Theatre in London.
In 2015, Lindo was expected to play Marcus Garvey in a biopic of the black nationalist historical figure that had been in pre-production for several years.
In 2020, Lindo starred in "Da 5 Bloods", another collaboration with Spike Lee.
Lindo has an honorary doctorate in Arts and Humanities from Virginia Union University and in 2014, earned a master's in fine arts from New York University’s Gallatin School.
