Sun Tzu (544 BC – 496 BC) (孫子 pinyin: Sūn Zǐ) was a Chinese writer. He wrote "The Art of War", a very famous book on military strategy (how to fight wars). He is also one of the earliest realists in international relations theory.
The name "Sun Tzu" is a title of honour given to Sun Wu (孫武, Sūn Wǔ), the author's name. The word "Wu", meaning "martial" or "military", is same as the word in "wu shu" or "martial art". Sun Wu also has a courtesy name, Chang Qing (長卿, Cháng Qīng)
