A sniper is a soldier in an army who has special training with sniper rifles. Snipers are able to shoot at targets very far away, or that are very small, and hit them accurately using a sniper scope. They are also specially trained to be stealthy and hard for the enemy to see when they are hiding, by using camouflage.
Many police departments have snipers on their SWAT team. Often hunters can learn many of the skills that snipers need to know, because the two jobs are very similar, and sniping developed from hunting "snipe", birds that were very hard to see and shoot.
Snipers in War.
Because snipers are very good at remaining hidden from the enemy, even enemies walking right on top of them, they are often used as scouts for the army. They use the scopes on their sniper rifles to see further than most soldiers are able to see. Because they are very well trained and usually very smart, snipers are often able to see details and remember information that ordinary soldiers would not.
Snipers usually work in teams of two, with a spotter. The spotter finds targets for the sniper, and if the sniper misses, the spotter helps him adjust his next shot so it hits.
