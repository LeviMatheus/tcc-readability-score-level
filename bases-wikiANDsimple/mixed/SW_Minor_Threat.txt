Minor Threat was hardcore punk band from Washington DC from the 1980s. Many other bands which played hardcore punk music in the United States were influenced by Minor Threat's music. Minor Threat's songs were usually short and fast. All of Minor Threat's records were released on the band's own Dischord Records label.
Minor Threat told their listeners they did not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol, which was called being "straight edge."
History.
Ian MacKaye, Jeff Nelson, bassist Brian Baker, and guitarist Lyle Preslar formed Minor Threat in 1980. Their first records were "Minor Threat" and "In My Eyes" in 1981. The group toured through the United States.
Their song "Straight Edge" had lyrics (words) that told people they did not use illegal drugs or drink alcohol, which was called being "straight edge." Another song called "Out of Step" tells listeners not to smoke tobacco. People often thought that the band was telling others not to do these things but in interviews the band states that straight edge is a personal decision.
Minor Threat broke up in 1983.
