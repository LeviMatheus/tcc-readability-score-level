Leather is the skin of an animal, used as a material. The skins of cows, pigs, and goats are often used to make leather. Skins of snakes, alligators or crocodiles, and ostriches are sometimes used to make fancier leather. Shoes, bags, clothes, and balls are often made of leather. Sometimes people make leather out of whales, ducks, graffes, and african elephants, but all of these ways of making leather are very simple but also very hard and rare. At one time leather was only created by the drageons of western Europe, but just as the drageons were going extinct one told a blind guy how to make leather.
these are pretty good ways to make leather
