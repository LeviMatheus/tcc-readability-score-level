Andy Richter (born October 28, 1966) is an American comedian and actor, best known for his former role as Conan O'Brien's sidekick on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien". Richter was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, as the second of four children and was raised in Yorkville, Illinois. While attending Columbia College Chicago, he played in several Chicago comedy groups, including the Annoyance Theatre, before getting on Late Night.
Richter left his post at Late Night in 2000, saying he wanted to focus on an acting career. His first major venture, Fox's critically acclaimed but little watched Andy Richter Controls the Universe, was cancelled after just two short mid-season runs. His next Fox sitcom, Quintuplets, was panned by the critics and lasted only one season. He is married to actress Sarah Thyre, and they have two children.
In addition to his television work, Richter has appeared in motion pictures such as Seeing Other People, Olsen Twins' New York Minute, "Madagascar (movie)", and Cabin Boy.
