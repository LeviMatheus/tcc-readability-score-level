The Angles were a Germanic people of unknown origin. Their name seems to be connected with Angeln, a modern district located in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.
The Angles, together with the Jutes, Saxons and Frisians, were mentioned amongst the Germanic tribes who sailed across the North Sea to raid and eventually invade Great Britain.
