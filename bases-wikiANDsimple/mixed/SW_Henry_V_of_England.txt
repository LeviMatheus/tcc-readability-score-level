Henry V of England (September 16, 1387 - 31 August 31, 1422) was the King of England from 1413 to 1422. He was born at Monmouth, Wales. It is not known whether he was born on 9 August 1386 or 16 September 1387.
Henry V was the son of Henry Bolingbroke, later Henry IV, and Mary de Bohun, who died before Bolingbroke became king.
During his reign, Henry increased his power as King of England and also took the title of King of France, over which English kings had been fighting for decades. He defeated the French at the famous Battle of Agincourt in 1415.
