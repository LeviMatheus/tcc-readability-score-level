The Gallo-Romance branch of Romance languages includes French and several other languages spoken in modern France and northern Italy and Spain. According to certain linguists, it also includes Occitan and Catalan; others group these two together as a separate Occitano-Romance branch, or place Catalan within the Ibero-Romance group. The Gallo-Romance languages, along with the Ibero-Romance and Rhaeto-Romance groups, form Western Romance.
