Peridot (pronounced "pair-uh-dot" or "pair-uh-doe") is the gem quality version of the mineral olivine. The name of the gemstone is believed to come from either the Arabic word "faridat" meaning "gem" or the French word "peritot" meaning "unclear." Peridot is one of the few gemstones that comes in only one color. The darkness of the green depends on how much iron there is. The color varies from yellow-green to olive to brownish green. Peridot is also often referred to as "poor man's emerald". Olivine is a very common mineral, but gem-quality peridot is rather rare. Peridot is the birthstone for the month of August.
