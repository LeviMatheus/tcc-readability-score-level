The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's biggest and highest-energy particle accelerator, used to make some subatomic particles called hadrons moving in opposite ways at up to 99.9999991% of the speed of light hit each other. It is at CERN which is close to Geneva, Switzerland. It has been hoped that, among other things, it will prove the existence of the Higgs boson, the only particle thought to exist by the Standard Model that has not been seen yet. It was first used on October 10, 2008, although problems with its magnets and liquid helium and the winter shutdown mean that it will not be used again until the spring of 2009.
