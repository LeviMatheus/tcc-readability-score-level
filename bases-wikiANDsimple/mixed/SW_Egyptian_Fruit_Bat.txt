The Egyptian Fruit Bat or Egyptian Rousette ("Rousettus aegyptiacus") is a species of Old World fruit bat.
It is found throughout Africa, except in the desert regions of the Sahara, and throughout the Middle East, as far east as Pakistan and northern Republic of India. Due to their extensive geographic range, and relatively large wild population, Rousettus aegyptiacus does not hold any specific conservation status.
