Copper is a chemical element. It is a reddish-coloured metal. Copper may well be the oldest metal in use, as very ancient copper tools have been found. Besides being part of ores, copper can be found in the metal form in some locations. Copper is used widely in many places.
When people mix Copper with tin, bronze is made. Bronze is an important metal, because it can be shaped into useful things, but it was more important before the use of iron was spread.
Copper is important in the human body. If someone does not get enough copper, the molecules in the body might not work. Having too much copper, though, can be a problem. Humans get most of the copper they need from food, and vitamins also contain copper to make sure we get enough.
Copper conducts electricity, so it is used to make different wires. It also does not react or rust easily, so it can be used for pipes. When copper does react to form new compounds, it turns a green color. The Statue of Liberty is made out of copper, and had to be cleaned because it had some green on it.
