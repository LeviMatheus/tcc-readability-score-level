A nativity scene is a scene of the Nativity of Jesus, or sometimes it may also be a crib (or manger in the United Kingdom, and cr√®che in France, which means "crib" or "manger" in French). It means a showing of the birth or birthplace of Jesus, either sculpted or using cut-out objects in a real setting.
