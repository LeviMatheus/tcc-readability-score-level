Therizinosaurus (ther-ih-zin-oh-sawr-us) was a huge omnivorous theropod dinosaur from the end of the Cretaceous period. It may be a relative to Ornithomimus. They were segnosaurs. Their fossils were first found in the late 1940s in Asia. They were named in 1954 after more bones were found. It was a thought to be a carnivore and herbivore; it had very long claws - they were about 3 ft long.
