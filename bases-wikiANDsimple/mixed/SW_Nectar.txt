Nectar, in botany, is a liquid made by the flowers of plants. It is very sweet because it has a lot of sugar in it. Plants make nectar to attract pollinating animals. It is made in glands called nectaries. The Nectaries are usually at the bottom of the perianth. This means the animal trying to get the nectar have to touch the parts of the plant that are used for reproduction. By doing this, the animal getting the nectar helps the plants reproduce. Some plants make nectar outside the flower. These plants do it to attract predatory insects. These insects will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects found near the plant.
Nectar is economically important because it is where the sugar for honey comes from. It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adults of many predatory insects, as well as hummingbirds, eat nectar. Nectar from fruits can also be drank by people.
