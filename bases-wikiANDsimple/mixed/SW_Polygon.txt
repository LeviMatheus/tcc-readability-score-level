A polygon is a closed two-dimensional shape. It usually has three sides/corners or more. It has a number of edges. These edges are connected by lines. A square is a polygon because it has four sides. The smallest possible polygon in a Euclidean geometry or "flat geometry" is the triangle, but on a sphere, there can be a digon. The monogon is a theoretical figure that cannot exist - it has only one side and one edge.
If the edges (lines of the polygon) do not intersect (cross each other), the polygon is called "simple", otherwise it is "complex".
In computer graphics, polygons (especially triangles) are often used to make graphics.
