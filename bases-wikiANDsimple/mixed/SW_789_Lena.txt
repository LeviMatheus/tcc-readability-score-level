789 Lena is a medium-sized X-type asteroid orbiting in the Main belt near the Eunomia family. However, true family members are made up like an S-type, so it is almost certainly an unrelated asteroid. Lena has an unusual lightcurve, which means that
it is either a very slow rotator (with period well over 22 hours), very non-spherical, or both. It was found by Grigory Neujmin in 1914. Its provisional name was 1914 UU.
