WWE Heat is a professional wrestling show for World Wrestling Entertainment, the show uses superstars from the "Raw" Brand.
Heat's History.
The show started on August 1, 2008 when the show was called WWF Sunday Night Heat. It held this name until 2002 when the show was renamed as WWE HEAT, the show would later be renamed to its current name. Since the brand extension in 2002, "HEAT" has been broadcast with only "RAW" superstars and reverted back to being before "RAW". The exception to this was on pay-per-view nights, which were broadcast live from the pay-per-view venue and could involve "SmackDown!" wrestlers. In May 2002, "SmackDown!" branched off its own sister show, "Velocity", which replaced "JAKKED/METAL", and worked the same as Heat.
Steven Richards, who at one time was the most regular competitor on "Sunday Night HEAT", dubbed himself "General Manager of "HEAT" (though he carried out no GM duties) and began calling the show "Stevie Night HEAT".
