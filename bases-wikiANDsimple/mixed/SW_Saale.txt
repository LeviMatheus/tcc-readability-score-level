Saale is the name of two rivers in Germany: Saale in Thuringia and Saxony-Anhalt (German: "Sächsische Saale") and the Saale in Northern Bavaria (German: "Fränkische Saale"). The larger, and better known Sächsische Saale springs out of the Fichtelgebirge at 728 m and joins the Elbe in Saxony-Anhalt. It is 413 km long.
