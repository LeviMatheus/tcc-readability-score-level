The Anahim Volcanic Belt is a nearly east-west line of volcanoes stretches from the west coast of British Columbia, Canada, just north of Vancouver Island, and reaches into the Interior Plateau near Quesnel. The farther away from the coast, the younger the volcanoes tend to be. These volcanoes are thought to have formed because of the North American continent sliding westward over the Anahim hotspot. Volcanoes in this belt include the Rainbow, Ilgachuz, and Itcha Ranges, and the Nazko Cone, which last erupted about 7200 years ago.
