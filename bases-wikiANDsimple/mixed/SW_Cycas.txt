Cycas is a genus of plants. It is the only genus currently known in the cycad family. About 95 species are currently known. The probably best-known of these is cultivated and marketed as "Sago Palm" or "King Sago Palm". The plant is not a true palm, however. The generic name comes from Greek "kykas" and means "palm tree".
The genus is native to the Old World, with the species concentrated around the equatorial regions. It is native to eastern and southeastern Asia including the Philippines with 6 species (4 of which are endemic), eastern Africa (including Madagascar), northern Australia, Polynesia, and Micronesia. Australia has 26 species, while the Indo-Chinese area has about 30. The northernmost species ("C. revoluta") is found at 31°N in southern Japan. The southernmost ("C. megacarpa") is found at 26°S in southeast Queensland, Australia.
The plants have often been considered to be a living fossil. The earliest fossils of the genus "Cycas" appear in the Cenozoic although "Cycas"-like fossils that may belong to Cycadaceae extend well into the Mesozoic. "Cycas" is not closely related to other genera of cycads, and phylogenetic studies have shown that Cycadaceae is the sister-group to all other extant cycads.
