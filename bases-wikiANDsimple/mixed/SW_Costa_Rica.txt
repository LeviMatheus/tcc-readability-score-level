The Republic of Costa Rica is a country in Central America which has enjoyed a long period of peace since its 1948 civil war. Because of its political stability, it is nicknamed the "Switzerland of Latin America".
Over four million people live in Costa Rica; the capital is San José. Its currency is the colón. The president is Óscar Arias, he was elected in 2006, his work as president finish at 2010.
Perhaps the best part of Costa Rica is its weather. The average temperature is 25 C in the capital, and 28 C in the coastal areas. This weather is dubbed "eternal spring". There are only two seasons during the year: the dry season which spans from December to April, and the rainy or "Green Season" which starts in May and ends in November.
Costa Rica's official language is Spanish. Costa Rica has no army and uses the money previously used for defense on education.
