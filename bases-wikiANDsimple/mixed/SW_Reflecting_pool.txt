A reflecting pool or reflection pool is a pool of water that is in many memorials. It is usually shallow and calm, so that a visitor can see a reflection of the memorial in the water. Visitors are also supposed to think about what the memorial means while looking at the pool. This is also called reflecting.
The most famous reflecting pool is the one leading up to the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. Other famous reflecting pools are the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and the pool in front of the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.
