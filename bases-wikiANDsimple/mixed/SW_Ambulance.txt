An ambulance is a type of vehicle made to carry sick or injured people. Normally, ambulances go to people in emergencies to take people to hospital. Examples of emergencies include serious broken bones, chest pain, serious head injuries, and people injured in situations like car crashes.
Ambulances normally have emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and paramedics who work on them. The are highly trained to provide emergency care and treatment before reaching hospital.
They carry a lot of special equipment that can keep people alive, by giving them oxygen, restarting their heart if it stops, or repairing a collapsed lung.
Ambulances are normally called by dialing a specific emergency number, which is different from country to country. In the UK, this number is 999; USA 911; Europe 112.
Air Ambulance.
Air ambulances have also played an important role over the last 2 decades, with quick, or out-of-town medical support becoming a necessity. Both helicopters and jets are generally outfitted with the same kind equipment that you see in a typical ground ambulance. In the United States, the Coast Guard runs a public air ambulance service using helicopters. There are also privately owned air ambulance services that provide for a wider range of needs, including international transport.
