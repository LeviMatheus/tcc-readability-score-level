The Ford Crown Victoria is a large, rear wheel powered automobile. It has been widely used by both the general public as well as large businesses, government and law enforcement bodies. In 2008 Ford made the Crown Victoria "fleet-only", meaning they would no longer sell them one by one to the general public. They are most commonly seen as police cars and taxis.
