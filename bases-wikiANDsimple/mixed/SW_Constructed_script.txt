A constructed script (also artificial script, neography, and conscript for short) is a kind of writing system. It is a writing system that is specifically created by an individual or group, and is not like an evolved natural script. In contrast, natural scripts evolve and grow as part of a natural language or culture.
Some constructed scripts are made to be used for constructed languages. Other constructed scripts are used in linguistic experimentation or for other more practical uses in existing languages.
