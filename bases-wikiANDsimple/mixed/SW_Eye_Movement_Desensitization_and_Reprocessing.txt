Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a form of psychotherapy. It was developed to help relief stress and trauma from disturbing and unresolved life experiences. It is used to help with post-traumatic stress disorder.
EMDR involves movement of the eyes as a form of therapy. It has been being tested and researched since it was first developed in the 1980's. It has caused much controversy among scientists who do not believe that eye movement is an effective form of therapy and does not help.
