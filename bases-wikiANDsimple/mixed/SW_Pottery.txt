Pottery is the art of ceramics (objects made from fire-hardened clay). Traditionally, ceramics have been used to produce functional objects such as containers and later, for interior tiling.
Clay objects are fired in a special oven called a kiln at high temperatures. The Ceramicist may then apply a glaze to the surface before firing the object again. By using a glaze, the surface becomes both glossy, decorative and water-tight. However, some contemporary ceramicists have chosen to produce objects which fall more closely into the categories of 3D Design or Sculpture and do not necessarily have a function beyond the decorative or the conceptual arts.
Bare simple pottery objects without glazing are called "terra-cotta". That is Italian and means "burnt earth" or earthenware. The finest pottery objects, called "porcelain" are made from special clay called kaolin.
