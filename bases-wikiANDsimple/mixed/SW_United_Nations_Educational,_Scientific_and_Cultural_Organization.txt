The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is the United Nations agency that looks after
One of the things UNESCO does is to make a list of all the most important, special, interesting or beautiful places in the world. This list is called "UNESCO World Heritage Sites". These places and buildings musn't be destroyed, because they are importent and that beautiful that the people in the future can enjoy this places. These places are telling us a lot about the past. The Uluru for example tells us a lot about the culture of Aborigines. Most countries have at least one place on this list, but some have many. They include historical buildings or sites, beautiful landscapes, places that have scientific value (for instance in geology), or places that are very important to one culture (such as Uluru).
