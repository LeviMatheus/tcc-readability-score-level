New Brunswick () is one of the thirteen provinces and territories of Canada. It is one of the three Maritime provinces and one of the four Atlantic provinces. It is the only province with both French and English as its official languages.
New Brunswick is bordered by Quebec to the north, Nova Scotia to the east, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the northeast, the Bay of Fundy to the southeast, and the U.S. state of Maine to the west. New Brunswick is about 83% forested and its northern half is occupied by the Appalachians. The province's climate is continental with snowy winters and temperate summers.
New Brunswick has a surface area of 72,908 km2, and 747,101 inhabitants (2016). Atypically for Canada, only about half of the population lives in urban areas. New Brunswick's largest cities are Moncton and Saint John, while its capital is Fredericton. 
In 1969, New Brunswick passed the Official Languages Act which began recognizing French as an official language, along with English. New Brunswickers have the right to receive provincial government services in the official language of their choice. About 2/3 of the population are [[anglophone] and 1/3 are [[francophone]]. New Brunswick is home to most of the cultural region of [[Acadia]] and most [[Acadians]]. New Brunswick's [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of French is called [[Acadian French]] and 7 regional accents can be found.
New Brunswick was first inhabited by [[First Nations]] like the [[Miꞌkmaq]] and [[Maliseet]]. In 1604, [[Acadia]], the first [[New France]] [[French colonial empire|colony]], was founded with the creation of [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port-Royal]]. For 150 years afterwards, Acadia changed hands a few times due to numerous conflicts between [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. From 1755 to 1764, the [[British Empire|British]] deported [[Acadian]]s en masse, an event known as the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]]. This, along with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], solidified Acadia as [[British colonial empire|British property]]. In 1784, following the arrival of many [[loyalists]] fleeing the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], the colony of New Brunswick was officially created, separating it from what is now [[Nova Scotia]]. In the early 1800s, New Brunswick prospered and the population grew rapidly. In 1867, New Brunswick decided to [[Confederation of Canada|confederate]] with Nova Scotia and the [[Province of Canada]] (now [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]]) to form [[Canada]]. After [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], shipbuilding and lumbering declined, and [[protectionism]] disrupted trade with [[New England]]. 
From the mid-1900s onwards, New Brunswick was one of the poorest regions of Canada, a fact eventually mitigated by [[Canadian transfer payments|transfer payments]]. As of 2002, the provincial [[gross domestic product|GDP]] was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%. Most companies and news outlets in the province are owned by the [[Irving Group of Companies|Irving corporation]]. The province's 2019 output was CA$38.236 billion, which is 1.65% of Canada's [[List of Canadian provinces and territories by gross domestic product|GDP]]. 
Tourism accounts for 9% of the labour force either directly or indirectly. Popular destinations include the [[Hopewell Rocks]], [[Fundy National Park]], [[Magnetic Hill (Moncton)|Magnetic Hill]], [[Kouchibouguac National Park]] and [[Roosevelt Campobello International Park]].
History.
Early history.
[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous peoples]] have been in the area since about 7000 BC. At the time of European contact, inhabitants were the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], the [[Maliseet]], and the [[Passamaquoddy]]. Although these tribes did not leave a written record, their language is present in many placenames, such as [[Aroostook, New Brunswick|Aroostook]], [[Bouctouche]], [[Memramcook]], [[Petitcodiac, New Brunswick|Petitcodiac]], [[Quispamsis]], [[Richibucto]] and [[Shediac]].
New Brunswick may have been part of [[Vinland]] during the [[Norse exploration of North America]], and [[Basques|Basque]], [[Breton people|Breton]], and [[Normans|Norman]] fishermen may have visited the [[Bay of Fundy]] in the early 1500s.
European settlements.
French colony.
The first documented European visits were by [[Jacques Cartier]] in 1534. In 1604, a party including [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the mouth of the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]] on the eponymous [[Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]]. Now [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]], this was later the site of the first permanent European settlement in New Brunswick. French settlement eventually extended up the river to the site of present-day [[Fredericton]]. Other settlements in the southeast extended from [[Beaubassin]], near the present-day border with Nova Scotia, to [[Baie Verte, New Brunswick|Baie Verte]], and up the [[Petitcodiac, New Brunswick|Petitcodiac]], [[Memramcook, New Brunswick|Memramcook]], and [[Shepody, New Brunswick|Shepody]] Rivers.
[[File:FortBeausejour1750McCordMuseum.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Beauséjour]] at the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. The French built the fort in 1751 in an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia.]]
By the early 1700s the French settlements formed a part of [[Acadia]], a colonial division of [[New France]]. Acadia covered what is now the Maritimes, as well as bits of Quebec and Maine. The British conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula occurred during the [[Queen Anne's War]], and was formalized in the [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)|Treaty of Utrecht of 1713]]. After the war, French Acadia was reduced to Île Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) and [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île-Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]). The ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) remained disputed, with an informal border on the [[Isthmus of Chignecto]]. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built [[Fort Beauséjour]] at the isthmus in 1751.
From 1749 to 1755, the British [[Father Le Loutre's War|engaged in a campaign to consolidate]] its control over Nova Scotia. The resulting conflict led to an [[Acadian Exodus]] to French controlled territories in North America, including portions of continental Acadia. In 1755, the British [[Battle of Fort Beauséjour|captured Fort Beauséjour]], severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and Île-Royale. Unable to make most of the Acadians sign an unconditional oath of allegiance, British authorities undertook a campaign to [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expel the Acadians]] in the initial periods of the [[French and Indian War|Seven Years' War]].
British colony.
Continental Acadia was eventually incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia, with nearly all of [[New France]] being surrendered to the British with the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. Acadians that returned from exile discovered several thousand immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands. Some settled around Memramcook and along the Saint John River. In 1766, settlers from Pennsylvania founded Moncton, and English settlers from Yorkshire arrived in the Sackville area. However, settlement of the area remained slow in the mid-18th century.
[[File:Henry Sandham - The Coming of the Loyalists.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A romanticized depiction of the arrival of the [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalists]] in New Brunswick]]
After the American Revolution, about 10,000 [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] refugees settled along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy, commemorated in the province's motto, ("hope restored"). The number reached almost 14,000 by 1784, with about one in ten eventually returning to America. New Brunswick was founded in 1784 upon the partition of Nova Scotia into two areas which became the Provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. In the same year, New Brunswick formed its first elected assembly. The colony was named New Brunswick in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], [[King of Great Britain]], [[King of Ireland]], and [[prince-elector]] of [[Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg|Brunswick-Lüneburg]] in what is now Germany. In 1785, Saint John became Canada's first incorporated city. The population of the colony reached 26,000 in 1806 and 35,000 in 1812.
The 1800s saw an age of prosperity based on wood export and shipbuilding, which was bolstered by the [[Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty]] of 1854 and demand from the [[American Civil War]]. [[St. Martins, New Brunswick|St. Martins]] became the third most productive shipbuilding town in the Maritimes and produced over 500 vessels. In 1848, responsible home government was granted, and the 1850s saw the emergence of political parties largely organised along religious and ethnic lines. The first half of the 1800s saw large-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland, with the population reaching 252,047 by 1861.
The notion of unifying the separate colonies of [[British North America]] was discussed increasingly in the 1860s. Many felt the American Civil War to be the result of weak central government and wished to avoid such violence and chaos. The 1864 [[Charlottetown Conference]] was intended to discuss a [[Maritime Union]], but concerns over possible conquest by the Americans, coupled with a belief that Britain was unwilling to defend its colonies against an American attack, led to a request from the [[Province of Canada]] (now Ontario and Quebec) to expand the meeting's scope. In 1866 the United States cancelled the Reciprocity Treaty, leading to loss of trade with New England and prompting a desire to build trade within British North America, and [[Fenian raids]] increased support for union. On 1 July 1867, New Brunswick entered the [[Canadian Confederation]] along with Nova Scotia and the [[Province of Canada]].
Modern New Brunswick.
[[File:Alexander Henderson, Intercolonial Railway bridge at Sackville, NB, 1875.jpg|thumb|An [[Intercolonial Railway]] bridge, 1875. The railway was established as a result of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]].]]
Confederation brought into existence the [[Intercolonial Railway]] in 1872, a consolidation of the existing [[Nova Scotia Railway]], [[European and North American Railway]], and [[Grand Trunk Railway]]. In 1879 [[John A. Macdonald]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867–1942)|Conservatives]] enacted the [[National Policy]] which called for high tariffs and opposed [[free trade]], disrupting the trading relationship between the Maritimes and [[New England]]. The economic situation was worsened by the decline of the wooden ship building industry. The railways and tariffs did foster the growth of new industries in the province such as textile manufacturing, iron mills, and sugar refineries, many of which eventually failed to compete with better capitalized industry in central Canada.
In 1937 New Brunswick had the highest infant mortality and illiteracy rates in Canada. At the end of the [[Great Depression]] the New Brunswick standard of living was much below the Canadian average. In 1940 the [[Rowell–Sirois Commission]] reported that the federal government attempts to manage the depression illustrated grave flaws in the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare, education, and welfare, which were becoming increasingly expensive. The Commission recommended the creation of equalization payments, implemented in 1957.
After Canada joined [[World War II]], 14 NB army units were organized, in addition to [[The Royal New Brunswick Regiment]], and first deployed in the [[Italian campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]] in 1943. After the [[Normandy landings]] they redeployed to northwestern Europe, along with [[The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment|The North Shore Regiment]]. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]], a training program for ally pilots, established bases in Moncton, [[Chatham, New Brunswick|Chatham]], and [[Pennfield Ridge, New Brunswick|Pennfield Ridge]], as well as a military typing school in Saint John. While relatively unindustrialized before the war, New Brunswick became home to 34 plants on military contracts from which the province received over $78 million. [[William Lyon Mackenzie King|Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King]], who had promised no conscription, asked the provinces if they would release the government of said promise. New Brunswick voted 69.1% yes. The policy was not implemented until 1944, too late for many of the conscripts to be deployed. There were 1808 NB fatalities among the armed forces.
[[File:Bienvenue au Nouveau-Brunswick.jpg|thumb|A provincial welcome sign in English and French, the two official languages of the province]]
The Acadians in northern New Brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous English speakers to the south. The population of French origin grew dramatically after Confederation, from about 16 per cent in 1871 to 34 per cent in 1931. Government services were often not available in French, and the infrastructure in Francophone areas was less developed than elsewhere. In 1960 Premier [[Louis Robichaud]] embarked on the [[New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program]], in which education, rural road maintenance, and healthcare fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province, rather than the former county-based system. In 1969 the Robichaud government adopted the Official Languages Act making the province officially bilingual and establishing the right of New Brunswickers to obtain provincial government services in the official language of their choice. In 1982 at the request of the government of [[Richard Hatfield]], this right became part of the "[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]" and therefore part of the [[Constitution of Canada]].
The [[flag of New Brunswick]], based on the coat of arms, was adopted in 1965. The conventional heraldic representations of a lion and a ship represent colonial ties with Europe, and the importance of shipping at the time the coat of arms was assigned.
Geography.
[[File:New Brunswick topographic map-fr.svg|thumb|Topographic map of New Brunswick]]
Roughly square, New Brunswick is bordered on the north by Quebec, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Bay of Fundy, and on the west by the US state of Maine. The southeast corner of the province is connected to Nova Scotia at the isthmus of Chignecto.
Glaciation has left much of New Brunswick's uplands with only shallow, acidic soils which have discouraged settlement but which are home to enormous forests.
Climate.
New Brunswick's climate is more severe than that of the other Maritime provinces, which are lower and have more shoreline along the moderating sea. New Brunswick has a [[humid continental climate]], with slightly milder winters on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coastline. Elevated parts of the far north of the province have a [[subarctic climate]].
Evidence of [[Global warming|climate change]] in New Brunswick can be seen in its more intense precipitation events, more frequent winter [[Thaw (weather)|thaw]]s, and one quarter to half the amount of [[snowpack]]. Today the [[sea level]] is about 30 cm (1') higher than it was 100 years ago, and it is expected to rise twice that much again by the year 2100.
Flora and fauna.
[[File:Furbish lousewort (37037460636).jpg|thumb|[[Pedicularis furbishiae|Furbish's lousewort]] is a herb [[Endemism|endemic]] to the shores of the upper [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]].]]
Most of New Brunswick is forested with [[secondary forest]] or tertiary forest. At the start of European settlement, the Maritimes were covered from coast to coast by a forest of mature trees, giants by today's standards. Today less than one per cent of old-growth [[New England/Acadian forests|Acadian forest]] remains, and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] lists the Acadian Forest as endangered. Following the frequent large scale disturbances caused by settlement and timber harvesting, the Acadian forest is not growing back as it was, but is subject to borealization. This means that exposure-resistant species that are well adapted to the frequent large scale disturbances common in the boreal forest are increasingly abundant. These include [[jack pine]], [[Abies balsamea|balsam fir]], [[Picea mariana|black spruce]], [[Betula papyrifera|white birch]], and [[Populus|poplar]]. Forest ecosystems support large carnivores such as the [[bobcat]], [[Canada lynx]], and [[American black bear|black bear]], and the large herbivores [[moose]] and [[white-tailed deer]].
[[Fiddlehead fern|Fiddlehead greens]] are harvested from the [[Matteuccia|Ostrich fern]] which grows on riverbanks. [[Pedicularis furbishiae|Furbish's lousewort]], a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[Herbaceous plant|herb]] [[Endemism|endemic]] to the shores of the upper Saint John River, is an [[endangered species]] threatened by habitat destruction, riverside development, forestry, littering and recreational use of the riverbank. Many [[wetlands]] are being disrupted by the highly invasive [[Introduced species]] [[Lythrum salicaria|purple loosestrife]].
Geology.
[[File:Sandstone in Canada - IMG 0791 (11385934064).jpg|thumb|The [[Hopewell Rocks]] are rock formations located at the upper reaches of the [[Bay of Fundy]], near [[Hopewell Cape, New Brunswick|Hopewell Cape]].]]
Bedrock types range from 1 billion to 200 million years old.
Much of the bedrock in the west and north derives from ocean deposits in the [[Ordovician]] that were subject to [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Igneous rock|igneous]] [[Intrusive rock|intrusion]] and that were eventually covered with lava during the [[Paleozoic]], peaking during the [[Acadian orogeny]].
During the [[Carboniferous]] period, about 340 million years ago, New Brunswick was in the [[Maritimes Basin]], a [[sedimentary basin]] near the equator. Sediments, brought by rivers from surrounding highlands, accumulated there; after being compressed, they produced the Albert [[oil shale]]s of southern New Brunswick. Eventually, sea water from the [[Panthalassa|Panthalassic Ocean]] invaded the basin, forming the Windsor Sea. Once this receded, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]], [[sandstone]]s, and [[shale]]s accumulated. The [[rust]] colour of these was caused by the oxidation of iron in the beds between wet and dry periods. Such late Carboniferous rock formed the [[Hopewell Rocks]], which have been shaped by the extreme [[tidal range]] of the Bay of Fundy.
In the early [[Triassic]], as [[Pangea]] drifted north it was rent apart, forming the [[rift valley]] that is the Bay of Fundy. [[Magma]] pushed up through the cracks, forming [[basalt]] columns on [[Grand Manan]].
Topography.
[[File:027 NB BigNictauLake DSC 1468.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountains]] from [[Mount Carleton Provincial Park]]]]
New Brunswick lies entirely within the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian Mountain range]]. All of the [[List of rivers of New Brunswick|rivers of New Brunswick]] drain into the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] to the east or the [[Bay of Fundy]] to the south. These watersheds include lands in Quebec and Maine.
New Brunswick and the rest of the [[Maritime Peninsula]] was covered by thick layers of ice during the last glacial period (the [[Wisconsinian glaciation]]). It cut [[U-shaped valley]]s in the Saint John and [[Nepisiguit River]] valleys and pushed [[granite]] boulders from the Miramichi highlands south and east, leaving them as [[Glacial erratic|erratics]] when the ice receded at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation]], along with deposits such as the [[eskers]] between Woodstock and St George, which are today sources of sand and gravel.
Demographics.
[[File:Canada New Brunswick Density 2016.png|thumb|right|Population density of New Brunswick]]
Population.
The four [[Atlantic Provinces]] are Canada's least populated, with New Brunswick the [[Population of Canada by province and territory|third-least populous]] at 747,101 in 2016. The Atlantic provinces also have higher rural populations. New Brunswick was largely rural until 1951; since then, the rural-urban split has been roughly even. Population density in the Maritimes is above average among Canadian provinces, which reflects their small size and the fact that they do not possess large, unpopulated hinterlands, as do the other seven provinces and three territories.
New Brunswick's 107 municipalities cover of the province's land mass but are home to of its population. The three major [[urban area]]s are in the south of the province and are Greater Moncton, population 126,424, Greater Saint John, population 122,389, and Greater Fredericton, population 85,688.
Ethnicity and language.
[[File:New Brunswick CSD Languages, 2016.svg|thumb|The province's distribution of English and French is highly regional]]
In the 2001 census, the most commonly reported ethnicities were [[British people|British]] 40%, [[French Canadian]] and [[Acadians|Acadian]] 31%, [[Irish People|Irish]] 18%, other European 7%, [[First Nations]] 3%, [[Asian Canadian]] 2%. Each person could choose more than one ethnicity.
According to the Canadian Constitution, both English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick, making it the only officially bilingual province. Government and public services are available in both English and French.
For education, English-language and French-language systems serve the two linguistic communities at all levels.
Anglophone New Brunswickers make up roughly two-thirds of the population, while about one-third are Francophone. Recently there has been growth in the numbers of people reporting themselves as bilingual, with 34% reporting that they speak both English and French. This reflects a trend across Canada.
Religion.
In the 2011 census, 84% of provincial residents reported themselves as Christian: 52% were [[Roman Catholicism in Canada|Roman Catholic]], 8% [[Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches|Baptist]], 8% [[United Church of Canada]], 7% [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] and 9% other [[Christians|Christian]]. Fifteen percent of residents reported no religion.
Economy.
[[File:Cruise 003.JPG|thumb|Uptown Saint John is a commercial hub and seaport for the province.]]
As of October 2017, seasonally-adjusted employment is 73,400 for the goods-producing sector and 280,900 for the services-producing sector. Those in the goods-producing industries are mostly employed in manufacturing or construction, while those in services work in social assistance, trades, and health care. A large portion of the economy is controlled by the [[Irving Group of Companies]], which consists of the holdings of the family of [[K. C. Irving]]. The companies have significant holdings in [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[food processing]], [[freight transport]] (including [[railway]]s and trucking), media, [[Oil refinery|oil]], and [[shipbuilding]].
The United States is the province's largest export market, accounting for 92% of a foreign trade valued in 2014 at almost $13 billion, with refined petroleum making up 63% of that, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and non-metallic minerals (chiefly potash). The value of exports, mostly to the United States, was $1.6 billion in 2016. About half of that came from lobster. Other products include salmon, crab, and herring. In 2015, spending on non-resident [[tourism in New Brunswick]] was $441 million, which provided $87 million in tax revenue.
Primary sector.
A large number of residents from New Brunswick are employed in the [[primary sector of industry]]. More than 13,000 New Brunswickers work in agriculture, shipping products worth over $1 billion, half of which is from crops, and half of that from potatoes, mostly in the Saint John River valley. [[McCain Foods]] is one of the world's largest manufacturers of frozen potato products. Other products include apples, [[cranberries]], and [[maple syrup]]. New Brunswick was in 2015 the biggest producer of wild [[blueberries]] in Canada. The value of the livestock sector is about a quarter of a billion dollars, nearly half of which is dairy. Other sectors include poultry, fur, and goats, sheep, and pigs.
[[File:PulpAndPaperMill.jpg|thumb|A New Brunswick [[pulp mill]] owned by [[J. D. Irving]]]]
About 85-90% of New Brunswick is forested. Historically important, it accounted for more than 80% of exports in the mid-1800s. By the end of the 1800s the industry, and shipbuilding, were declining due to external economic factors. The 1920s saw the development of a pulp and paper industry. In the mid-1960s, forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests. The industry employs nearly 12,000, generating revenues around $437 million.
Mining was historically unimportant in the province, but has grown since the 1950s. The province's GDP from the Mining and Quarrying industry in 2015 was $299.5 million. [[List of mines in New Brunswick|Mines in New Brunswick]] produce lead, zinc, copper, and potash.
Education.
[[File:UNB Old Arts Building.jpg|thumb|[[Sir Howard Douglas Hall]] at the [[University of New Brunswick]] is the oldest university building still in use in Canada.]]
[[Public education]] [[primary education|elementary]] and [[secondary education]] in the province is administered by the provincial [[Department of Education and Early Childhood Development (New Brunswick)|Department of Education and Early Childhood Development]]. New Brunswick has a parallel system of Anglophone and Francophone [[state school|public schools]]. In the anglophone system, approximately 27 per cent of the students are enrolled in a [[French immersion]] programs.
The province also operates five public [[tertiary education|post-secondary institutions]], including four public universities and one [[college (Canada)|college]]. Four public universities operate campuses in New Brunswick, including the oldest English-language university in the country, the [[University of New Brunswick]]. Other English-language public universities include [[Mount Allison University]] and [[St. Thomas University (New Brunswick)|St. Thomas University]]. [[Université de Moncton]] is the province's only French-language university. All four universities offer [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]], and [[postgraduate education]]. Additionally, the Université de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick also provide [[Professional development|professional programs]].
Public colleges in the province are managed as a part of the [[New Brunswick Community College]] (NBCC) system, except for the [[New Brunswick College of Craft and Design|New Brunswick College of Craft &amp; Design]] , which has operated through the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour since 1938. In addition to public institutions, the province is also home to several private [[vocational schools]], such as the [[Moncton Flight College]]; and universities, the largest being [[Crandall University]].
Government.
[[File:New Brunswick Legislature.png|thumb|left|The [[New Brunswick Legislative Building]] serves as meeting place for the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|provincial legislative assembly]].]]
Under [[Canadian federalism]], power is divided between federal and provincial governments. Among areas under federal jurisdiction are citizenship, foreign affairs, national defence, fisheries, criminal law, indigenous policies, and many others. Provincial jurisdiction covers public lands, health, education, and local government, among other things. Jurisdiction is shared for immigration, pensions, agriculture, and welfare.
The parliamentary system of government is modelled on the British [[Westminster system]]. Forty-nine representatives, nearly always members of [[political party|political parties]], are elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]]. The [[head of government]] is the [[Premier of New Brunswick]], normally the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the legislative assembly. Governance is handled by the [[Executive Council (Commonwealth countries)|executive council]] ([[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]), with about 32 ministries. Ceremonial duties of the [[Monarchy in New Brunswick]] are mostly carried out by the [[Lieutenant Governor of New Brunswick]].
Under amendments to the province's Legislative Assembly Act in 2007, a provincial election is held every four years. The two largest political parties are the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association]] and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick]]. Since the [[2018 New Brunswick general election|2018 election]], minor parties are the [[Green Party of New Brunswick]] and the [[People's Alliance of New Brunswick]].
Judiciary.
The [[Appellate court|Court of Appeal]] of New Brunswick is the highest provincial court. It hears appeals from:
The system consists of eight Judicial Districts, loosely based on the counties. The [[Chief Justice of New Brunswick]] serves at the apex of this court structure.
Administrative divisions.
[[File:Administrative areas of New Brunswick with First Nations lands map-blank.svg|thumb|Administrative areas of New Brunswick (historic county borders also shown):
Historically [[List of counties of New Brunswick|the province was divided into counties]] with elected governance, but this was abolished in 1966. While county governments have been abolished in New Brunswick, counties continue to be used as [[census division]]s by [[Statistics Canada]], and as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. Counties continue to figure into the sense of identity of many New Brunwickers. Counties are further subdivided into [[List of parishes in New Brunswick|152 parishes]], which also lost their political significance in 1966 but are still used as [[census subdivision]]s by [[Statistics Canada]].
Ninety-two per cent of the land in the province, inhabited by about 35% of the population, is under provincial administration and has no local, elected representation. The 51% of the province that is [[Crown land]] is administered by the [[Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development (New Brunswick)|Department of Natural Resources and Energy Development]].
Most of the province is administrated as a [[Local service district (New Brunswick)|local service district (LSD)]], an unincorporated unit of local governance. As of 2017, there are 237 LSDs. Services, paid for by property taxes, include a variety of services such as fire protection, solid waste management, street lighting, and dog regulation. LSDs may elect advisory committees and work with the [[Department of Local Government (New Brunswick)|Department of Local Government]] to recommend how to spend locally collected taxes.
In 2006 there were three rural communities. This is a relatively new entity; to be created, it requires a population of 3,000 and a tax base of $200 million. In 2006 there were 101 municipalities.
[[Regional Service Commission]]s, which number 12, were introduced in 2013 to regulate regional planning and solid waste disposal, and provide a forum for discussion on a regional level of police and emergency services, climate change adaptation planning, and regional sport, recreational and cultural facilities. The commissions' administrative councils are populated by the mayors of each municipality or rural community within a region.
Provincial finances.
In 2015, New Brunswick had the most poorly-performing economy of any Canadian province, with a per capita income of $28,000. The government has historically run at a large deficit. With about half of the population being rural, it is expensive for the government to provide education and health services, which account for 60 per cent of government expenditure. Thirty-six per cent of the provincial budget is covered by federal cash transfers.
The government has frequently attempted to create employment through subsidies, which has often failed to generate long-term economic prosperity and has resulted in bad debt, examples of which include [[Bricklin SV-1|Bricklin]], Atcon, and the Marriott call centre in Fredericton.
According to a 2014 study by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, the large public debt is a very serious problem. Government revenues are shrinking because of a decline in federal transfer payments. Though expenditures are down (through government pension reform and a reduction in the number of public employees), they have increased relative to GDP, necessitating further measures to reduce debt in the future.
In the 2014–15 [[fiscal year]], provincial debt reached $12.2 billion or 37.7 per cent of nominal GDP, an increase over the $10.1 billion recorded in 2011–12. The [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] is projected to fall to 36.7% in 2019–20.
Infrastructure.
Energy.
Publicly owned [[NB Power]] operates 13 of [[List of power stations in New Brunswick|New Brunswick's generating stations]], deriving power from fuel oil and diesel (1497 MW), hydro (889 MW), nuclear (660 MW), and coal (467 MW). There were 30 active natural gas production sites in 2012.
Transportation.
The [[Department of Transportation and Infrastructure (New Brunswick)|Department of Transportation and Infrastructure]] maintains government facilities and the province's highway network and ferries.

Mount Allison University in Sackville began offering classes in 1854. The program came into its own under [[John A. Hammond]], from 1893 to 1916.

The three English-language dailies and the majority of the weeklies are owned and operated by [[Brunswick News]]—which is privately owned by [[James K. Irving]].
