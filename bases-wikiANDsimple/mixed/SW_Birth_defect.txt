Birth defect is the name people use to say that when a baby is born, there are some things, that are wrong with it. Birth defects are usually congenital; it means they are with the child from birth. However, only some of these defects are visible at birth. Some birth defects are with the child for many years before they get visible.
Some birth defects are more serious than others. Birthmarks are birth defects, as well. Some kinds are quite common. Most kinds pose little health risks.
How common birth defects are.
About 3 percent of all babies have what is called a "major physical anomaly". This is something that either impacts the way certain things look, or how they work.
Birth defects involving the brain are the most common problems. They concern about 10 per 1000 live births, compared to heart problems, at 8 per 1000, kidney problems at 4 per 1000, and limbs at 1 per 1000. All other physical anomalies together occur in 6 per 1000 live births.
Birth defects of the heart have the highest risk of death during childhood. They are the cause of 28% of infant deaths due to birth defects, while chromosomal abnormalities and respiratory abnormalities each account for 15%, and brain malformations about 12%. About 10% of deaths in children are because of a genetic disease. This is more than the number of deaths caused by infectious diseases.
China Birth Deformity Monitoring Centre says that one baby with birth defects is born every 30 seconds in China.
