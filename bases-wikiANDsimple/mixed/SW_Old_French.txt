Old French was the Romance dialect continuum spoken in the places of northern half of modern France and parts of modern Belgium and Switzerland from around 1000 to 1300. It was then known as the langue d'oïl (Oil languages) which makes it different from the langue d'oc (Occitan language, also then called Provençal), whose territory bordered that of Old French to the south.
The Old Frankish language had a large influence on the vocabulary of Old French after the conquest, by the tribe of the Franks, of the portions of Roman Gaul that are now France and Belgium during the Migration Period.
