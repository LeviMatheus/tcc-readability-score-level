John Warnock Hinckley, Jr. (born May 29, 1955) is the man who attempted to assassinate the United States President Ronald Reagan.
On March 30, 1981, shortly after Reagan was elected, Hinckley shot at Reagan in Washington, D.C. Reagan was injured, but recovered quickly. Hinckley was tried, but was found not guilty, due to his insanity. He said the reason he shot the President was to get the attention of actress Jodie Foster, who he was a fan of.
