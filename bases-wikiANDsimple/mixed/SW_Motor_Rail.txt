Motor Rail was a British locomotive-building company, based in Bedford. Formed in 1911 as The Motor Rail & Tramcar Co Ltd, they built petrol and diesel engined locomotives, mainly narrow gauge. During World War I over 900 locos were supplied for use on temporary military supply railways. The trade name Simplex was used from the early days; in 1972 the company was renamed Simplex Mechanical Handling Ltd.
