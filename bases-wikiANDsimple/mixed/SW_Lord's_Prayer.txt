The Lord's Prayer, is the best known prayer in the Christian religion. It is also known as the Our Father (because these are the first two words of the prayer) or Pater noster (which is Latin for "Our Father").
The Lord's Prayer is the prayer that Jesus taught the people to say when praying to God. It can be found in two places in the New Testament: one in the Gospel of Matthew (Chapter 6, verses 9-13) which is part of the Sermon on the Mount, and the other in the Gospel of Luke (Chapter 11: verses 2-4).
Music.
Many composers have written musical scores of the prayer. Some of them are
Luigi Cherubini, Martin Luther, E Nomine, Die Toten Hosen, Charles Gounod, Leoš Janáček, Franz Liszt, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Otto Nicolai, Bernardino Rizzi, Igor Strawinski, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Leonard Bernstein (in Mass) and Giuseppe Verdi.
The probably most modern version was done by Söhne Mannheims in 2004.
