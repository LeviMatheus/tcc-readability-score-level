The Artaxiads (Georgian: არტაშესიანი, Artašesiani), a branch of the dynasty of Armenia that ruled Iberia (ancient Georgia) from c. 90 BC to 30 AD. Little is known about the early years of the Iberian Artaxiad rule. They seem to have been under the influence of their Armenian cousins to whom Iberia had gotten a significant portion of its territory. In 65 BC, their kingdom was attacked by Rome and the dynasty was forced to sign a peace treaty.
