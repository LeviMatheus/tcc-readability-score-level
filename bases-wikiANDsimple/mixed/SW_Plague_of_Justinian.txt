The Plague of Justinian was a pandemic in the Byzantine Empire in the years 541â€“542 AD. Its capital Constantinople suffered as well. It is estimated that the Plague of Justinian killed as many as 100 million people across the world, because it returned about every twelve years till 770 when it stopped for about 500 years.
It caused Europe's population to drop by around 50% between 541 and 700. It also may have contributed to the success of the Muslim conquests.
Its social and cultural impact is comparable to that of the Black Death.
