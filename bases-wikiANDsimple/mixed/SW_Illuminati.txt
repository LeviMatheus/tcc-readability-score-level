The Illuminati Order or Bavarian Illuminati was a short-lived secret group based in Ingolstadt, Germany. It was started on May 1, 1776 by Adam Weishaupt and Baron Adolph von Knigge. The members were mostly Freemasons and former Freemasons.
At that time the state of Bavaria was under the Roman Catholic Church and the aristocracy. Therefore, in 1784, the Bavarian government banned the Illuminati as well as Freemasonry.
