Ritchies is the largest independent supermarket group in the IGA network. It was started in 1870 by Thomas Ritchie who opened a food store in the tiny country village of Frankston.
It is almost 138 years old. With a long and successful heritage, it claims the title of Australia's largest independent supermarket and liquor group which workers have put money in.
The "shilling for every pound" formula has been translated into the Community Benefit scheme. Ritchies now donates many millions of dollars each year to many places as chosen by shoppers. The focus is on the community, which is why the group uses the tagline "Ritchies - where the community benefits".
