The New Testament is part of the Christian Bible, and the most important religious writing of Christianity. It tells the story of Jesus Christ, his followers, and the beginnings of Christianity. It was written in Koine Greek.
Structure.
The New Testament is made of different parts. In total, there are 27 texts in the New Testament. The Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches have the same texts, but their arrangement varies; the Syriac Churches and the Ethiopian Churches have different versions. The Syriac Churches do not put Peter 2, John 2 and 3, Jude and the Revelations in the New Testament. The Ethopian Churches do not have a common canon.
The Four Gospels.
Each of the Gospels tells the story of Jesus Christ, or the Messiah, whom Christians believe is the Son of God who is born to save the world from sin. Each of the Gospels tell this same story, with a little more or less detail from the other.
