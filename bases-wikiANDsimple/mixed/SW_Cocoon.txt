A cocoon is a shell made of silk by moth caterpillars and other insect larvae. Butterfly larvae do not spin a cocoon; their pupal form is called a chrysalis. Some caterpillars attach small twigs or pieces of vegetation to the outside of their cocoon to hide it from predators. Others spin their cocoon in a hidden place- on the underside of a leaf, in a crevice, or down near the base of a tree trunk.
Silkworm cocoons are processed and used to produce natural silk for clothing.
