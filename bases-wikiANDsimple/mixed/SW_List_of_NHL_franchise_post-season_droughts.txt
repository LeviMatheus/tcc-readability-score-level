These are lists of active and all-time NHL team post-season, post-season series win, Stanley Cup Final and Stanley Cup droughts up to and including the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Those teams which have never made it in team history are listed by the season that they entered the league, either as a new team or when they merged into the NHL from the WHA. These lists do not include the canceled 2004â€“05 NHL season.
Post-season droughts.
A post-season drought is continued by not making the NHL playoffs after the regular season. Since the first round of the playoffs consists of 8 series (16 teams) and there are 30 teams in the NHL, there will always be 14 teams in this list.
The other 16 teams - Anaheim Ducks, Boston Bruins, Calgary Flames, Colorado Avalanche, Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, Minnesota Wild, Montreal Canadiens, Nashville Predators, New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers, Ottawa Senators, Philadelphia Flyers, Pittsburgh Penguins, San Jose Sharks, Washington Capitals - all made the post-season for the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs.
Post-season series win droughts.
A post-season series win drought is continued either by not making the playoffs or making the playoffs and losing the first round series. Since the first round of the NHL playoffs consist of 8 series, there will always be 22 teams in this list - 14 teams that don't make the post-season plus the 8 losers of the first round playoffs.
