Non-fiction is writing about facts. Although non-fiction is supposed to be truthful, sometimes it may not be. People normally assume that authors mean to be truthful, but they might make mistakes. Writing is normally split into two parts: non-fiction and fiction. As well as non-fiction books, there are also pictures and films.
