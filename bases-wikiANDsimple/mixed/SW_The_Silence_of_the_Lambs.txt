"The Silence of the Lambs" is a movie directed by Jonathan Demme and starring Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. It is based on the novel by Thomas Harris, which was the second novel about sociopathic psychiatrist and cannibal Dr. Hannibal Lecter. In the movie, Clarice Starling, a young FBI trainee, is sent to see the Dr. Lecter in prison to ask his advice on catching a serial killer called Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill has been abducting women and skinning them.
The movie was released in 1991. Jonathan Demme won an Academy Award for Best Director. Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins both won Oscars (for their playing Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter). The movie also won Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. It is one of the only three movies to win the five most important Academy Awards.
Hopkins' performance as Lecter is one of the shortest lead acting Oscar-winning performances ever, as Hopkins is only on screen for seventeen minutes in the entire movie.
