Arachnophobia is a fear of spiders. It is a very common phobia - many people suffer from it. People who have it usually do not want to go to anywhere they believe there are many spiders and do not want to get near spiders themselves, especially touch them. In many cases, the fear may be because of something that happened with spiders when the sufferer was a small child and may not even remember.
