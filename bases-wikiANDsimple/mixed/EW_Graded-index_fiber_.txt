In fiber optics, a graded index is an optical fiber whose core has a refractive index that decreases with increasing radial distance from the optical axis of the fiber.
Because parts of the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher refractive index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber. The most common refractive index profile for a graded-index fiber is very nearly parabolic. The parabolic profile results in continual refocusing of the rays in the core, and minimizes modal dispersion.
Multi-mode optical fiber can be built with either graded index or step index. The advantage of the multi-mode graded index compared to the multi-mode step index is the considerable decrease in modal dispersion. Modal dispersion can be further decreased by selecting a smaller core size (less than 5-10μm) and forming a single mode step index fiber.
This type of fiber is normalized by the International Telecommunications Union ITU-T at recommendation G.651.1.
Pulse dispersion.
Pulse dispersion in a graded index optical fiber is given by
formula_1     
where
formula_2 is the difference in refractive indices of core and cladding,
formula_3 is the refractive index of the cladding,
formula_4 is the length of the fiber taken for observing the pulse dispersion,
formula_5 is the speed of light, and
formula_6 is the constant of graded index profile.
