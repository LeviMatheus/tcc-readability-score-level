Glass is a hard material that can be made in many shapes. It is usually transparent, but it can also be made in colours.
Glass is often used to make windows and bottles. Many churches have windows made of colored glass.
The word "glass" can also refer to a drink container. It does not have to be made of glass, but can be made of any material, for example plastic.
Glass is used to make lenses. The word "glasses" is often used to mean eyeglasses.
The myth that glass is actually a liquid emanates from the fact that old windows in houses/church's(2-300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape, thicker in the bottom than on the top. However this phenomenon is due to the process of glass manufacture in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one end than the other. It was sensible to install the windows with the thick end at the bottom. Sometimes a window can be found with the thick end at the top of the window.
