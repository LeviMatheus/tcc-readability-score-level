Ghost lights are lights in the air that scientists dont unerstand much and don't know what they are. Ghost lights are not seen much. Ghost light can be close to ground or in the sky. Ghost light close to ground is mostly called "will o' the wisp". Ghost light in the sky is often called UFOs. There are very different kinds of ghost lights. Some are like balls of light, others look like flame, and some look like a bright cloud. Many ghost lights move.
Different cultures have understood ghost lights differently. People believed that they are dragons, spirits or ghosts. Today some believe they are spaceships. There are many theories about what ghost lights are. Some people say they are methane gas that comes from ground and burns in the air. Others say they are electric things like ball lightning. The fact that some animals and fungus glows may explain some ghost lights.
