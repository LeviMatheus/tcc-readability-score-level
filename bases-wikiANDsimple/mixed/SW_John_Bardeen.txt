Bardeen was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Charles Bardeen was a Professor at the Medical School of the University of Wisconsin. He completed his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He completed his Ph.D. in Physics from Princeton University in 1936.
Bardeen, together with William Shockley and Walter Brattain, invented the transistor on December 23, 1947. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 for inventing transistor.
Bardeen worked together with Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer created the standard theory of superconductivity known as the BCS theory, named after them. For this work they shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1972.
Bardeen was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1951 to 1991.
