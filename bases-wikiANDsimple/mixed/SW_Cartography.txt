Cartography is making maps. Cartography is part of geography.
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using computers.
Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a census of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps.
