A ferry is a ship or boat that is used to take people, vehicles or goods across water. Ferries are used across seas, lakes and rivers. Some places in the world can only be reached by ferry, because they have no roads or railways, nor any airports at which to land aeroplanes.
Sometimes the trip in a ferry is free, and sometimes it must be paid for.
The word 'ferry' can also mean 'to take someone or something by ferry'.
