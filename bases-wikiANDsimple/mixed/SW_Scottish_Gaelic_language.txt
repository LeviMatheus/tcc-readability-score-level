It is also related to the Welsh language, Cornish language and the Breton language (these three are Brittonic or Brythonic
History.
In past times, the language was spoken across all of Scotland, except for the Northern Islands (Orkney and Shetland). In the later part of the Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland began to speak the English language, and looked down on the Scottish language. After the union of England and Scotland, the language was snubbed and looked down on even more. The English language took over.
Scottish Gaelic today.
Today, it is spoken only by about 60,000 people in Scotland and perhaps 1,000-2,000 in Nova Scotia, Canada. Only the Western Isles of Scotland have more people who can speak the language than not (61% of the people here speak Gaelic). The place in Scotland with the biggest percentage of Scottish Gaelic speakers is a village called Barvas on the Isle of Lewis. Here, 74.7% of the people there speak the language. Gaelic is dying out, but many people are starting to learn the language.
