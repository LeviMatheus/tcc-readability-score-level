Influenza (or the flu, the grippe) is a very common disease. It is contagious, so it passes from one person to another very easily. Usually, it spreads around the world in seasonal epidemics. In the 20th century, there were three big epidemics (called "pandemics") that killed millions of people. A type of flu is Avian flu. People sometimes mistook influenza for the common cold. The flu affects the upper airways and the lungs.
While there is no cure, there is a vaccine that must be given yearly to avoid infection.
