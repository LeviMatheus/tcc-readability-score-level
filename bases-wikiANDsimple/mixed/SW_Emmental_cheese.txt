Emmental cheese (sometimes also called Emmentaler or Emmenthal) is a Swiss cheese. It first came from Switzerland. It is named after the "Emmental", the valley of a river, near Berne. Emmental cheese was first made around 1293 in that region. Today, there are several different kinds of cheese with that name, made all over the world.
Emmental cheese is amongst the best-known types of cheese. It is made from the milk of cows. One of the features that makes Emmental different from other cheeses is its holes. These holes are there because of the way the cheese is made. The bacteria which produce the cheese have enough time (usually several months) to create bubbles of carbon dioxide gas.
Today, Switzerland, France, Austria, and Germany produce Emmental cheeses that have a Protected Designation of Origin.
Emmental is produced in loaves of 70-80kg. Usually, Emmental cheese is left to ripen for a period of 6-7 weeks. Ripening it for 8-12 weeks gives a more spicy (salty) cheese. In Europe, about 464 200 tons of Emmental are produced each year. This means that about 6% of the total amount of milk these countries produce is used to make Emmental cheese. France is the biggest producer of Emmental. In 2005, 247 069 tons were produced there. For this, 13.1% of national milk production was used. About 19% of the production was exported.
French people and Swiss people eat the most of this kind of cheese, about 3.3 kg per person per year. Germans eat about half that amount, 1.7 kg per person, per year.
Emmental is also widely used in convenience food products, because it is so widely known.
