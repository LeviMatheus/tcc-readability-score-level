Ontology is the part of philosophy that studies existence. Ontology is one of the basic areas of study of philosophy.
Philosophers (people who study philosophy) who are interested in ontology think about what exists, how many things exist, and what existence is. Plato and Aristotle are two people who thought carefully about these questions.
