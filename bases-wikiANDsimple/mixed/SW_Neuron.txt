Neurons are also called nerve cells. Neurons are the basic units of the nervous system and its most important part, the brain.
Every neuron has a cell body (called a soma) and nerve fibres (called axons and dendrites). There are about 100 billion neurons in the human brain.
Classes.
There are three classes of neurons: afferent neurons, efferent neurons, and interneurons.
Simple neuron classes.
Sensory neurons carry signals from sense organs to the spinal cord and brain
Relay neurons carry messages from one part of the CNS to another
Motor neurons carry signals from the CNS to muscles, motor neurons are connected to the relay neurons. The signal passes between the neurons via synapses.
