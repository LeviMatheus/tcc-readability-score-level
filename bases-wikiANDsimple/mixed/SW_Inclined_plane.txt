An inclined plane is a simple machine. It allows one to use less force to move an object.
Examples of inclined planes are ramps, sloping roads and hills, plows, chisels, hatchets, air hammers, carpenter's planes, and wedges. The typical example of an inclined plane is a sloped surface; for example a roadway to bridge a height difference.
Another simple machine based on the inclined plane is the blade, in which two inclined planes placed back to back allow the two parts of the cut object to move apart using less force than would be needed to pull them apart in opposite directions.
