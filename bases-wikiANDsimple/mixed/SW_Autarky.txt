Autarky is an economy that does no trade with the outside world. It is called a self sufficient economy or a closed economy too. It does not need any other countries or regions helping.
Autarky is rare in the modern world. An example of a currently run autarky is North Korea, but even it makes a small amount trade between some countries, like China and Japan.
