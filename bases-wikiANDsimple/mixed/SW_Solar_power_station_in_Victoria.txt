A big new Solar power station in Victoria is planned.
A company called Solar Systems has announced a large 154 MW photovoltaic (PV) solar power station for north-western Victoria. The A$420 million project will provide enough electricity for more than 45,000 homes. It will create jobs and will also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Full completion is expected in 2013, with the first stage to be finished by 2010.
Four smaller solar power stations have already been built in central Australia.
