"Canuck" is a slang term for Canadian people.
Meaning.
The Random House Dictionary says that: "The term Canuck is first recorded about 1835 as an Americanism, originally referring specifically to a French Canadian. This was probably the original meaning, though in Canada and other countries, Canuck now more often refers to any Canadian."
Usage and examples.
When "Canuck" is used by Canadians, the meaning is usually affectionate, friendly or patriotic.
The use of "Canuck" is similar to the use of some other potentially offensive nicknames. When it is used by the people it names — Canadians in this case — it is usually acceptable. But when it is used by an outsider — in this case particularly Americans — it can be thought of as insulting one's heritage. Although it is not as severe as most ethnic slurs, some consider it one - just as Yankee can be.
