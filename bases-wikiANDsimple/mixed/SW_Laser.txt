A LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a machine that makes a very intense beam of light. It works by light being made brighter by lots of its energy being reflected many times. The first working laser was displayed on May 16, 1960 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories.. Since then, it has many commercial and industrial uses, like in factories and computers. It is also used a lot in science fiction writing and films.
One use of lasers is in optical disc drives used in computers, compact disc and DVD players, in which the laser (a few millimeters in size) looks at the surface of the disc. Other uses of lasers are in bar code readers, laser printers and laser pointers.

A laser light is made up of a single wave length with all the waves lined up. Laser light stays in a straight, concentrated beam. Lasers also produce frequencies beyond the visible light range, so a laser beam is not always seen by the eye.
