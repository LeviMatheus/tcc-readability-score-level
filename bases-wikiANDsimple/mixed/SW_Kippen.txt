Kippen is a small village approximately west of the city of Stirling, Scotland (also referred to as the Kingdom of Kippen). It lies between the Gargunnock and Fintry hills and overlooks the strath of the River Forth. The name probably comes from Gaelic, and means "Place of the little stump", "outcrop" or "block".
