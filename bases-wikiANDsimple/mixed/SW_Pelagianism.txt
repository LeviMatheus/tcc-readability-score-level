Pelagianism is a theory named after Pelagius. It is the belief that people are not born with original sin and that mortal will is still capable of choosing good or evil without Divine aid. For this reason, Adam's sin was there to set a bad example for those that came after him; other than that it had no consequences. Jesus was there to set a good example, much like Adam's bad example; but again without consequences. Christians that do not follow Pelagianism today believe that Jesus' death was special, in some way. Pelagians do not believe that.
Pelagianism was condemned as heresy at the Council of Ephesus in 431. Today there are no Pelagians left
