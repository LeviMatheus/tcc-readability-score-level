"Partisan Review" was an American political and literary quarterly published from 1934 to 2003, though it suspended publication between October 1936 and December 1937. It was founded by William Phillips and Philip Rahv. It grew out of the John Reed Club as an alternative to "New Masses", the publication of the American Communist Party, but became anti-Communist after Stalin. Many of its early authors were the children of Jewish immigrants from Europe. The journal reached its peak influence from the late 1930s to the early 1960s, but then gradually lost its relevance to modern American culture. Phillips died in September 2002 at age 94. The journal continued under his wife Edith Kurzweil until April 2003.
In 1949, "Partisan Review" awarded George Orwell Â£357 for the year's most significant contribution to literature, "Nineteen Eighty-Four".
