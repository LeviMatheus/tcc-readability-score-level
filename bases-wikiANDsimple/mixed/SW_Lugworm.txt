The lugworm or sandworm is a large marine worm of the phylum Annelida. Its coiled castings are a familiar sight on a beach at low tide but the animal itself is not seen except by those who, from curiosity or to use as fishing bait, dig the worm out of the sand.
The animal can grow to a size of about 9 inches (22 cm). Its body is segmented, like that of an earhworm. It has bristles in the middle part. It is a polychaete. It also has well-developed blood-wessels, and gills to breathe in the water.
The lugworm lives under sand in a 'U' shape.From one side it sucks the sand and gets the nutrients and little creatures and releases the unwanted sand from the other side.
