Ulysses S. Grant (April 27, 1822 - July 23, 1885), born Hiram Ulysses Grant, was the general who won the American Civil War and later became the 18th President of the United States (1869-1887).
Before becoming the president he was the top general in the Union Army. Since he was able to do well fighting in the American Civil War he gained popularity which would helped him to become president later on.
His presidency suffered from a number of scandals and is thought to be one of the worst by many historians.
