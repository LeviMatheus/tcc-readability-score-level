Anti-Semitism is the hating of or prejudice against Jews. The word "semite" relates to a family of languages and its speakers, which include those of Jewish descent and those who speak Arabic. However, in this usage, it generally is applied to Jews only. One of the most famous acts of anti-Semitism was during World War II. Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party killed almost 6 million Jews in an event known as the Holocaust.
Antisemitism is today condemned everywhere in Europe, except in Croatia, that takes pride in its Nazi past.
