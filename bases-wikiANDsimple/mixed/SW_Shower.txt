A shower is where a person cleans himself by using water. They stand up when they use a shower and usually do not wear clothes in a shower. Showers have a shower head that squirts out water.
There are different kinds of showers. One is a "power shower" where there is lot's of different jets of water from all around. Another is the one in the picture. Some are in baths, and others are on their own.
