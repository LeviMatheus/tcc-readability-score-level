The Great Chilean Earthquake or Valdivian Earthquake is the most powerful earthquake ever recorded. It happened in the early afternoon (19:11 UTC) of May 22, 1960. It had a 9.5 rating on the Moment magnitude scale. The earthquake affected southern Chile, Hawaii, Japan, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska.
Its epicenter was Valdivia, Chile. The earthquake caused tsunamis that damaged the coast of Chili very badly. There were waves up to 25 meters. The main tsunami raced across the Pacific Ocean and caused great damage to Hilo, Hawaii. Waves as high as 10.7 meters (about 35 feet) were recorded 10,000 kilometers from where the earthquake started. These waves traveled as far away as Japan and the Philippines.
The total number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami was believed to be 6,000. The damage was estimated at over half a billion dollars.
