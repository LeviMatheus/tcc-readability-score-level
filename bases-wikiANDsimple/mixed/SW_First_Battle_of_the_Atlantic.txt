The First Battle of the Atlantic (1914â€“1918) was a naval campaign of World War I, largely fought in the seas around the British Isles and in the Atlantic Ocean. Both the German Empire and United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed their population and supply their war industry; thus both aimed to blockade each other. The British had the Royal Navy which was superior in numbers and could operate within the British Empire. The German fleet mainly used unrestricted submarine warfare. The successful blockade of Germany contributed to its military defeat in 1918, and still in effect, enforced also the signing of the Versailles Treaty in mid-1919.
Allied and Neutral Tonnage sunk by submarines in World War I.
Note that unrestricted submarine warfare was resumed in February 1917 and the British began full-scale convoying in September 1917. The heaviest losses were suffered in April 1917 when a record 881,027 tons were sunk by the U-boats.
