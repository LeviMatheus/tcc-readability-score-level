Strasbourg (, , ; , ; ) is the prefecture and largest city of the Grand Est region of Eastern France and the official seat of the European Parliament. Located at the border with Germany in the historic region of Alsace, it is the prefecture of the Bas-Rhin department.
In 2018, the city proper had 284,677 inhabitants and both the Eurométropole de Strasbourg (Greater Strasbourg) and the Arrondissement of Strasbourg had 500,510 inhabitants. Strasbourg's metropolitan area had a population of 790,087 in 2017 (not counting the section across the border in Germany), making it the ninth-largest metro area in France and home to 13% of the Grand Est region's inhabitants. The transnational Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau had a population of 958,421 inhabitants. Strasbourg is one of the "de facto" four main capitals of the European Union (alongside Brussels, Luxembourg and Frankfurt), as it is the seat of several European institutions, such as the European Parliament, the Eurocorps and the European Ombudsman of the European Union. An organization separate from the European Union, the Council of Europe (with its European Court of Human Rights, its European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines most commonly known in French as "Pharmacopée Européenne", and its European Audiovisual Observatory) is also located in the city.
Together with Basel (Bank for International Settlements), Geneva (United Nations), The Hague (International Court of Justice) and New York City (United Nations world headquarters), Strasbourg is among the few cities in the world that is not a state capital that hosts international organisations of the first order. The city is the seat of many non-European international institutions such as the Central Commission for Navigation on the Rhine and the International Institute of Human Rights. It is the second city in France in terms of international congress and symposia, after Paris. Strasbourg's historic city centre, the "Grande Île" (Grand Island), was classified a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. Strasbourg is immersed in Franco-German culture and although violently disputed throughout history, has been a cultural bridge between France and Germany for centuries, especially through the University of Strasbourg, currently the second-largest in France, and the coexistence of Catholic and Protestant culture. It is also home to the largest Islamic place of worship in France, the Strasbourg Grand Mosque.
Economically, Strasbourg is an important centre of manufacturing and engineering, as well as a hub of road, rail, and river transportation. The port of Strasbourg is the second-largest on the Rhine after Duisburg in Germany, and the second-largest river port in France after Paris.
Etymology and names.
Before the 5th century BC, the city was known as "Argantorati" (in the nominative, "Argantorate" in the locative), a Celtic Gaulish name Latinised first as "Argentorate" (with Gaulish locative ending, as appearing on the first Roman milestones in the 1st century BC) and then as "Argentoratum" (with regular Latin nominative ending, in later Latin texts). That Gaulish name is a compound of "-rati", the Gaulish word for fortified enclosures, cognate to the Old Irish "ráth" (see ringfort) and "arganto(n)-" (cognate to Latin "argentum", which gave modern French "argent"), the Gaulish word for silver, but also any precious metal, particularly gold, suggesting either a fortified enclosure located by a river gold mining site, or hoarding gold mined in the nearby rivers.
After the 5th century AD, the city became known by a completely different name Gallicized as Strasbourg (Lower Alsatian: "Strossburi"; ). That name is of Germanic origin and means 'town (at the crossing) of roads'. The modern "Stras-" is cognate to the German "Straße" and English "street", all of which are derived from Latin "strata" ("paved road"), while "-bourg" is cognate to the German "Burg" and English "borough", all of which are derived from Proto-Germanic "*burgz" ("hill fort, fortress").
Gregory of Tours was the first to mention the name change: in the tenth book of his "History of the Franks" written shortly after 590 he said that Egidius, Bishop of Reims, accused of plotting against King Childebert II of Austrasia in favor of his uncle King Chilperic I of Neustria, was tried by a synod of Austrasian bishops in Metz in November 590, found guilty and removed from the priesthood, then taken "ad Argentoratensem urbem, quam nunc Strateburgum vocant" ("to the city of Argentoratum, which they now call "Strateburgus""), where he was exiled.
Geography.
Location.
Strasbourg is situated at the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the Rhine, which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town Kehl. The historic core of Strasbourg, however, lies on the Grande Île in the river Ill, which here flows parallel to, and roughly from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.
The city lies in the Upper Rhine Plain, at between and above sea level, with the upland areas of the Vosges Mountains some to the west and the Black Forest to the east. This section of the Rhine valley is a major axis of north–south travel, with river traffic on the Rhine itself, and major roads and railways paralleling it on both banks.
The city is some east of Paris. The mouth of the Rhine lies approximately to the north, or as the river flows, whilst the head of navigation in Basel is some to the south, or by river.
Climate.
In spite of its position far inland, Strasbourg has an oceanic climate (Köppen: "Cfb"), though with less maritime influence than the milder climates of Western and Southern France. The city has warm, relatively sunny summers and cool, overcast winters. Precipitation is elevated from mid-spring to the end of summer, but remains largely constant throughout the year, totaling annually. On average, snow falls 30 days per year.
The second highest temperature ever recorded was in August 2003, during the 2003 European heat wave. This record was broken, on June 30, 2019, when it reached . The lowest temperature ever recorded was in December 1938.
Strasbourg's location in the Rhine valley, sheltered from strong winds by the Vosges and Black Forest mountains, results in poor natural ventilation, making Strasbourg one of the most atmospherically polluted cities of France. Nonetheless, the progressive disappearance of heavy industry on both banks of the Rhine, as well as effective measures of traffic regulation in and around the city have reduced air pollution in recent years.
History.
The Roman camp of Argentoratum was first mentioned in 12 BC; the city of Strasbourg which grew from it celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1988. The fertile area in the Upper Rhine Plain between the rivers Ill and Rhine had already been populated since the Middle Paleolithic.
Between 362 and 1262, Strasbourg was governed by the bishops of Strasbourg; their rule was reinforced in 873 and then more in 982. In 1262, the citizens violently rebelled against the bishop's rule (Battle of Hausbergen) and Strasbourg became a free imperial city. It became a French city in 1681, after the conquest of Alsace by the armies of Louis XIV. In 1871, after the Franco-Prussian War, the city became German again, until 1918 (end of World War I), when it reverted to France. After the defeat of France in 1940 (World War II), Strasbourg came under German control again; since the end of 1944, it is again a French city. In 2016, Strasbourg was promoted from capital of Alsace to capital of Grand Est.
Strasbourg played an important part in Protestant Reformation, with personalities such as John Calvin, Martin Bucer, Wolfgang Capito, Matthew and Katharina Zell, but also in other aspects of Christianity such as German mysticism, with Johannes Tauler, Pietism, with Philipp Spener, and Reverence for Life, with Albert Schweitzer. Delegates from the city took part in the Protestation at Speyer. It was also one of the first centres of the printing industry with pioneers such as Johannes Gutenberg, Johannes Mentelin, and Heinrich Eggestein. Among the darkest periods in the city's long history were the years 1349 (Strasbourg massacre), 1518 (Dancing plague), 1793 (Reign of Terror), 1870 (Siege of Strasbourg) and the years 1940–1944 with the Nazi occupation (atrocities such as the Jewish skeleton collection) and the British and American bombing raids. Some other notable dates were the years 357 (Battle of Argentoratum), 842 (Oaths of Strasbourg), 1538 (establishment of the university), 1605 (world's first newspaper printed by Johann Carolus), 1792 (La Marseillaise), and 1889 (pancreatic origin of diabetes discovered by Minkowski and Von Mering).
Strasbourg has been the seat of European Institutions since 1949: first of the International Commission on Civil Status and of the Council of Europe, later of the European Parliament, of the European Science Foundation, of Eurocorps, and others as well.
Districts.
Strasbourg is divided into the following districts:
Main sights.
Architecture.
The city is chiefly known for its sandstone Gothic Cathedral with its famous astronomical clock, and for its medieval cityscape of Rhineland black and white timber-framed buildings, particularly in the "Petite France" district or "Gerberviertel" ("tanners' district") alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned "Maison Kammerzell" stands out.
Notable medieval streets include "Rue Mercière", "Rue des Dentelles", "Rue du Bain aux Plantes", "Rue des Juifs", "Rue des Frères", "Rue des Tonneliers", "Rue du Maroquin", "Rue des Charpentiers", "Rue des Serruriers", "Grand' Rue", "Quai des Bateliers", "Quai Saint-Nicolas" and "Quai Saint-Thomas".
Notable medieval squares include "Place de la Cathédrale", "Place du Marché Gayot", "Place Saint-Étienne", "Place du Marché aux Cochons de Lait" and "Place Benjamin Zix".
In addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the Romanesque "Église Saint-Étienne", partly destroyed in 1944 by Allied bombing raids; the part-Romanesque, part-Gothic, very large "Église Saint-Thomas" with its Silbermann organ on which Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Albert Schweitzer played; the Gothic "Église protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune" with its crypt dating back to the seventh century and its cloister partly from the eleventh century; the Gothic "Église Saint-Guillaume" with its fine early-Renaissance stained glass and furniture; the Gothic "Église Saint-Jean"; the part-Gothic, part-Art Nouveau "Église Sainte-Madeleine" etc.
The Neo-Gothic church "Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique" (there is also an adjacent church "Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant") serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood-worked and painted altars coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display; especially the Passion of Christ.
Among the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental "Ancienne Douane" (old custom-house) stands out.
The German Renaissance has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially the current "Chambre de commerce et d'industrie", former town hall, on "Place Gutenberg"), as did the French Baroque and Classicism with several "hôtels particuliers" (i.e. palaces), among which the "Palais Rohan" (1742, now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Other buildings of its kind are the "Hôtel de Hanau" (1736, now the city hall); the "Hôtel de Klinglin" (1736, now residence of the préfet); the "Hôtel des Deux-Ponts" (1755, now residence of the military governor); the "Hôtel d'Andlau-Klinglin" (1725, now seat of the administration of the Port autonome de Strasbourg) etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the 1720s main building of the "Hôpital civil".
As for French Neo-classicism, it is the Opera House on Place Broglie that most prestigiously represents this style.
Strasbourg also offers high-class eclecticist buildings in its very extended German district, the "Neustadt", being the main memory of Wilhelmian architecture since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damage during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to seven stories) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this architectural style that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, Neo-Greek and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace "Palais du Rhin", the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the "École internationale des Pontonniers" (the former "Höhere Mädchenschule", with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles and the "Haute école des arts du Rhin" with its lavishly ornate façade of painted bricks, woodwork and majolica.
Notable streets of the German district include: "Avenue de la Forêt Noire", "Avenue des Vosges", "Avenue d'Alsace", "Avenue de la Marseillaise", "Avenue de la Liberté", "Boulevard de la Victoire", "Rue Sellénick", "Rue du Général de Castelnau", "Rue du Maréchal Foch", and "Rue du Maréchal Joffre". Notable squares of the German district include "Place de la République", "Place de l'Université", "Place Brant", and "Place Arnold".
Impressive examples of Prussian military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly reopened "Rue du Rempart", displaying large-scale fortifications among which the aptly named "Kriegstor" (war gate).
As for modern and contemporary architecture, Strasbourg possesses some fine Art Nouveau buildings (such as the huge "Palais des Fêtes" and houses and villas like "Villa Schutzenberger" and "Hôtel Brion"), good examples of post-World War II functional architecture (the "Cité Rotterdam", for which Le Corbusier did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended "Quartier Européen", some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the European Court of Human Rights building by Richard Rogers is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new Music school "Cité de la Musique et de la Danse", the "Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain" and the "Hôtel du Département" facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station Hoenheim-Nord designed by Zaha Hadid.
The city has many bridges, including the medieval and four-towered "Ponts Couverts" that, despite their name, are no longer covered. Next to the "Ponts Couverts" is the "Barrage Vauban", a part of Vauban's 17th-century fortifications, that does include a covered bridge. Other bridges are the ornate 19th-century "Pont de la Fonderie" (1893, stone) and "Pont d'Auvergne" (1892, iron), as well as architect 's futuristic "Passerelle" over the Rhine, opened in 2004.
The largest square at the centre of the city of Strasbourg is the Place Kléber. Located in the heart of the city's commercial area, it was named after general Jean-Baptiste Kléber, born in Strasbourg in 1753 and assassinated in 1800 in Cairo. In the square is a statue of Kléber, under which is a vault containing his remains. On the north side of the square is the Aubette (Orderly Room), built by Jacques François Blondel, architect of the king, in 1765–1772.
Parks.
Strasbourg features a number of prominent parks, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the "Parc de l'Orangerie", laid out as a French garden by André le Nôtre and remodeled as an English garden on behalf of Joséphine de Beauharnais, now displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small zoo; the "Parc de la Citadelle", built around impressive remains of the 17th-century fortress erected close to the Rhine by Vauban; the "Parc de Pourtalès", laid out in English style around a baroque castle (heavily restored in the 19th century) that now houses a small three-star hotel, and featuring an open-air museum of international contemporary sculpture.
The Jardin botanique de l'Université de Strasbourg (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the Observatory of Strasbourg, built in 1881, and still owns some greenhouses of those times. The "Parc des Contades", although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic "Parc des Poteries" is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The "Jardin des deux Rives", spread over Strasbourg and Kehl on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is "Parc du Heyritz" (8,7 ha), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the "hôpital civil".
Museums.
As of 2020, the city of Strasbourg has eleven municipal museums (including "Aubette 1928"), eleven university museums, and at least two privately owned museums ("Musée vodou" and "Musée du barreau de Strasbourg"). Five communes in the metropolitan area also have museums (see below), three of them dedicated to military history.
Overview.
The collections in Strasbourg are distributed over a wide range of museums, according to a system that takes into account not only the types and geographical provenances of the items, but also the epochs. This concerns in particular the following domains:
University museums.
The Université de Strasbourg is in charge of a number of permanent public displays of its collections of scientific artefacts and products of all kinds of exploration and research.
Demographics.
The commune of Strasbourg proper had a population of 284,677 on 1 January 2018, the result of a constant moderate annual growth which is also reflected in the constant growth of the number of students at its university (e. g. from 42,000 students in 2010 to 52,000 students in 2019). The metropolitan area of Strasbourg had a population of 785,839 inhabitants in 2016 (French side of the border only), while the transnational Eurodistrict had a population of 958,421 inhabitants.
In the Middle Ages, Strasbourg (a Free imperial city since 1262), was an important town. According to a 1444 census, the population was circa 20,000; only one third less than Cologne, then a major European city.
Culture.
Strasbourg is the seat of internationally renowned institutions of music and drama:
Other theatres are the "Théâtre jeune public", the "TAPS Scala", the "Kafteur" ...  
Education.
Universities and tertiary education.
Strasbourg, well known as centre of humanism, has a long history of excellence in higher-education, at the crossroads of French and German intellectual traditions. Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century, and the university attracted numerous students from the Holy Roman Empire, with Goethe, Metternich and Montgelas, who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. With 19 Nobel prizes in total, Strasbourg is the most eminent French university outside of Paris.
Up until January 2009, there were three universities in Strasbourg, with an approximate total of 48,500 students (another 4,500 students are being taught at one of the diverse post-graduate schools):
As of 1 January 2009, those three universities have merged and now constitute the Université de Strasbourg.
Schools part of the Université de Strasbourg include:
Primary and secondary education.
International schools include:
Multiple levels:
For elementary education:
For middle school/junior high school education:
For senior high school/sixth form college:
Libraries.
The Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire (BNU) is, with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles, the second-largest library in France after the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It was founded by the German administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students' and a national library. The Strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as "City Hall" in a French commercial map, which had been captured and used by the German artillery to lay their guns. A librarian from Munich later pointed out "...that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a German artillery officer, who used the French map, but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a Frenchman."
The municipal library Bibliothèque municipale de Strasbourg (BMS) administrates a network of ten medium-sized librairies in different areas of the town. A six stories high "Grande bibliothèque", the "Médiathèque André Malraux", was inaugurated on 19 September 2008 and is considered the largest in Eastern France.
Incunabula.
As one of the earliest centers of book-printing in Europe (see above: History), Strasbourg for a long time held a large number of incunabula — books printed before 1500 — in its library as one of its most precious heritages: no less than 7,000. After the total destruction of this institution in 1870, however, a new collection had to be reassembled from scratch. Today, Strasbourg's different public and institutional libraries again display a sizable total number of incunabula, distributed as follows: "Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire", ca. 2,120, "Médiathèque de la ville et de la communauté urbaine de Strasbourg", 349, "Bibliothèque du Grand Séminaire", 238, "Médiathèque protestante", 66, and "Bibliothèque alsatique du Crédit Mutuel", 5.
Transportation.
Train services operate from the "Gare de Strasbourg", the city's main station in the city centre, eastward to Offenburg and Karlsruhe in Germany, westward to Metz and Paris, and southward to Basel. Strasbourg's links with the rest of France have improved due to its recent connection to the TGV network, with the first phase of the TGV "Est" (Paris–Strasbourg) in 2007, the TGV "Rhin-Rhône" (Strasbourg-Lyon) in 2012, and the second phase of the TGV Est in July 2016.
Strasbourg also has its own airport, serving major domestic destinations as well as international destinations in Europe and northern Africa. The airport is linked to the "Gare de Strasbourg" by a frequent train service.
City transportation in Strasbourg includes the futurist-looking Strasbourg tramway that opened in 1994 and is operated by the regional transit company Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois (CTS), consisting of 6 lines with a total length of . The CTS also operates a comprehensive bus network throughout the city that is integrated with the trams. With more than of bicycle paths, biking in the city is convenient and the CTS operates a cheap bike-sharing scheme named "Vélhop"'. The CTS, and its predecessors, also operated a previous generation of tram system between 1878 and 1960, complemented by trolleybus routes between 1939 and 1962.
Being a city on the Ill and close to the Rhine, Strasbourg has always been an important centre of fluvial navigation, as is attested by archeological findings. In 1682 the "Canal de la Bruche" was added to the river navigations, initially to provide transport for sandstone from quarries in the Vosges for use in the fortification of the city. That canal has since closed, but the subsequent "Canal du Rhone au Rhine", "Canal de la Marne au Rhin" and "Grand Canal d'Alsace" are still in use, as is the important activity of the "Port autonome de Strasbourg". Water tourism inside the city proper attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.
The tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it. The centre has been transformed into a pedestrian priority zone that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of "filtered permeability" to the existing irregular network of streets. It means that the network adaptations favour active transportation and, selectively, "filter out" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip. This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the Fused Grid.
At present the A35 autoroute, which parallels the Rhine between Karlsruhe and Basel, and the A4 autoroute, which links Paris with Strasbourg, penetrate close to the centre of the city. The "Grand contournement ouest" (GCO) project, programmed since 1999, plans to construct a highway connection between the junctions of the A4 and the A35 autoroutes in the north and of the A35 and A352 autoroutes in the south. This routes well to the west of the city and is meant to divest a significant portion of motorized traffic from the unité urbaine. The GCO project is opposed by environmentalists, who created a ZAD (or Zone to Defend).
Strasbourg Public Transportation Statistics.
The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Strasbourg, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 52 min. 7% of public transit riders, ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 9 min, while 11% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 0% travel for over in a single direction.
European role.
Institutions.
Strasbourg is the seat of over twenty international institutions, most famously of the Council of Europe and of the European Parliament, of which it is the official seat. Strasbourg is considered the legislative and democratic capital of the European Union, while Brussels is considered the executive and administrative capital and Luxembourg the judiciary and financial capital.
Strasbourg is the seat of the following organisations, among others:
Eurodistrict.
France and Germany have created a Eurodistrict straddling the Rhine, combining the Greater Strasbourg and the Ortenau district of Baden-Württemberg, with some common administration. It was established in 2005 and has been fully functional since 2010.
Sports.
Sporting teams from Strasbourg are the Racing Club de Strasbourg Alsace (football), SIG Strasbourg (basketball) and the Étoile Noire (ice hockey). The women's tennis Internationaux de Strasbourg is one of the most important French tournaments of its kind outside Roland-Garros. In 1922, Strasbourg was the venue for the XVI Grand Prix de l'A.C.F. which saw Fiat battle Bugatti, Ballot, Rolland Pilain, and Britain's Aston Martin and Sunbeam.
