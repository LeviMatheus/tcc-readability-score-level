In biology, especially in electrophysiology, a signal or biopotential is an electric quantity (voltage or current or field strength), that is caused by chemical reactions of charged ions. Another use of the term lies in describing the transfer of information between and within cells, as in signal transduction. Biological signals can also be seen as an example of signal (electrical engineering).
