In grammar, a lexical category (also word class, lexical class, or part of speech) is a type of word. (The word 'lexical' means "relating to the vocabulary of a language"). There are many different lexical categories, but the most common ones are the noun, pronoun, verb, adjective, adverb, preposition, interjection and conjunction. The noun is a person, place, or thing. Nouns with capital letters are proper nouns, such as "London" or "Fred". A pronoun is a thing, such as "you", or "he" - a quick way to repeat a noun. An adjective describes a noun. An adverb describes an adjective, verb, or another adverb. A verb is an action word. An interjection is a word which shows emotions, such as "wow". Conjunctions, such as "and" or "or", join two clauses or form lists.
