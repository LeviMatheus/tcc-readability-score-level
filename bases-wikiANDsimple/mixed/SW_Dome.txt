A dome is a feature of architecture that usually looks like the upper half of a sphere on top of a building.
It is a feature that makes many religious and government buildings stand out, because if someone is speaking to others inside or under a dome, the voice sounds louder. Also a dome makes it easier to identify an important building, for example a temple or a palace.
