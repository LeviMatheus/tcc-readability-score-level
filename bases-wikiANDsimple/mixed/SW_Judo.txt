Judo, meaning "Gentle Way" comes from the ancient Samurai art in Japan, named "Jujitsu".
Jujitsu was a deadly art that used chokes, throws, joint locks, and strikes to knock out or kill opponents. Kano Jigoro who created Judo, took the safest techniques from Jujitsu and combined them to create this new Japanese martial art.
Judo is very scientific in its training methods and fighting techniques.
