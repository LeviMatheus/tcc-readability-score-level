Soil erosion (or simply erosion) is the washing or blowing away (by the wind) of the top layer of soil (dirt).
This is a serious problem for people who want to grow crops.
Crops are the foods that farmers grow.
If the soil has eroded, the crops will not grow very well.
Erosion also leaves large holes in the earth, which can weaken buildings and even cause them to collapse. Another type of erosion is called Decomposition and is when waves wash away sand and other material from cliffs or beaches.
Prevention.
Soil erosion can be prevented several ways.
