John Dalton (September 5, 1766 â€“ July 27, 1844) was a British chemist and physicist. He was born in England. He made many discoveries about atomic theory.
Dalton's Atomic Theory.
Dalton's Atomic theory is a scientific theory about atoms. Dalton made the theory to explain why elements would combine in certain ways. The idea of atoms was already known at the time, but not widely accepted. Dalton's theory of atoms was based on actual observation. Before this, ideas about atoms were based more on philosophy.
Although not a part of the Dalton's original atomic theory, it is believed that Dalton's atomic theory contained the way that the atoms use to bond together.
