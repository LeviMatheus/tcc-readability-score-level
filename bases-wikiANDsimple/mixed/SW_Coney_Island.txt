Coney Island is a famous area in Brooklyn, New York. It is a peninsula (but it used to be an island). It is famous for its beaches, amusements (like the Cyclone roller coaster and Wonder Wheel ferris wheel), boardwalk, and hot dogs.
We do not know how it got its name for sure. Some people think it is because of its cone shaped like islands. Other say that when the Dutch people arrived, there was a large population of rabbits so they named it "Coney Island" which meant "Rabbit Island" in English at that time. Other people think that it was named after the Irish pirate who named it after one of the islands in Ireland. But who knows? There might be a totally different reason why it was named the "Coney Island".
