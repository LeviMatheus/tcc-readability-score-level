Club Penguin is an online social children's game. Players can make a penguin to be, choose a color for the penguin, and play games to earn money. Players' penguins can buy a pet called a 'puffle', which can be fed and played with. Some things aren't available to all penguins, like buying clothes. This is because a player must pay to be a complete member for their penguin to wear clothes, buy an upgrade for their igloo, and decorate it. However, to be a complete member you must pay a certain amount of real money to the company. Being a regular member does not cost anything. The complete membership can last for 1 month, 6 months, or even a year depending on how much you pay.
