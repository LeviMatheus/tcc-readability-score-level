Koweta Mission Site is a NRHP site added in 1973.
The Koweta Mission was founded in 1843 when white missionaries arrived in Coweta to teach Native American children. Reverend Robert Loughridge and his wife, Olivia, bought an empty cabin for ten dollars and began teaching. He named the mission "Koweta".
