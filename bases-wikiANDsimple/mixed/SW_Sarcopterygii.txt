Sarcopterygii (from Greek "sarx", flesh, and "pteryx", fin) is a taxonomical class of animals. The class is made up of lobe-finned fishes. For example, the lungfish and coelacanths.
Characteristics.
These are bony fishes with paired rounded fins. These fins, being similar to limbs, suggest that these fish may be ancestors of land vertebrates.
Many people who study taxonomy include Tetrapoda within this group. This means the group includes all species of four-limbed vertebrates. The fin-limbs of sarcopterygiians are very similar to what people believe was the ancestral form of tetrapod limbs. This has caused them to be believed to be the direct ancestors of tetrapods in the scientific literature.
