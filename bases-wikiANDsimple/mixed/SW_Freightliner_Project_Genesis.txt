On the 26 November 2007, Freightliner UK and General Electric announced Project Genesis. This will see the design of a new British loading gauge freight locomotive type, currently named Powerhaul', intended to match older types in terms of haulage capacity whilst at the same time being more fuel efficient. The project is intended as a collaborative effort, with Freightliner being involved with the design process from the beginning. In announcing the project, Freightliner also announced that they had ordered a total of 30 units, their largest ever single locomotive order. The order will give GE its first units in service on the British rail network.
