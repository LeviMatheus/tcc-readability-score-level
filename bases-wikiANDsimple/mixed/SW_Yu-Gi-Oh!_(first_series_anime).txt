"Yu-Gi-Oh!" is the title of the first anime series based on the "Yu-Gi-Oh!" manga. It is not connected in any way to the "Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters" series (known internationally as simply Yu-Gi-Oh!). They are 2 different anime series that are based on the same manga series. Fans of Yu-Gi-Oh! use the fan name "Yu-Gi-Oh! A Shadow Game" when talking about this show. They may use "Yu-Gi-Oh! first season" or "zero season" to refer to this show but this is not correct.
The series aired on television from April 4, 1998 to October 10, 1998. It has 27 episodes. It was produced by Toei Animation. The level of violence was reduced between the manga and the anime. Some characters and how the characters acted was changed from the manga. New characters and plots were added and Duel Monsters had a bigger part than in the manga. Unlike the second series, the card game (Duel Monsters) is not the main part of the show.
