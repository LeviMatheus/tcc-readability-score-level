Theology is the study of one or more religions.
Theology may be studied for many reasons. Some study theology to better understand their own religion, while others study theology so that they can compare religions.
The word ‘theology’ was first used to describe the study of the Christian God, but some now use it to describe the study of religion generally, but not everyone agrees that it is right to do so. Some people use the words 'comparative theology' when they want to mean discussing the theology of more than one religion at once.
