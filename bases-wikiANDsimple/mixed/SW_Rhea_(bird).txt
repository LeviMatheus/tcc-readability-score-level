The rheas are species of flightless birds in the genus "Rhea", native to South America.
Description.
The Common Rhea (also called the Nandu) is a large, flightless bird from forests of South America. This ratite is the largest bird in the Americas. The common rhea is a fast runner; when it runs, its neck is almost horizontal to the ground. Rheas congregate in flocks of about 20 to 30 birds.
Diet.
Rheas eat mostly plants, fruits, seeds, and nuts, but also will also eat insects and other small animals (like lizards).
Reproduction.
The female rhea lays 12-30 yellow-cream eggs in a clutch. The male digs the nest (a simple scrape in the ground), incubates the eggs (for 6 weeks), and raises the chicks. Rheas are mature at 2 years of age.
