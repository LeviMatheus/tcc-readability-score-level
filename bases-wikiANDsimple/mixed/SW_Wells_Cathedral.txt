Wells Cathedral is a Cathedral in Wells, Somerset, England. It belongs to the Church of England. It is the seat of the bishop of Bath and Wells. It was built between 1170 and 1490,
Wells Cathedral has been described as “the most poetic of the English Cathedrals”.
Much of the structure is in the Early English style. Many mouldings look almost like sculptures. The carved capitals are done in a foliate style known as “stiff leaf”. This adds to their vitality. The eastern end has kept much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has a splendid Early English façade and a large central tower.
The first church was established on the site in 705. Construction of the present building began in the 10th century and was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239. It was expanded and renovated several times since then and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.
Peter Price is the current Bishop of Bath and Wells having been appointed in 2001; and John Clarke has been the Dean since September 2004.
