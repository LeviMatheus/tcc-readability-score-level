The North Hollywood shootout was a gunfight that happened on Febuary 28, 1997. Emil Matasareanu and Larry Eugene Phillips were the bank robbers, and used AK-47s, an AR-15, an HK-91, and 9 MM pistols. The police could not kill them because of their heavy body armour, which was made out of kevlar. 20 people were wounded, and the only two killed were the robbers.
