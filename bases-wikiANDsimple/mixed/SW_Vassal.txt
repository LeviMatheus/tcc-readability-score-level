A vassal during the feudalism of medieval Europe, was someone who had obligations with a lord. Usually that were military support from his side and protection from the side of his lord. The lord also gave him the terrain that he held as a fief. By analogy the term "vasall" is used also for similar systems in other feudal societies.
Western vassalage.
The development of the "vassal", in a society that was increasingly organised around the concept of "lordship"— in French the "seigneur"— is one sign that Antiquity ended and the Early Middle Ages began. Lordship is the basic social institution as Tacitus described them in his book "Germania". The Roman West experienced them for the first time in the Migration Period.
As the system developed in the seventh century, the vassals were gangs of freemen who subjected themselves, in some degree of formality, to the authority of a leader, from whom they could expect to be fed, clothed and armed. The quality of a vassal was only in his fighting ability and the strength of his loyalty. The etymology of "vassal" is from a Celtic word "gwas" "boy" that meant a young male slave, with a Latinised form, "vassus" that appeared in Salic Law (Rouche 1987 p 429), not unlike the derivation of "knight" from Old English "cniht" and cognates in Frisian and Dutch, all meaning "lad".
