Papa Smurf is the patriarch of smurfland. He is the leader of all the other smurfs. He often times is the one who comes up with a way to stop Gargamel. He is older in appearance that all the other smurfs. There is a theory that he is their father. He is very wise and corrects the other smurfs in their errors.
