Zoo Entertainment was an American record label, and a part of BMG. The label was created in the early 1990s by Lou Maglia, the former president of Island Records. It is now out of operation. Maglia and former BMG executive Kevin Czinger ran Zoo Entertainment and its successor company Volcano Entertainment. When money ran out, Volcano's owners sold the company to Zomba Records. Zomba later entered into a joint venture with Bernstein & Mensch, the rock management company. Zoo is best known for releasing three multi-platinum Tool albums.
