"Rhythm Tengoku Gold" is a music video game made by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console. It is the sequel to "Rhythm Tengoku".
Gameplay.
"Rhythm Heaven" only uses the touch screen on the DS to play the stages. In the stages, the player has to do what the game wants him or her to, like in a level where the player has a song in the background, and has to fill robots with a liquid to send it off. The robot goes on a conveyer belt, and the player has to drop the nozzle to the beat of the music and try to get it to land on its head. Then, the player has to hold it there until the robot fills up and flies away. If the player does it right, he or she gets a perfect hit. If the player overfills, underfills, or barely misses, it's a half-hit. If the player misses completely, it's a miss. At the end, the player is ranked, either getting a Perfect Level, Mediocre, or a Miss. The touch screen can do a lot of stuff, like a "flick" motion where the player flicks in a direction with the stylus or just touch the screen. The first stage has the player flicking a screw using a spring to the beat of the music. At the right moment, the player has to flick the screw into two squares as they roll down the level at the right time to make them come together.
There's a mode called Guitar Lessons that's like the Drum Lessons in "Rhythm Tengoku".
Music.
Like in "Rhythm Tengoku", Tsunku made the music for this game. A soundtrack is going to be released October 15, 2008 with 140 songs from this game and "Rhythm Tengoku", which came before this game.
