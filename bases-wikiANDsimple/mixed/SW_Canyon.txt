A canyon is a big crack in the ground. Many canyons are made by rivers and earthquakes. They can be big, like the Grand Canyon, or small.
Canyons are typically found in the Southwestern U.S.
Canyons can be formed by running water which will take sediment (pieces of the earth) away and create a trench getting deeper until it forms a canyon.
