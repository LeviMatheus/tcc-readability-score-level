Clive Barker (born 5 October 1952) is an English playwright, novelist, film director, and visual artist. Barker came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a series of short stories, the "Books of Blood", which established him as a leading horror writer. He has since written many novels and other works, and his fiction has been adapted into films, notably the "Hellraiser" and "Candyman" series.
He was an executive producer of the film "Gods and Monsters", which won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.
Barker's paintings and illustrations have been featured in galleries in the United States as well as within his own books. He has created original characters and series for comic books, and some of his more popular horror stories have been featured in ongoing comics series.
Early life.
Barker was born in Liverpool, the son of Joan Ruby (née Revill), a painter and school welfare officer, and Leonard Barker, a personnel director for an industrial relations firm. He was educated at Dovedale Primary School, Quarry Bank High School and the University of Liverpool, where he studied English and philosophy.
When he was three years old, Barker witnessed the French skydiver Léo Valentin plummet to his death during a performance at an air show in Liverpool. Barker would later allude to Valentin in many of his stories.
Theatrical work.
Barker's involvement in live theater began while still in school with productions of "Voodoo" and "Inferno" in 1967. He collaborated on six plays with "Theatre of the Imagination" in 1974 and two more that he was the sole writer of, "A Clowns' Sodom" and "Day of the Dog," for "The Mute Pantomime Theatre" in 1976 and 1977.
He co-founded the avant-garde theatrical troupe "The Dog Company" in 1978 with former school friends and up and coming actors, many of which would go on to become key collaborators in Barker's film work. Doug Bradley would take on the iconic role of Pinhead in the "Hellraiser" series while Peter Atkins would write the scripts for the first three Hellraiser sequels. Over the next five years Barker would write nine plays, often serving as director, including some of his most well-known stage productions, "The History of The Devil", "Frankenstein in Love", and "The Secret Life of Cartoons".
From 1982 to 1983, he also created three plays, including "Crazyface", for the Cockpit Youth Theatre.
His theatrical work would come to a close as he shifted focus to writing the "Books of Blood".
Writing career.
Barker is an author of horror/fantasy. He began writing horror early in his career, mostly in the form of short stories (collected in "Books of Blood" 1–6) and the Faustian novel "The Damnation Game" (1985). Later he moved toward modern-day fantasy and urban fantasy with horror elements in "Weaveworld" (1987), "The Great and Secret Show" (1989), the world-spanning "Imajica" (1991), and "Sacrament" (1996).
When "Books of Blood" were first published in the United States in paperback, Stephen King was quoted on the book covers: "I have seen the future of horror and his name is Clive Barker." As influences on his writing, Barker lists Herman Melville, Edgar Allan Poe, Ray Bradbury, William S. Burroughs, William Blake, and Jean Cocteau, among others.
He is the writer of the best-selling "Abarat" series.
Personal life.
During his early years as a writer, he would occasionally work as a male prostitute when his writing didn't provide sufficient income.
In 2003, Barker received the Davidson/Valentini Award at the 15th GLAAD Media Awards.
Barker is critical of organized religion, but has said that the Bible influences his work and spirituality. In a 2003 appearance on "Politically Incorrect", Barker stated that he was a Christian after Ann Coulter implied he was not, although years later, he said he does not identify as a Christian via Facebook.
Barker said in a December 2008 online interview (published in March 2009) that he had polyps in his throat which were so severe that a doctor told him he was taking in ten percent of the air he was supposed to have been getting. He has had two surgeries to remove them and believes his resultant voice is an improvement over how it was prior to the surgeries. He said he did not have cancer and has given up cigars.
In 2012, Barker went into coma for several days after having contracted toxic shock syndrome, triggered by a visit to the dentist which unloaded a spillage of poisonous bacteria into his bloodstream, almost claiming his life. Realizing he might have just a short time left to live, he decided to put his personal concerns about the world and society into the upcoming novel "Deep Hill", which he then thought could be his final book.
As of 2015, he is a member of the board of advisers for the Hollywood Horror Museum.
Relationships.
While appearing on the radio call-in show "Loveline" on 20 August 1996, Barker stated that during his teens he had several relationships with older women, but came to identify himself as homosexual by 18 or 19 years old. His relationship with John Gregson lasted from 1975 until 1986.
He later spent 13 years with photographer David Armstrong, described as his husband in the introduction to "Coldheart Canyon"; they separated in 2009.
Film work.
Barker wrote the screenplays for "Underworld" (1985) and "Rawhead Rex" (1986), both directed by George Pavlou. Displeased by how his material was handled, he moved to directing with "Hellraiser" (1987), based on his novella "The Hellbound Heart". After his film "Nightbreed" (1990) flopped, Barker returned to write and direct "Lord of Illusions" (1995). The short story "The Forbidden", from Barker's "Books of Blood", provided the basis for the 1992 film "Candyman" and its two sequels. He had been working on a series of film adaptations of his "The Abarat Quintet" books under The Walt Disney Company's management, but due to creative differences, the project was cancelled.
He served as an executive producer for the 1998 film "Gods and Monsters", a semi-fictional tale of "Frankenstein" director James Whale’s later years, which won an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Barker said of his interest in the project: "Whale was gay, I'm gay; Whale was English, I'm English…Whale made some horror movies, and I've made some horror movies. It seemed as if I should be helping to tell this story." Barker also provided the forward on the published shooting script.
In 2005, Barker and horror film producer Jorge Saralegui created the film production company Midnight Picture Show with the intent of producing two horror films per year.
In October 2006, Barker announced through his website that he will be writing the script to a forthcoming remake of the original "Hellraiser" film. He is developing a film based on his "Tortured Souls" line of toys from McFarlane Toys.
Television work.
In May 2015, "Variety" reported that Clive Barker was developing a television series adaptation of various creepypastas in partnership with Warner Brothers, to be called "Clive Barker's Creepypastas", a feature arc based on "Slender Man" and "Ben Drowned". Barker was involved in a streaming service film adaptation of "The Books of Blood" in 2020, and is developing a "Nightbreed" television series directed by Michael Dougherty and written by Josh Stolberg for SyFy. In April 2020, HBO was announced to be developing a "Hellraiser" television series that would serve as "an elevated continuation and expansion" of its mythology with Mark Verheiden and Michael Dougherty writing the series and David Gordon Green directing several episodes. Verheiden, Dougherty and Green will also be executive producing the series with Danny McBride, Jody Hill, Brandon James and Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment.

Barker is a prolific visual artist, often illustrating his own books. His paintings have been seen first on the covers of his official fan club magazine, "Dread", published by Fantaco in the early '90s; on the covers of the collections of his plays, "Incarnations" (1995) and "Forms of Heaven" (1996); and on the second printing of the original British publications of his "Books of Blood" series. Barker also provided the artwork for his young adult novel "The Thief of Always" and for the "Abarat" series. His artwork has been exhibited at Bert Green Fine Art in Los Angeles and Chicago, at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York and La Luz De Jesus in Los Angeles. Many of his sketches and paintings can be found in the collection "Clive Barker, Illustrator", published in 1990 by Arcane/Eclipse Books, and in "Visions of Heaven and Hell", published in 2005 by Rizzoli Books.
He worked on the horror video game "Clive Barker's Undying", providing the voice for the character Ambrose. "Undying" was developed by DreamWorks Interactive and released in 2001. He worked on "Clive Barker's Jericho" for Codemasters, which was released in late 2007.
