The Emperor Penguin ("Aptenodytes forsteri") is a penguin that lives in Antarctica. It is the tallest and heaviest penguin.
Appearance.
Emperor Penguins are about 1.15 metres / 4 ft. tall and weigh 32 kilograms / 70 to 90 lbs. Emperor Penguins are black and white like all penguins, and the sides of their neck are golden.
Life.
They eat mostly crustaceans, such as krill, but also eat fish and squid.
Emperors live in the coldest climate on earth. Temperatures can drop as low as -140 degrees Fahrenheit on the Antarctic ice. They breed at the beginning of the Antarctic winter (March and April), on the ice all around the Antarctic continent.
The shape of their body helps them to survive. They have short wings that help them to dive up to 900 feet to catch larger fish. They can swim up to 12 miles per hour for a short time, which lets them escape their main enemy, the Leopard Seal. They can stay warm because they have a thick layer of blubber. The layer of downy feathers trap air that keeps the body heat in and cold air and water out. They also have large amounts of body oil that help in keeping them dry in the water. The wings of the Emperor penguin help it swim.
