The A-10 Thunderbolt II (also called the Warthog) is an attack aircraft made by Fairchild Aircraft. It first flew in 1972 and was introduced in 1977. It is designed to drop bombs, fire rockets, missiles, and its cannon at enemies on the ground (like tanks). It is named after the World War II P-47 Thunderbolt. It is not as fast as most military jets, but it is tough and can turn well.
