The "Epic of Gilgamesh" is an epic poem from ancient Mesopotamia and is one of the earliest works of literary fiction ever known.
The most complete version that exists today was preserved on twelve clay tablets in the library collection of the 7th century BCE Assyrian king Ashurbanipal.
Scholars think that already very early a series of Sumerian legends and poems about the mythological hero-king Gilgamesh existed and that they were gathered into a longer Akkadian poem some time before the 7th century BCE.
The essential story is about the relationship between Gilgamesh, a king who has become distracted and disheartened by his rule, and a friend, Enkidu, who is half-wild and who undertakes dangerous quests with Gilgamesh. Much of the epic focuses on Gilgamesh's thoughts of loss following Enkidu's death, and is often credited by historians as being one of the first literary works with high emphasis on immortality.
The epic is widely read in translation, and the hero, Gilgamesh, has become an icon of popular culture.
History.
Gilgamesh's supposed historical reign is believed to lie within the period 2700 to 2500 BC, 200-400 years before the earliest known written stories.
Some aspects of the Gilgamesh flood myth seem to be related to the story of Noah's ark in the Bible; see deluge.
