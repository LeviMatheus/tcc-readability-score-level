Predicate logic is a system of mathematical logic. It uses predicates to express the state of certain things. It is different from other systems of logic because it has the concept of "quantifiers". This means, that it can also express things about quantity.
The best-known quantifiers are the "existence quantifier" (∃). The existence quantifier says that there is at least one (thing) that matches the predicate or formula. The other well-known quantifier is called "universal quantifier" (∀). It says that all the things match a certain predicate or formula.
