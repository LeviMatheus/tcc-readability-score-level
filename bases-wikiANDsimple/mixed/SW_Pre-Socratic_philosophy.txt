The Pre-Socratic Greek philosophers were active before Socrates. The popular usage of the term come from Hermann Diels' work "Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker" ("The Fragments of the Pre-Socratics", 1903).
Most of what we know about the pre-Socractic philosophers come from quotations by later philosophers and historians. While most of them produced significant texts, none of the texts have survived in complete form.
