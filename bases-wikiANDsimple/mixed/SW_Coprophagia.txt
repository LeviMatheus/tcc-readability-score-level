Coprophagia is the eating of faeces. Many animals eat faeces, either their own or that of other animal groups. It is particularly common in dogs and puppies of about 6mths old, but little is known why; lack of stimulus and variety in the lifestyle or diet have been cited as potential reasons and adding pineapple to their food is well recognised as overcoming the problem in many dogs. Humans do it only on rare occasions and it is looked down upon in most societies today.
