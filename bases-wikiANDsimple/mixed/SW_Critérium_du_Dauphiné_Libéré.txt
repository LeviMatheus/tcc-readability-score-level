The Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré is an annual cycling road race, run over eight stages in the Dauphiné region in France during the first half of June. It is organised by the "Le Dauphiné Libéré" newspaper. Along with the Tour de Suisse, the Dauphiné Libéré is an important race in the lead-up to the Tour de France in July.
Because the Dauphiné is a mountainous area, the winners are often climbing specialists. Many climbs that are famous from the Tour de France, like the Mont Ventoux, the Col du Galibier or "Col de la Chartreuse" appear often in the Dauphiné Libéré.
All cyclists who have won the Tour de France five times or more have also won the Dauphiné Libéré.
The first Dauphiné Libéré was held in 1947 when Eduard Klablinski from Poland was the winner. Nello Lauredi, Luis Ocaña, Charly Mottet and Bernard Hinault share the record of the most wins, with three each.
Lance Armstrong used the Dauphiné Libéré as preparation for the Tour de France. He won the Dauphiné in 2002 and 2003, but was defeated by Iban Mayo in 2004, who climbed Mont Ventoux very quickly. Armstrong finished 4th in the 2005 Dauphiné, finishing 59 seconds "off the pace of" (that is "slower than" or "behind") overall winner Iñigo Landaluze, of the Euskaltel-Euskadi team.
