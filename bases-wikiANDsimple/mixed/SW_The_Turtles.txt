The Turtles were a 1960s pop group from Los Angeles, California. Their best known song is "Happy Together". Chip Douglas was a band member, who left to produce the Monkees, then returned as the Turtles producer. After the Turtles broke up in the 1970s, the group's two frontmen, Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, sang with Frank Zappa as Flo and Eddie.
