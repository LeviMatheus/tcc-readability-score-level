This is a list of numbered minor planets, nearly all of them asteroids, in sequential order.
As of December 2008 there are 202,885 numbered minor planets, and many more not yet numbered. Three minor planets have also been classified as dwarf planets. But most asteroids are ordinary and not particularly noteworthyâ€”less than 15,000 of them have been named (the first nameless asteroid having number 3708). For a smaller list of notable asteroids, see List of notable asteroids.
