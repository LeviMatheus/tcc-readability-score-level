The prostate is a gland of the male body that adds part of the fluid to semen, and stops males from urinating while sexually aroused. A healthy human prostate is slightly larger than a walnut. It surrounds the urethra just below the urinary bladder.
Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting elderly men in developed (also known as first world) countries and a major cause of death. Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early.
The prostate is often referred to as the male g-spot. When starting out, it is best to use a well lubricated finger or insert a small dildo into the anus. Once you have inserted a finger to approximately the second knuckle, make a "come hither" motion (similar to that of the motion one makes when attempting to stimulate the female g-spot). While this may feel strange or uncomfortable at first, when done correctly, it can often lead to intense pleasure for the male. Some males are able to orgasm with g-spot stimulation alone.
