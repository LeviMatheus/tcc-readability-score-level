The foreskin is a fold of skin that covers the glands penis. The foreskin protects the glands penis when the penis is not erect. Most mammals have foreskin.
Human foreskin.
The outside of the foreskin is like normal skin but the inside of the foreskin is a membrane like the inside of an eyelid or mouth. The foreskin is attached to the penis by the frenulum, but it can move. Muscles made it very stretchy. The five most sensitive areas of the penis are on the foreskin.
Use.
The World Health Organization say that there are lots of uses for the foreskin, such as keeping the glans penis moist, protecting it or to make sexual intercourse feel nicer since it has so many nerves in it.
However, Moses and Bailey (1998), say that "it has not been demonstrated that [the foreskin] is associated with increased male sexual pleasure."
Circumcision.
"Circumcision" is when the foreskin is cut off. It may be done for religious, health, beauty reasons or to stop disease.
The foreskin can also be pierced or slit for fashion reasons.
