The term "Hebrew Bible" means books of the Bible that were originally written in Hebrew, and of which people agree that they belong to the Biblical canon.
It means nearly the same as the Jewish Tanakh and the Protestant Old Testament, but does not include the deuterocanonical portions of the Roman Catholic Old Testament and is meant for the text only, not for naming, numbering or ordering of books (what both Tanakh and Old Testament do).
"Hebrew Bible" is a term that refers to the common portions of the Jewish canon and the Christian canons. In its Latin form, "Biblia Hebraica", it is used as a title for printed editions of the masoretic text.
Usage.
One uses the term "Hebrew Bible", when one wants to speak of the contents and not of the specific Jewish or Protestant edition of it.
On the one hand, the term is not much used among adherents of either Judaism or Christianity. On the other hand, it is widely used in academic writing and interfaith discussion.
