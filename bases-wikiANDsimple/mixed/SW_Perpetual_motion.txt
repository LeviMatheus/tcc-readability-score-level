The term perpetual motion refers to a movement that goes on forever. More specifically, the term refers to a closed system (or a machine) that produces more energy than it consumes. Such a device or system would be against the law of conservation of energy, which states that energy can never be created or destroyed. The most conventional type of perpetual motion machine is a mechanical system which (supposedly) sustains motion despite losing energy to friction and air resistance, or while avoiding losing energy to friction and air resistance. According to the law of conservation of energy, such a device cannot exist.
