Joseph Byrne also known as Joe Byrne (November 1857 - June 28 1880) was an Australian bushranger. He is known as the lieutenant of the Kelly Gang. He died in the siege of Glenrowan. Joe Byrne was an excellent shot, a good horseman and a skilled bushman. This made it difficult for the police to capture him. His skill at writing helped him to write the items that were important in starting the Kelly legend. He wrote the famous Jerilderie letter. There is also a legend that Ned Kelly, with Byrne's help, was going to start an independent republic in north-eastern Victoria. The siege at Glenrowan was the first step.
