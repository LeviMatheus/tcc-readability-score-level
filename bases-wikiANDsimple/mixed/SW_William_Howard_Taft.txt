William Howard Taft (September 15, 1857 â€“ March 8, 1930) was the 27th President of the United States from March 4, 1909 to March 3, 1913. He is well-known for being the heaviest President in U.S. history, weighing over 350 pounds.
Taft served as Solicitor General of the United States, a federal judge, Governor-General of the Philippines, and Secretary of War before being nominated for President in the 1908 by the man who preceded him, Theodore Roosevelt. As a Republican President, Taft was most notable for trust-busting, in which he broke up large businesses that had too much control over the economy. Taft also expanded civil service, fixed up the United States Postal Service and promoted world peace.
In 1912, Theodore Roosevelt came back into politics and ran for President against William Howard Taft. Many Republicans split their votes between Taft and Roosevelt, and the Democratic opponent Woodrow Wilson won the election.
In 1921, Taft became the 10th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. He retired from the job on February 3, 1930 due to bad health. Taft died on March 8, 1930 due to heart failure. Three days later, he became the first president to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
