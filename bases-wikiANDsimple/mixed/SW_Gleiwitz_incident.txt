The Gleiwitz incident was a planned German attack against the radio station "Sender Gleiwitz" in the German town of Gliwice on the night of August 31, 1939. This attack along with other Nazi activities was used to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany and justify the subsequent invasion that started World War II.
