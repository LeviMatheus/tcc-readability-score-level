Firhill Stadium is the home ground of the Scottish association football club, Partick Thistle F.C.
In December 2005 Firhill also became the temporary home of Glasgow's professional Rugby Union team, Glasgow Warriors, when they moved from their previous base at Hughenden. The Glasgow Warriors will take up a two-year residency at Firhill from the start of the 2007-08 Magners League season.
