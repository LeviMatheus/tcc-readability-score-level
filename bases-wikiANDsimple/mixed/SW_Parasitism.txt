Parasitism is a form of symbiosis. It means that a parasite is any organism or living thing that benefits from another creature's harm. In other words, the parasites harm the host organism while the parasite benefits. A parasitic relationship is the opposite of a mutualistic relationship. Examples of parasites in humans include tapeworms and leeches.
