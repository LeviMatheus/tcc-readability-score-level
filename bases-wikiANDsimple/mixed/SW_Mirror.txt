A mirror is something that reflects light. One common "plane mirror" is a piece of special flat glass that a person can look into in order to see themselves or what is behind them.
Sometimes, a flat piece of metal or the surface of water can act like a mirror.
The reason you are able to see yourself in a mirror is because light comes in and gets reflected, and that's how you're able to see your reflection. Mirrors can have magnification properties, making images appear smaller or larger than their actual size. They can also be concave or convex, making the reflected angle smaller or larger, respectively.
Special mirrors in a museum are good to check out. Some make you look quite strange. Also, in a mirror, writing appears backwards.
Mirrors are usually made out of sand, like glass is.
