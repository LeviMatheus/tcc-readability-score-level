Below is a list of animated movies from Walt Disney Pictures/The Walt Disney Company. For a list of live-action movies from the company, see List of Disney movies.
Official canon (Walt Disney Animated Classics).
The following is a list of the forty-nine feature films part of the Walt Disney Feature Animation (WDFA) canon, also known as the Walt Disney Animated Classics. The canon includes animated features that were or are being produced entirely by WDFA. Not included are animation/live-action combination movies, spin-offs from Disney television shows, the direct-to-video movies produced by the DisneyToons studio in Australia (some of which received theatrical releases), or the Pixar movies (which Disney "presents" but does not produce). WDFA once announced that "Home on the Range" (released April 2 2004) would be its final traditionally animated movie, and from "Chicken Little" (released November 4 2005) onwards, all future WDFA films will be computer animated. However, this changed in July 2006 when a new traditionally animated movie, "The Frog Princess", was revealed to be in development.
Live-action movies with animation.
These movies use Live-action with animation and are not considered a part of the offical canon.
Theatrical movies.
To date, all theatrical animated movies created by DisneyToon Studios are traditionally (2-D) animated.
