Markbygden Wind Farm will be a series of interconnected wind farms in the Markbygden area of northern Sweden, covering some 450 square kilometres. The project will be built between now and 2020, and will have a capacity of up to 4 GW. Enercon has a share in the project and will build a wind tower production plant in the region, as well as a local office for service and maintenance.
