Count Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta (18 February 1745 â€“ 5 March 1827) was a Lombard physicist known especially for the development of the first electrical cell in 1800. He was born in Como in Lombardy, Italy.
Volta worked on the that makes a static electric charge in 1775. Volta also studied what we now call capacitance, developing separate means to study both electrical potential V and charge Q, and discovering that for a given object they are proportional. This may be called Volta's Law of, and likely for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the volt. Around 1791 he began to study ". In this way he discovered Volta's Law of the series, and the law that the (emf formula_1) of a. In 1800, He invented the "voltaic pile", an early electric battery, which made a steady electric current. It is credited as the first electrochemical cell.
In honor of his work in the field of electricity, Napoleon made him a count in 1810. A museum in Como, the Voltian Temple, has been built in his honor and exhibits some of the original equipment he used to conduct experiments. In 1881, an important electrical unit, the volt(V), was named in his honor. There have also been innovations and discoveries named after Alessandro Volta including the, and the on the Moon.
Volta married the daughter of Count Ludovico Peregrini, Teresa, with whom he raised three sons. In 1779 he became professor of experimental physics at the University of, a chair he occupied for almost 25 years. Volta is buried in the city of Como. At the Tempio Voltiano near there is a museum devoted to explaining his work.
