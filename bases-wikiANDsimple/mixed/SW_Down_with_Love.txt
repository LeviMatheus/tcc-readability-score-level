Plot.
Catcher Block (McGregor) is a very proud man. He gets a lot of women and he does not respect them very much. When the author Barbara Novak gets an interview with Block about her newest book, he keeps being busy and never actually interviews with her. Novak has written a feminist novel in which she says that women should take more power and have a bigger voice in things and to eat chocolate to reduce their need to be with men. However, when Novak's book becomes very popular, Block wants to know more about Novak.
Block invents a name for himself and begins to go out with her. She falls for him despite what she wrote in her book. She is about to take things further with Block when a woman rushes in to tell her that she loved Novak's book. It is then that Novak realizes that she has created a movement and that she needs to be the leader of that movement, so she no longer wants to see Block.
Block tries to reinvent himself as a new person. He writes an expose on himself and wants to have it published, but all the women that used to work at his "No" magazine have all quit to try to get jobs at Novak's new "Now" magazine. Block applies for a job there and tells her that he loves her. After a short conversation, they leave in a helicopter to go to Las Vegas to get married.
