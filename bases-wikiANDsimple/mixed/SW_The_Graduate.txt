"The Graduate" is a 1967 movie based on a novel by Charles Webb, and directed by Mike Nichols.
In the movie and book, a recent college graduate (played by Dustin Hoffman) is seduced by Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and falls in love with her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross).
The movie was Hoffman's first major role (he had appeared before in just another one). He was nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts.
The soundtrack album contained music by folk duo Simon and Garfunkel, and beat out the Beatles' "White Album" for the number one position on the music charts.
Scenes from "The Graduate" have been largely remembered by many people. In one of them, one-word advice for corporate success ("Plastics") is given by a family friend of Benjamin's. (Reportedly, sales of stock in plastics companies jumped in the months after the movie appeared.) Another scene, where Ben tries to stop Elaine from marrying another man, has been imitated and parodied in television programs, including the cartoon series "Daria".
In 1998, a play based on the movie premiered in London and on Broadway; its stars included Kathleen Turner, Alicia Silverstone and Morgan Fairchild.
