Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (or Virginia Tech) is a public university in Blacksburg, Virginia. The campus was first opened in 1872 as a farming and mechanical college and covers 2,600 acres. It is also one of only a few public universities in the United States to have a corps of cadets.
The Virginia Tech massacre, which happened on the 16th of April 2007, is a milestone in the history of the University. A student of the university named Cho Seung-Hui killed 32 people before killing himself. This became the worst school-related massacre in United States history.
