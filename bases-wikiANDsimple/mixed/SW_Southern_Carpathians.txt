The Southern Carpathians (Romanian: Carpaţii Meridionali), also called the Transylvanian Alps, are a group of mountainranges. They divide central and southern Romania, on one side, and Serbia, on the other side. They cover part of the Carpathian Mountains that is located between the Prahova River in the east and the Timiş and Cerna Rivers in the west. To the south they are bounded by the Balkan mountain range of Serbia.
