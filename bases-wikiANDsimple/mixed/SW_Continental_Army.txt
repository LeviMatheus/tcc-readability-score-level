The Continental Army was the fighting force of the thirteen British colonies in the American Revolutionary War. It was created in 1775 by the First Continental Congress. Most of the army was disbanded in 1783 after the conclusion of the war. The army was officially closed by a resolution of Congress in 1784. The United States Army replaced it.
George Washington was elected the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army when it was formed and served until its replacement.
