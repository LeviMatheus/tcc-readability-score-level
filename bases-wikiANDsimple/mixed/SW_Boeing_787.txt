The Boeing 787 (also called the Dreamliner) is an aircraft made by Boeing. It has not flown yet, but its first flight should be near the end of the year 2008 and will start being used by airlines in the year 2009. These dates have been changed lots of times and now some airlines will get their aircraft nearly 30 months late.
