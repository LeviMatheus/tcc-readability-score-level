Logarithms or logs are a part of mathematics. They are related to exponential functions, and useful in multiplying or dividing large numbers.
Relationship with exponential functions.
A logarithm tells what exponent (or power) is needed to make a certain number, so logarithms are the inverse (opposite) of exponentiation
Just as an exponential function has three parts, a logarithm has three parts. The three parts of a logarithm are a base, an argument and an answer.
In this function, the power is 3, the answer is 8.
In this logarithm, the base is 2, the argument is 8 and the answer is 3.
Uses.
Logarithms can make multiplication and division of large numbers easy because adding logarithms is the same as multiplying, and subtracting logarithms is the same as dividing.
Before calculators became cheap and common, people used logarithm tables in books to multiply and divide. The same information in a logarithm table was available on a slide rule, a tool with logarithms written on it.
Natural logarithms.
Logarithms to base "e" are called natural logarithms. The number e is nearly 2.71828, and is also called the Eulerian constant after the mathematician Leonhard Euler.
