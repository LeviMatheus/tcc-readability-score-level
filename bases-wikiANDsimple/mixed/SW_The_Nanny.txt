Story.
The series is about a woman named Fran Fine who gets fired from her job and decides to do her job (selling perfume) on her own. She knocks on a door and a man named Niles opens the door and thinks Fran is the nanny. Niles calls Maxwell Sheffield (the person he works for since he's a butler) and says that the nanny has arrived. Maxwell wants to see her resume so she writes one with lipstick and then she becomes the nanny. In one episode, Fran and Maxwell end up getting married.
