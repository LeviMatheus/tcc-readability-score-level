Turquoise is the color of the gem turquoise. It is a slightly greenish shade of cyan. Turquoise is sometimes described as a mixture of pale blue and green. The name comes from the French for Turkish.
People who practise holistic medicine say that turquoise has a calming effect on patients. They use this color to treat patients prone to panic attacks or mania. To a lesser degree, mainstream psychiatric hospitals also use turquoise and other light shades of blue and green to calm patients by painting the walls in these colors.
"The Turquoise" is slang for the waters of the Caribbean. In the sunlight these waters look turquoise because they are shallow.
The color and gem stone represent December.
