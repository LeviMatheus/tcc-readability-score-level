Since 1949 (except 1990-1996), Slovakia has been divided into a number of "kraje" (singular "kraj", usually translated as Regions, but mean rather county). Slovakia is currently divided into 8 regions. Each kraj is then divided into many "okresy" (singular "okres", usually translated as districts). Slovakia currently has 79 districts.
Each region is named after its capital.
The following list shows: name of the region, its capital, number of districts, population (as of 2001) and area.
