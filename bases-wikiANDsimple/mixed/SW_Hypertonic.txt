A solution is hypertonic when there are more solutes outside of a cell than inside. Over time the cell will lose water through the passive process of osmosis (i.e from a high concentration to a low concentration of water molecules). When a cell is placed in a hypertonic solution, the water diffuses (moves) out of the cell, causing the cell to shrivel. An example of a hypertonic solution is saltwater.
