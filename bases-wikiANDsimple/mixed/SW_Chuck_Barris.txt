Chuck Barris (born Charles Hirsch Barris on June 3, 1929) is an American, best known as the creator of many popular television game shows. Some of his most famous shows were "The Dating Game", "The Newlywed Game" and "The Gong Show". These shows appeared on American television from the mid-1960s until the early 1980s.
Early in his career, Barris tried songwriting. One of his songs, "Palisades Park", was a hit record for Freddy Cannon, a popular singer.
After "The Gong Show" went off the air, Barris kept a lower profile, but still worked in television. In the 1980s, he published a memoir, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind". Barris claimed in the book to have been a CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) agent and assassin, who regretted his earlier life. He also regretted making "puerile" television shows, that catered to poor taste. It was republished in the 1990s.
Many people believe "Confessions" does not tell a true story. Others are not sure if it is fact or fiction. Some, including celebrities who knew Barris, do not know or care, and enjoy his stories as entertainment. The CIA itself denies Barris ever worked for them.
George Clooney made "Confessions" into a movie, starring Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts.
