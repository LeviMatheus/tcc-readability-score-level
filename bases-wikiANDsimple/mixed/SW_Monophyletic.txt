Biologists have introduced a taxonomy. If there is a group, that is made of a common ancestor (or parent), and all its descendants (children), they call that group monophyletic (Greek: "of one race"). A group that contains organisms, but does not include their common ancestor, is called polyphyletic. If a goup contains the common ancestor, but leaves out some of its descendants, it is called paraphyletic.
For example, all organisms in the genus "Homo" are inferred to have come from the same ancestral form in the family Hominidae, and no other descendants are known. Thus the genus "Homo" is monophyletic. If, on the other hand, it were discovered that "Homo habilis" had developed from a different ancestor than "Homo sapiens", and this ancestor were not included in the genus, then the genus would be polyphyletic. Since biologists by and large tend to accept groups when they are monophyletic, in this case, they would likely either split the genus or broaden it to include the additional forms. Splitting the genus may split explanations of functional evolution to require convergence.
Some evolutionary taxonomists prefer to use the term holophyletic to describe this sort of group and instead use monophyletic in its older sense, where it refers to both holophyletic and paraphyletic groups.
Sometimes taxonomists are frustrated fitting plant species into a monophyletic group because of polyploidy. There is evidence that some polyploid plant species are of multiple origins (the species has arisen more than once). For example hybrid goat's-beard ("Tragopogon miscellus") has formed as many as 20 times in eastern Washington. Unity of explanation through functional evolution is challenged by the atomization required by strict monophyly.
