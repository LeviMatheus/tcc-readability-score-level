In Norse mythology, Ragnarök ("fate of the gods") is the battle at the end of the world. It would be fought between the gods or Æsir, led by Odin and the fire giants, the Jötnar and other monsters, led by Loki. Not only will some of the gods, giants, and monsters die in this battle, but almost everything in the universe will be destroyed.
Surtr then used his sword to cover the worlds in flame. But he also died in the fire.
Freyja kills herself after she sees Freyr die.
None of the goddesses were mentioned, but we assume that Frigg would survive.
