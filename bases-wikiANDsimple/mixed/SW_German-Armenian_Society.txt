The German-Armenian Society was founded in Berlin in 1914. Apart from Johannes Lepsius, its original members included the journalist Paul Rohrbach and the Armenian author Avetik Issahakyan.
The goals of DAG are the promotion and understanding between Germans and Armenians and to safeguard the likings of Armenians living in Germany. Furthermore, the DAG defends the rights and interests of Armenian minorities, including in Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries.
