"The Artist in the Ambulance" is the third album by the post-hardcore band Thrice. It was released on July 22 2003.
Like previous Thrice albums, some of the money made from selling "The Artist in the Ambulance" was given to a charity. The album's booklet features individual cards that have lyrics from Thrice songs, notes, photographs and comments from the band members and the producer.
"Stare at the Sun" is a main single from the album.
