Expressionism is a kind of art. In the true meaning of the word, it is an art movement of the 20th century.
Expressionist artists try to express a feeling with what they create. Colours and shapes are often not used in a way people see them, but as they could "feel" them. Influences on modern expressionism were painters like El Greco and Matthias Gr√ºnewald.
Typical modern expressionists are August Macke, Ernst-Ludwig Kirchner, Emil Nolde and others. The first World War, with its many young men who died, left deep impressions on the artists' minds.
