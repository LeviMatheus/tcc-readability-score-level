Carnosauria are infraclass very name evokes danger, from Greek for "meat-eating lizards". These theropod dinosaurs must have terrorized their dinosaurian prey during their peak in the Jurassic period. Carnosaurs are characterized by several features, mostly modifications of the pelvis and hind legs (possibly adaptations evolved along with their increased size). For example, the carnosaurian femur ("thigh bone") is usually larger than the tibia ("shin bone"). Also characteristic of the Carnosauria are large orbits (eye openings in the skull) and a generally long, narrow skull.
