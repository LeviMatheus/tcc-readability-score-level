"Most Haunted" is a British television programme based on a group of paranormal investigators (people who investigate things) going and doing paranormal investigations of places. The following is a list of episodes and locations for the series since it began in 2002.
Series 1 (2002).
Note: Most of these episodes were only 30 minutes long, however, some have been made the full hour and titled 'Most Haunted Unseen'. Footage added has a note that says that it is not part of the original broadcast. The first episode to be produced, and the last to appear in the series was "Michelham Priory". In Series 8, the team revisited this location to mark the 100th episode.
Series 4 (2004).
Note: Phil Whyman left at the end of the 4th Series.
Series 6 (2005).
Note: David Wells became a medium on this show in this series alongside the long-time favorite, Derek Acorah. This was the last series that Derek Acorah would be the medium in and he didn't appear in the final episode at Sinai House. The original run for Series 6 was only to be 18 episodes, with the last 11 as Series 7, but due to the leaving of Acorah, the series was made longer.
Series 8 (2006).
Note: The last 3 episodes were meant to be from Series 7, but were made part of the eighth series. They are known as the "lost episodes" and had more guest showings from Medium Gordon Smith. Also appearing were Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito and Kevin Wade. Richard Felix departed the programme after Series 8 because their producers dropped his role from the show.
Series 9 (2007).
Note: The series became known as New Most Haunted after Episode 4 in the television listings on screen, with the word 'New' covering the corner of the logo for the show.
