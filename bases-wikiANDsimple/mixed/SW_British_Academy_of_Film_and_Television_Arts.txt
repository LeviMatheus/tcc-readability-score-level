The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) is a British organisation that gives awards at a special show every year, for film, television, children's film and television, and media.
BAFTA was created in 1947 as The British Film Academy. In 1958, the Academy joined with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors and together they formed The Society of Film and Television, which later became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.
BAFTA's main office is on Piccadilly in London, but it also has smaller offices in Northern England, Scotland, Wales, New York City and Los Angeles.
The Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, which was ordered by the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.
