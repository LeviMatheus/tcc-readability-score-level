A frog is a amphibian animal. They are the order "Anura".
Frogs live on land and in fresh water. Frogs cannot survive in salt water. Frogs hatch as tadpoles (the name for baby frogs) from eggs from a female frog. The eggs are called spawn. Tadpoles have fins and gills. When they grow up, they lose their tails and gills and have four long legs. Grown frogs can jump far with their legs. They have long tongues that they use to catch bugs. They make a sound called a croak. They sometimes live in trees and sometimes have poison. Frogs live all over the world. Different types of frogs are native to different countries and have different characteristics that relate to the environment of this country. If an overseas species of frogs is introduced to another country, the ecosystem can be hugely affected.
Frog legs are occasionally eaten as food in France, China, and the Midwest of the United States.
