Plesiosaurus was a prehistoric marine animal. It was an omnivore, an animal that ate both meat and plants. Plesiosaurs lived mostly on fish. It would swim through schools of fish and use its long neck and sharp teeth to snap from side to side.
A Plesiosaurus was about 4.5 meters long. It had a flat body and limbs like paddles. It used these limbs to swim backward or forward. People think that the Loch Ness monster is a plesiosarus.
