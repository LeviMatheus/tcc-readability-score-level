The Printing press is a machine. It is used to make many copies of identical pages. The printing press today is used to print Books and Newspapers. Today (2006) everything is done automatically. When the printing press was invented by Johannes Gutenberg, he had to put letters together. Each letter was in a block of metal, that was fixed in a frame. He could then move paper and ink over it, much like a stamp. The letters would leave some ink on the paper.
