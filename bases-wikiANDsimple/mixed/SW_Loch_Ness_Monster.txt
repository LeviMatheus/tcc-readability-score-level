The Loch Ness Monster, sometimes called Nessie, is a mysterious and unidentified animal, that is said to inhabit the Scottish loch of Loch Ness, the second biggest lake in the country. The Loch Ness Monster has been a mystery for centuries, and is considered a major subject in the field of cryptozoology.
Most scientists believe that the Loch Ness Monster is not real, and treat many sightings as either hoaxes or mistaken identities of other animals. However, a popular theory among believers is that "Nessie" is a plesiosaur, an extinct meat-eating water reptile that existed during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. The Loch Ness monster has also been described as an elephant, eel, and other pre-historic creatures.
