Nyngan is a town 160 kilometres north West of, and 190 kilometres South east of Bourke in the Central West Plains of New South Wales in Australia. It is a town of 2500 people. It exists because of the people who work on the farms and in a copper mine, 50 kilometres to the West.
It remains also well known as one of the last depots of Cobb and Co, the famous inland transporter of the 19th century (1801 to 1900). One of the overnight depots was at Nyngan because it is about half way between Dubbo and Bourke. In the days of Cobb and Co, the trip from Dubbo and Bourke would have taken at least 4 days.
However, the route they took is not the route that is used today. The new route runs beside the railway. The railway is a direct line from Dubbo to Nyngan. There is not a single bend for almost 160 kilometres. In the other direction, the track goes 190 kilometres dead straight the whole way to Bourke.
