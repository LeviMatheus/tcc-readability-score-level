Deal or No Deal is a game show in more than 40 countries on the world created by John de Mol.
Format.
"Deal or No Deal" involves a contestant, a host/presenter, a banker, and a number of briefcases (or boxes), with each having a different (and initially unknown) value. Each game starts with the contestant selecting one of the cases—this first case's value is not known until the game ends. During the rest of the game, the contestant opens the rest of the cases, one at a time, revealing its value. Each time after a specified number of cases are opened, the banker offers the contestant a certain amount of money to end the game. If the contestant takes an offer, the game ends, otherwise the contestant ends up with the money from the first case.
Since the range of possible values for cases is known at the start of each game, how much the banker offers at any given point changes based on what cases have been eliminated. To promote suspense and lengthen games, the banker's offer usually strays from the expected value dictated by probability theory, particularly early in the game. However it is not uncommon for the bank's offer to exceed the player's expected value very late in the game.
Worldwide, the largest amount offer (in terms of exchange rates) was €1,495,000 on the original "Miljoenenjacht", on November 13, 2005 (which was accepted, the contestant's case only had €1,000). Only a few people have ever won the top prize on any version of the show.
