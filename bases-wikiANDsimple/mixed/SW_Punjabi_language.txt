Punjabi is a language. It is mainly spoken in the state of Punjab, both India and Pakistan. Punjabi is also spoken in the neighbouring states of Haryana, Himachal Pardesh and New Delhi in India. Punjabi developed from the ancient language of Sanskrit just like many other modern northern Indian Languages like Hindi. Punjabi is spoken by as many as 100 million people, meaning that it is one of the top ten languages in the world by number of speakers.
Punjabi is written in two different scripts, called Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi. They are both very different from the English words you are reading. The word Punjabi looks like ਪੰਜਾਬੀ in Gurmukhi and پنجابی in Shahmukhi.
