"Pogrom" (from Russian:"погром" (pogrom); from "громить" IPA: - to wreak havoc, to demolish violently) is a form of riot. This riot is directed against a group of people.
These groups may be certain ethnic groups, they may belong to a certain religion, or they may have other marks of distinction.
In a pogrom their homes, businesses, and places of worship are destroyed. Very often people of the target group are murdered.
