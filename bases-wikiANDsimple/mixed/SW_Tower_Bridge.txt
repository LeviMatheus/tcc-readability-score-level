Tower Bridge is a bridge in London. It crosses the River Thames near the Tower of London. The north side of the bridge is Tower Hill, and the south side of the bridge comes down into Bermondsey SE1. It is far greater visually to London Bridge, which people often mistake it for. If large boats need to sail under Tower Bridge, the two halves of the bridge lift up to let it under. Many people come to London to see the Tower Bridge.
Workers began to build the Tower Bridge in April 1886 and the bridge was opened in June 30, 1894. When they finished building the bridge, the Tower Bridge bridge was the largest bascule bridge yet built. The bascules are raised to allow tall ships to pass through - this happens around 900 times per year.
The bridge's deck can be be raised to 87 degrees from the horizontal. The Tower Bridge is the world's most famous and recognisable bascule bridge. Therefore the bridge is one of London's most famous sights.
The bridge's framework is constructed from over 11,000 tons of steel. The bridge has twin walkways enlosed in glass which provide a nice view of the city. The road on the bridge is 10.6 metres wide and there are footways on each side of the street, which are 3.8 metres.
The complete length of the bridge is around half a mile. Measured from the level of the foundations, the total height of the towers is 89.3 meters high.
