Dogri (ڈوگرى) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by about two million people in Indian-controlled Kashmir region and Pakistan, chiefly in the Jammu region of Indian Occupied Kashmir, but also in northern Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, other parts of Occupied Kashmir, and elsewhere. Dogri speakers are called Dogras, and the Dogri-speaking region is called Duggar. Dogri is a member of the Western Pahari Group of languages. The language is referred to as Pahari (पहाड़ी or پھاڑی) in Pakistan and Pakistani-Administered Kashmir. Unusually for an Indo-European language, Dogri is tonal, a trait it shares with other Western Pahari languages and Punjabi.
