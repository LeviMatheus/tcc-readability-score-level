Comet Halley, or Halley's Comet, is a comet. It comes close to the Earth every 75 or 76 years. It will return in 2061. It is the first comet that humans were able to predict would return.
Comet Halley is named after Edmond Halley (1656 - 1742), an English physicist, who predicted the comet's return.
When the comet came close to the Earth in 1986, it was visited by several space-probes. The probe "Giotto" from the European Space Agency managed the closest approach to the comet.
