Stellar evolution is the study of how a star changes over time. Stars can change very much between when they are first created and when they run out of energy. Because stars can put out light and heat for millions or billions of years, scientists study stellar evolution by studying many different stars in different stages of their life.
The stages in a star's life are the nebula, star, red giant and white dwarf.
How a star is born.
A star starts its life as a cloud of dust and gas called a nebula. As the cloud starts to spin, it starts to look like a ball and shines brightly, then it turns into a star.
How a star dies.
When a star starts to run out of fuel to burn, it swells up and turns into a colder star called a red giant. It can swallow up any planets around it.
Later, the red giant explodes, a cloud of gas is given off and a little ball called a white dwarf is left behind. After some time, the white dwarf cools down into a brown dwarf.
