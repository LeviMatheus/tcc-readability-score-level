The Qinling Mountains (Traditional Chinese: 秦嶺, Simplified Chinese: 秦岭) are a major mountain range. Most of them are in the Eastern province of Shaanxi, in China. The mountains provide a natural boundary between the North and South of the country. They support a large variety of plants and wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else on Earth.
