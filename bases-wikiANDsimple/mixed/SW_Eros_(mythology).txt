Eros is the god of love, lust, and sex in Greek mythology.
According to Hesiod's "Theogony", Eros came from the Chaos. Later it was said that he was the son of Ares and Aphrodite.
His lover is Psyche.
Eros has a bow and golden arrows with whom he can shoot at people so they will fall in love, but he has also leaden arrows which make people hate.
There is a famous statue to Eros in London in Piccadilly Circus.
From the name Eros we get the word erotic, meaning: to do with sexual love (passionate and physical). There is also a noun: eroticism.
