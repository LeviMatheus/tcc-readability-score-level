Ammit was the Egyptian idea of the punishment of the soul. Ammit was believed to eat any souls found to have sin. They would them be digested for eternity in acid. Or, Ammit who was believed to be the guardian of a lake of fire, would place the soul into the liquid fire for all eternity.
Ammit was a mix of the crocodile, lion, and hippo. Some of the most feared animals in Egypt at the time.
Rather than being worshiped Ammit was feared, she was not viewed as a god. Although she was viewed as a good force because she destroyed the evil.
Although Ammit is seen as a devouring entity, she is neutral and strictly serves at the whim of the other deities to take souls that have sinned against the gods and consign them into oblivion.
