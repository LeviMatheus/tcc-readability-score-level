Every Little Thing is a Japanese rock band. The group is made up of a woman and a man. The woman, Kaori Mochida, is a singer from Tokyo, and the man, Ichiro Ito, is a guitarist from Kanagawa. This group made their debut in 1996. And next year they took part in Kohaku (New Year's) Song battle for the first time. When they started the band, there were three members. But Mitsuru Igarashi left the band in 2000, and he started to focus on his production. He made all of Every Little Thing's songs and wrote their lyrics. So since he left, Every little thing sound changed a little. Now they released 35 single CDs, 8 original albums, 2 best albums and 3 ballad best albums.
