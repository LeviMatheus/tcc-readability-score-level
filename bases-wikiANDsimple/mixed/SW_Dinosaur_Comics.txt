Dinosaur Comics is a comic by Ryan North. It shows dinosaurs who have adventures and talk about philosophy. They do not always talk about philosophy though. Sometimes they talk about dogs, or about sex, or sometimes even about feelings! The art is the same every day, but the words are different. This comic is intended to be funny.
