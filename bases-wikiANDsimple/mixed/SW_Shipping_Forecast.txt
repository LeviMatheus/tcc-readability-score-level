The Shipping Forecast is an iconic part of BBC Radio 4. It is broadcast four times each day, and is issued by the Met Office, the UK meteorological centre, on behalf of the Coastguard It is a weather forecast of the seas around the United Kingdom. The forecast is separated into several areas. It which starts with "Viking" in the northeast (see image) and goes clockwise until it reaches "Southeast Iceland" in the northwest.
Protocol.
There is a strict protocol on how the forecast is laid out, and it has a limit of 370 words. The language of the forecast is hard to understand unless the listener know what to look out for. One line of the forecast commonly would be "Dover, Wight, Portland, Plymouth, four or five, increasing six soon, rain or slight drizzle, good". People listening to the forecast who know the protocol can easily understand it as "In the English Channel, there are strong winds, followed by a stronger wind in less than twelve hours time with some light rain, but good visibility". The numbers refer to the Beaufort Scale of wind strength. "Imminent" means within 6 hours, "soon" between 6 and 12, and "later" meaning after 12 hours.
Navtex.
An updated Shipping Forecast is broadcast six times a day from three Navtex transmitters situated strategically around the coast of the United Kingdom, giving information on the areas near to the transmitter. The three transmitters are called Cullercoats, Niton and Portpatrick, after the places they are at. Navtex is a type of radio communication that sends a message to a receiver that picks it up and converts it into text, similar to a mobiles' text message.
High Seas Forecast.
There is also a High Seas Forecast that can be found on Radio 4's website, which is similar to the Shipping Forecast in format and protocol, but is about the North Atlantic ocean, or 'Met Area 1'.
