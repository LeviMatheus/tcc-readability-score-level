Tainan City (Chinese: 台南市; Hanyu Pinyin: Táinán, Wade-Giles: T'ai-nan; POJ: Tâi-lâm) is a city in Taiwan and is the fourth largest city after Taipei, Kaohsiung and Taichung.
Tainan was the capital of Taiwan in 1661 by Koxinga after he took over the island from Dutch colonial rule. In 1684, the Qing Dynasty conquered Taiwan and created "Taiwan Fu" (Taiwan Government) as the first local government in Taiwan. This was later renamed to "Tainan Fu" in 1885 when Taiwan was a province. Because it was formerly the capital of Taiwan, Tainan is also called Fu-cheng (Government City). Tainan was also the capital of the Republic of Formosa.
Tainan is one of the oldest cities in Taiwan, with the Dutch port at An-ping (安平) in 1624. It is also one of Taiwan's cultural capitals, as it built the First Temple on the island, the remains of the Northern and Southern gates of the old city, and countless other historical monuments. The 2005 and 2006 Taiwan Lantern Festivals were also held in Tainan.
Tainan is known as the city with the most Buddhist and/or Taoist temples on the island of Taiwan. Tainan City is surrounded by Tainan County to the north and east and the South China Sea to the west and south.
Districts.
Tainan City now has 6 districts: Anping, Annan, East, West Central, South, and North districts.
Annan district was originally the An-Shun township of Tainan County, and was added into Tainan City in 1946. In 2004, Central District and West District became the new West Central district.
