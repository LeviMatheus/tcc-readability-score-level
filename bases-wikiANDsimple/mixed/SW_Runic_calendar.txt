The Runic calendar also "Rune staff" or "Runic Almanac" is a perpetual calendar based on the 19 year long Metonic cycle of the Moon.
A typical Runic calendar consisted of several horizontal lines of symbols, one above the other.
Special days like solstices, equinoxes, and celebrations (including Christian holidays and feasts) were marked with additional lines of symbols.
