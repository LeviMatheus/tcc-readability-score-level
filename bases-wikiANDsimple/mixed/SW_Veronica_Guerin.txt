Veronica Guerin (July 5, 1958 - June 26, 1996) was an Irish journalist who was murdered in 1996 by Irish drug dealers. Her death made many Irish people angry, which brought down most drug dealers on the island. The criminal John Gilligan was later convicted of her murder and sentenced to 28 years in prison, though Gilligan said in High Court that it was his friend John Traynor who murdered Guerin.
