An umbrella term is a word that provides a superset or grouping of related concepts. Thus cryptology is an umbrella term that encompasses cryptography and cryptanalysis. Similarly, an "umbrella group" can be an organization which is a central and co-ordinating body representing a number of smaller, separate bodies.
