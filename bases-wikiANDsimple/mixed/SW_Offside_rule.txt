The offside rule is one of the oldest soccer rules, but is still a much discussed rule. The reason for this is the fact that today there are different perspectives of the cameras which film a soccer game, so all people can see when the referee makes a mistake.
The offside is a offence of the team which has the ball and gets punished with a free kick.
At the point of time of the pass there have to be at least two players between the goal line and the offensive player.
