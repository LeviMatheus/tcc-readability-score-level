A microscope is a scientific instrument that makes things normally too small to see look bigger, so they can be seen better and examined correctly. People who use microscopes commonly in their jobs include doctors and scientists.
The earliest microscopes had only 1 lens and are called "simple microscopes". "Compound microscopes" have at least 2 lenses.
In a compound microscope, the lens closer to the eye is called the "eyepiece". The lens at the other end is called the "objective".
Microscopes make things seem larger than they are, from 10 times larger to about 1000 times larger. This is much stronger than a magnifying glass.
