Cosmicomics () is a collection of twelve short stories by Italo Calvino first published in Italian in 1965 and in English in 1968. The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals "Il Caff√®" and "Il Giorno". Each story takes a scientific "fact" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it. An always-extant being called Qfwfq narrates all of the stories save two. Every story is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's "t zero".
All of the stories in "Cosmicomics", together with those from "t zero" and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, "The Complete Cosmicomics" (Penguin UK, 2009).
The first U.S. edition, translated by William Weaver, won the National Book Award in the Translation category.
