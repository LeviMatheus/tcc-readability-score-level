United Earth Starfleet's "Enterprise" is the main setting of "" (2001–2005). "Enterprise" was the first Earth built starship capable of reaching Warp 5. The ship was commanded by Captain Jonathan Archer and played an instrumental role in the founding of several proto-Federation alliances. "Enterprise" had significant engagements with the Klingons, Suliban, Xindi and the Romulans and playing a central role in the "Temporal Cold War." It is also featured as a model in "Star Trek Into Darkness".
"The Original Series" era.

The Federation's first "Enterprise" is the main setting of the original series (1966–1969) and ' (1973–74). Having undergone an extensive rebuilding and refitting, "Enterprise" then appears in ' (1979), ' (1982), and ' (1984) in which the starship is destroyed by its crew to escape capture by a Klingon Bird Of Prey. The bridge of the iconic vessel appears on the holodeck of the "Enterprise"-D in the "TNG" episode "". The ship also appears in the "Deep Space Nine" episode "Trials and Tribble-ations", as well as in the closing montage of the final "Enterprise" episode "These Are the Voyages...". This version also appears briefly in the comedy film . 
Details of the ship's appearance differed prior to the time period of the original series, including a transparent dome ceiling for the bridge that appeared in the 1965 pilot episode ", as shown in a flashback to Captain Pike's command in " (1966). A significantly redesigned version of Captain Pike's "Enterprise" appears in ""s , set several years after the events of "The Cage". The new design for the "Enterprise", which more closely matches the aesthetic of "Discovery", debuted in 2018 at the conclusion of the .
When the "Enterprise" was reintroduced in the 1979 film "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", the ship had just completed an extensive refit and redesign that included new slimmer warp nacelles, connected to the secondary hull by angled winglike struts. The updated design would be reused later for the "Enterprise"s replacement, an identical starship given the name "Enterprise" and registry number NCC-1701-A.

The "Enterprise"-B was launched at the beginning of the film "Star Trek Generations" (1994). During the ship's maiden voyage, prior to it being properly fitted with essential systems, the crew encountered an energy ribbon known as the Nexus, through which James T. Kirk - captain of the two former Enterprise starships, NCC-1701 and NCC-1701-A - was officially declared missing and presumed dead.
The design of the "Enterprise"-B is nearly identical to that of the USS "Excelsior", which first appeared in the 1984 film "Star Trek III: The Search For Spock." Differences between the "Enterprise"-B and the "Excelsior" include: flarings on the outside of the secondary hull, additional and larger impulse engines, and slight differences between the nacelles as well as the bridge modules. Non-canon information concerning the "Enterprise"-B includes several licensed "Star Trek" novels in which Demora Sulu, daughter of Hikaru Sulu, followed Harriman as captain. There are also licensed guides, such as the "Haynes Enterprise Manual", in which a list of the ship's captains includes Demora Sulu, William George, and Thomas Johnson Jr.

Service: 2409–ongoing 
Captain: Va'Kel Shon
One version of USS "Enterprise" (NCC-1701-F) appears in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game "Star Trek Online". Its design is based on the entry submitted by Adam Ihle for the 2011 "Design the next "Enterprise"" contest, a joint venture between Cryptic Studios, CBS, and Intel, which ran shortly before the game went "free to play". "Enterprise"-F made its first appearance in the mission "Boldly They Rode", at the point where USS "Enterprise"-F appears to help the player defeat the Dominion fleet surrounding Deep Space Nine.
Mirror universe.
The Mirror Universe first appeared in the original series as an alternate reality where the militaristic Terran Empire exists in place of the regular universe's United Federation of Planets (""). A montage in the opening credits of the "Star Trek: Enterprise" episode "In a Mirror, Darkly" shows the Terran Empire logo in use by at least World War II, with licensed novels putting the divergence before Shakespeare, or even classic Greek literature.
Registry: ISS "Enterprise" (NX-01)

A Mirror Universe "Enterprise" appears in the original "Star Trek" episode "". The ship is equipped with an agony booth and the mirror in the captain's quarters conceals Captain Kirk's deadly Tantalus device. ISS "Enterprise" was originally the same shooting model as the regular "Enterprise". The remastered version of "Mirror, Mirror" includes a CGI version of "Enterprise" with "ISS" markings on the hull and minor physical differences from USS "Enterprise", such as a larger deflector dish, a taller bridge, and altered nacelle details. The ship was also shown orbiting the planet in the opposite direction (clockwise instead of counter-clockwise).
Reboot ("Kelvin" Timeline) films.
The 2009 "Star Trek" film takes place in a new reality created when the Romulan character Nero traveled through time via an artificial black hole created by red matter. 
Registry: 
Service: 2258–2263 (5 years)
Captains: Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)
The main setting for the films "Star Trek" (2009), "Star Trek Into Darkness" (2013), and "Star Trek Beyond" (2016). "Enterprise" is shown during its construction phase at the Riverside Shipyard in Iowa during the first film. A brief shot of the NCC-1701 is seen as the shuttlecraft carrying Kirk and the new recruits into space departs the shipyard later on in the movie. At the end of "Star Trek Into Darkness", "Enterprise" started its five-year mission. The ship was later destroyed by Krall and his alien swarm attack during the events of "Star Trek Beyond".
Measurements of this ship's length have ranged from 295 meters to 910 meters. In an article about the 2009 film's visual effects, "Cinefex" wrote, "The reconfigured ship was a larger vessel than previous manifestations – approximately long compared to the ship of the original series", and quoted Industrial Light &amp; Magic art director Alex Jaeger discussing the design's growth in size during early production of the film: "Once we got the ship built and started putting it in environments it felt too small. The shuttle bay gave us a clear relative scale – shuttlecraft initially appeared much bigger than we had imagined – so we bumped up the Enterprise scale, which gave her a grander feel and allowed us to include more detail."
A special feature on starships in the Blu-ray (BD) version of the movie gives the length as , which would be larger than the "Next Generation" D and E versions, making it the largest USS "Enterprise" in the franchise history (not counting the pre-Federation era "Enterprise" (XCV 330), seen only as a model). This would result in a height of 167m, and a beam of 339m.
Registry: 
Class: "Constitution"
Service: 2263–ongoing
Captains: James T. Kirk (Chris Pine)
"Enterprise"-A first appears at the end of "Star Trek Beyond" after the destruction of the original "Enterprise" when the crew resume their five-year mission.
Sean Hargreaves stated that he was given the brief to "beef up the neck and arms" on the Ryan Church design, but went further to give the ship echoes of Matt Jefferies' original design.
Development.
According to "The Star Trek Encyclopedia", the registry number NCC-1701 was devised by Matt Jefferies, art director of the first "Star Trek" series, inspired by an old science fiction cover that Gene Roddenberry liked, with a starship flying through space. Jefferies, who was a pilot, based NCC on United States aircraft pre-1949 registration codes. In such pre-1949 usage, an "N" first letter refers to an aircraft registered in the United States. A "C" for a second letter refers to a civil aircraft. Jefferies added a second "C" because he thought it looked better.
The Franz Joseph "Blueprints", the book "The Making of Star Trek", and a handful of "Star Trek" novels speculate that NCC is an initialism for "Naval Construction Contract".
In an interview with the BBC, Jefferies explained that NC is the designation for U.S. commercial aircraft and the Soviet Union's space program used the CCCP designation. He concluded that any major future space projects would likely be a combined international effort, thus he invented the combined designation NCC. The 1701 had two functions, it represented the first (01) ship of a 17th federation cruiser design, and that the digits were unlikely to be misread, unlike 6, 8, or 9.
In Gene Roddenberry's original "Star Trek" pitch, the starship is described as a "United Space Ship", and in two episodes of "The Original Series" (TOS), Kirk refers to the "United Space Ship "Enterprise"".
Redesign for "Star Trek: Planet of the Titans".
In 1976, before ', Paramount had planned a "Star Trek" film to have been named '. Early in the production, Ralph McQuarrie had been hired to redesign the "Enterprise". The major feature of the redesign was to replace the cigar-shaped secondary hull with a larger, triangle-shaped "delta wing" section. McQuarrie's design was discarded in favor of keeping the general shape of the "Enterprise" intact for the redesign unveiled in "".
Three decades later, the McQuarrie design for the "Enterprise" was adopted as the basis for the design of the USS "Discovery" in "", a 2017 series that takes place ten years earlier than the original "Star Trek".
Captain's yacht.
The captain's yacht is a large auxiliary starship built into the design of several Federation starship designs including the "Galaxy"-class and "Sovereign"-class. It was docked to the underside of the saucer section. On USS "Enterprise"-E, the name of the captain's yacht is the "Cousteau". In 2375, the crew of USS "Enterprise"-E used the "Cousteau" to travel to the surface of the Ba'ku homeworld.
Designer Andrew Probert came up with the concept of the captain's yacht while designing the USS "Enterprise"-D. Although it was never seen in use, it is labeled on the master systems display screen in main engineering, docked at the bottom of the saucer section almost directly opposite the main bridge. Probert suggested possible ways for the yacht to be used during the first season, including not showing the yacht but mentioning it in dialogue, but his ideas were rejected. The producers almost used the yacht in the episode "Samaritan Snare", but decided to use an "executive shuttlecraft" due to budgetary constraints. According to Patrick Stewart, the yacht would have been called the "Calypso". Producer Ronald D. Moore noted in the "Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual" that real-life naval tradition would insist on calling such a craft the captain's gig, rather than the captain's yacht.
Rick Sternbach later designed similar craft for USS "Voyager" and USS "Equinox", known as the aeroshuttle and the waverider, respectively. As on the "Enterprise"-D, however, these vessels were only depicted on technical schematics and never seen in operation or referred to in dialog.
Reception and influence.
Gizmodo's Io9 blog ranked the original design of the as the best version of the "Enterprise", characterizing the original as still superior to 11 later versions of the "Enterprise" that had appeared in the "Star Trek" franchise. Conversely, in 2019, SyFy ranked the refit design of the "Enterprise" (NCC-1701 and NCC-1701-A) as the franchise's best, ranking the original design as only the fourth best version of the starship.
"Time" described each iteration of the "Enterprise" as "a character in its own right". Over many decades, the starship has influenced real-life activities of NASA and the U.S. Navy:
Celebrity astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson has spoken highly of the influence and legacy of the original "Enterprise" on other fictional spaceships. Drawing a parallel to comparing athletes between eras, he said of spaceship design, "What matters is not what they look like now, but what they looked to others at the time that they prevailed... There is only one spaceship that's earlier than [the original "Enterprise"], and that's the flying saucer from "The Day the Earth Stood Still". So, what matters here is, what did [the "Enterprise"] look like at the time it came out (1966) compared with anything that had been imagined before? And when you consider that, that is the most astonishing machine that has ever graced the screen." On the ship's influence upon scientists, Tyson wrote, "The "Enterprise" was the first ever spaceship represented in storytelling that was not designed to go from one place to another; [it was] only designed to explore. It was revolutionary in terms of what we would think space would, and should, be about."
NetDragon Websoft, a gaming and mobile Internet company in Fuzhou, China, based the architectural design of its headquarters building on the "Next Generation"-era "Enterprise" (primarily the "Enterprise"-E), under an official license from CBS.
