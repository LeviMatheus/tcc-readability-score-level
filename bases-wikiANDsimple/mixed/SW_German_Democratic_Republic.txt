The German Democratic Republic (GDR'") (("DDR")), commonly called East Germany (), was founded on October 7,1949, after World War II. It was formed from the parts of Germany and Berlin occupied by the USSR.
After World War II, Germany was divided into four sections, each controlled by a different country. The countries that controlled these parts of Germany were France, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Then, the French, American, and British parts of Germany formed West Germany (the "Bundesrepublik") and the Soviet section was East Germany. Even though the western and the eastern part joined back together in 1990, people from former West Germany still call people from East Germany "Ossi". This comes from the German word "Osten" which means "East". Ossi is not always meant kindly.
In the German reunification, the GDR joined West Germany by ratifying its constitution in 1990. The East German districts were reorganised into the "Länder" (Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt and Thüringen) and joined West Germany, after which the GDR ceased to exist.
Some people thought the GDR was a puppet state of the Soviet Union.
East Germany was a member of the Warsaw Pact.
A famous relic of the GDR is the low-powered automobile "Trabant" or "Trabi".
