"Dr. Phil" is an American talk show hosted by Dr. Phil McGraw. It debuted on September 16, 2002, after McGraw had success with the "Tuesdays With Dr. Phil" segment on "The Oprah Winfrey Show". On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of "life strategies" from his experience as a clinical psychologist.
The show is in syndication throughout the United States and Canada, as well as a number of other countries. Also, the show's syndication contracts specifically state that if "Dr. Phil" is on another station, it cannot air at the same time as "Oprah".
The sixth season premiered on September 10, 2007.
It was announced on August 3, 2005 that Dr. Phil had been renewed through at least 2012-2013, lasting through the 11th season.
In 2007, Dr. Phil was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for "Outstanding Talk Show Host".
