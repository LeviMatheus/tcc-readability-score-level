The British Rail Class 504 was a unique type of electric multiple unit that ran on 1200 V DC third rail with side-contact current collection. The type was used only between Manchester and Bury. The units were originally built as three-car units. Overhaul at Wolverton saw the centre car removed and inserted into Class 304 sets instead.
