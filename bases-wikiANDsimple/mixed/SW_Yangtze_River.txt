The Yangtze River, or Yangzi, or Chang Jiang, is a river in China. It is the longest river in Asia and the third longest in the world (after the Amazon and the Nile).
The river is about 6,300 kilometers (almost 4,000 miles) long and goes from the western part of China (Qinghai Province) into the East China Sea, which is part of the Pacific Ocean. It has been thought of as a dividing point between northern and southern China. It helped start the Chinese civlization.
