Hugo Rafael Chávez Frías (IPA:) (born July 28, 1954) is the current president of Venezuela. He is the leader of the "Bolivarian Revolution" and promotes his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism. Chávez is also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and U.S. foreign policy.
Chávez is career military officer. He founded the left-wing Fifth Republic Movement after a failed coup d'état against former President Carlos Andrés Pérez. Chávez was
elected to serve as president in 1998. This was mainly because he promised to help the poor majority of Venezuelan people. He was re-elected in 2000, and 2006. He started a movement called Bolivarian Missions. Its goal is to fight disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, and other social problems. Abroad, Chávez is known for supporting alternative models of economic development. He has also spoken in favor of a collaboration of poor nations, especially those in Latin America.
Chávez's reforms have caused controversy, both inside Venezuela, and outside the country. Some people criticized the reforms, others supported them. Those people who support the reforms say that he has given more power to the poor, and that he has stimulated economic growth. Those who argue against the reforms say that he is an autocraŧ who has mismanaged the economy.
Some governments, especially the government of the United States see Chávez as a threat to global oil prices, as well as to regional stability. Others sympathize with his ideology or welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements.
In 2005 and 2006 he was named one of "Time" magazine's 100 most influential people.
