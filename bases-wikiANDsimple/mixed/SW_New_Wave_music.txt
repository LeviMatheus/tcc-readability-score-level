New Wave (or New Wave music) is a style of pop music that developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. New wave music was inspired by the punk rockmovement.
New Wave music is rock music mixed with other types of music, such as punk rock music, funk, disco, and ska.
New wave bands such as the Talking Heads were anti-corporate, experimental, and had complex lyrics. Other new wave bands included Blondie, Television, Patti Smith, The Jam, The B-52's, Devo, Jungle Street, and Elvis Costello. New wave music was rebellious like punk rock. But new wave music was usually not as angry and aggressive as punk rock.
When MTV started broadcasting in 1981, many New Wave bands had their music videos played on television. This made New Wave music more popular. A well-known New Wave video is "Whip It" by Devo.
