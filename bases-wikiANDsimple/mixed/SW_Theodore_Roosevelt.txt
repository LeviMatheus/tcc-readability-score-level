Theodore "Teddy" Roosevelt (1858â€“1919), was the 26th president of the United States. He was born in New York. He was a member of the Republican Party. Roosevelt passed many laws when he was president to help ordinary people. He used his power to stop big companies and rich people who owned them from making life hard for their workers.
As president, he was interested in what happened in other countries. In 1905, he helped end the war between the Russian and Japanese empires. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for it in 1906.
The popular stuffed animal doll, the "Teddy bear", was named after Roosevelt. He was so popular that his face was put on Mount Rushmore.
