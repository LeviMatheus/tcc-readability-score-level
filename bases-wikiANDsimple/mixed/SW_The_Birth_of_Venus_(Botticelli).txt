"The Birth of Venus" is a painting by Sandro Botticelli. It is of a Roman goddess who was called Venus. He pictured her standing on a shell because Venus was said to have been born from the sea.
It shows Zephyr, the god of the winds, blowing her toward the shore where another goddess is awaiting her with a cloak. She is pictured naked to show her innocence and divinity.
