English translation.
Take a look at my country.
They did not give up their pride
As your flower I will be planted,
As your song I will stream, my country!
My native land — My Kazakhstan!
The way was opened to the posterity
As your flower I will be planted,
As your song I will stream, my country!
My native land — My Kazakhstan!
