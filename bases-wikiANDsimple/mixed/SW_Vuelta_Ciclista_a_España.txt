The Vuelta Ciclista a España (also Vuelta a España, or simply Vuelta) is a long-distance bicycle race. The first race was in 1935. The Tour de France and Giro d'Italia were both very successful, and both run by newspaper companies. A newspaper called "Informaciones" in Spain decided to start a similar race in Spain. It is now one of the three "Grand Tours" of Europe and, after the Tour de France and the Giro d'Italia, is the third most important road cycling stage race in the world.
The leader of the race wears the "Jersey de Oro", the golden jersey. This is the same as the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. The leader of the mountain climbers' competition wears a green jersey. The leader of the sprinters' competition wears a blue jersey with gold fish (this is because the Spanish fishing industry pays for the jersey.
The race was run in the Spring until 1995. Since 1995 it has been run in September.
