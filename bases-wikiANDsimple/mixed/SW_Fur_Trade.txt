The fur trade is a worldwide industry dealing in the gain and sale of animal fur.
Before the colonization of the Americas, Russia was a major fur supplier of Western Europe and parts of Asia.
The North American fur trade was a central part of the early history of contact in The New World (North America) between European-Americans and Native Americans in the United States and First Nations in Canada.
