The "Iliad" is, along with the "Odyssey", one of the two major Greek epic poems traditionally attributed to Homer, written in Greece about 700â€“650 BC.
The poem is embedded in the Trojan War between the Greeks and Trojans. It tells the story from the wrath of Achilles, to the death and funeral of Hector and the siege of Troy.
The "Iliad" was followed by the "Odyssey", maybe also written by Homer.
Some important characters in the "Iliad" are Achilles, Odysseus, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Priam, Hector, Paris, and Helen.
Plot.
The poem starts with the god Apollo having sent a plague to the Greeks, because they captured the daughter of one of his priests. Agamemnon is forced to give her back, but also takes away Briseis from her owner Achilles. Achilles is angry and refuses to fight. But when his friend Patroclus is killed by Hector, he starts to fight again and kills Hector in a duel. Later Hector's father Priam comes in secret to Achilles to take back his favorite son's body to give it a proper funeral, which Achilles allows him to do. The poem ends with the funeral of Hector.
