The Turks and Caicos Islands are two groups of islands that are owned by the British. They are in the Caribbean Sea, near the Bahamas. Fishing is the biggest part of the economy.
The ruler of Great Britain is also the ruler of the Turks and Caicos, but that ruler always acts through a governor. There are no elections for president, and all the officers of government are named by the ruler, or "monarch".
Grand Turk.
This is the main island where all the government offices are held. Grand Turk is the capital of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It has its own International Airport.
Providenciales.
Often shortened to just 'Provo', this island has its own International Airport and is host to a large number of holiday resorts including Sandals' Beaches resort. A large coral reef is situated to the north of the island. To the east of the island, a new development named "Leewood" is being built.
West Cay.
Known as the place 'where everyone moves on golf carts' because the island is so small. There are few beaches. The main income is salt processing. It does not have an airport.
