The Bundesverwaltungsgericht or "Federal Administrative Court" is one of the five federal supreme courts of Germany. It is the federal court of appeals for generally all cases of administrative law, mainly arguments between people and the government.
It hears appeals from the "Oberverwaltungsgerichte", or Superior Administrative Courts, which, in turn, are the courts of appeals for decisions of the "Verwaltungsgerichte" (Administrative Courts).
Although cases about social security law are arguments between a person and the government, there are special courts for these matters. The Bundessozialgericht is federal court of appeals. Cases of tax and customs law are decided by the "Finanzgerichte" (Finance Courts), and lastly by the Bundesfinanzhof.
The "Bundesverwaltungsgericht" has its headquarters at the former "Reichsgericht" (Reich Court of Justice) building in Leipzig.
