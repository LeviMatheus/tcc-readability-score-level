Its average temperature is much warmer than many of the other states, but during winter, temperatures may occasionally fall below 32 degrees Fahrenheit. In Florida there are many palm trees. Palm trees grow in places that have a warm climate and a lot of sunshine. Florida has both a rainy season and a dry season. Florida does not have four separate seasons.
Florida's sunny climate also attracts visitors. The summer is a great opportunity to surf the waves and enjoy the beaches. The most popular sport in Florida is fishing. A lot of people also like to visit the beaches on the west side of Florida, such as near Tampa.
