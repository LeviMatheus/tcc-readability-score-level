In 1980 Sarrionandia was arrested by Spanish police for being a member of ETA. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison. In 1985 he escaped from prison with IÃ±aki Pikaea during a concert in the jail with Basque singer Imanol Larzabal. They hid themselves inside a loudspeaker. The Basque rock group Kortatu wrote the song "Sarri, Sarri" in honor of this. He has lived in secret since his escape and writes a lot about exile.
Sarrionandia has written books and poems which have been sung by different Basque singers. There's also an audio book called "Hau da ene ondasun guzia" of Sarrionandia reading his own poems as well as many songs performed by different singers.
One of his poems.
Captive in the rainforests of the West
they brought yo to Rome, slave,
they gave you the blacksmith work
The red iron that you carry out the oven
can be adapted as you want,
in order that your people could break the chains,
