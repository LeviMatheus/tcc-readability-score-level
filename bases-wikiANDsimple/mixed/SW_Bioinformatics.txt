Bioinformatics is the study of big amounts of biological information. Mostly focusing on molecules like DNA. It is done mostly with the help of computers.
The process.
Anything a cell could possibly want is stored in its DNA. When a cell wants to build a protein, it finds the appropriate piece of DNA, unravels it, and uses it to make the protein.
Proteins are made from "amino acids". There are twenty amino acids in each protein molecule. Proteins are the 'machinery' of a cell. They can perform many functions like transportation, structural support, movement and metabolism.
The principle of bioinformatics is that everything making up these molecules can be studied by studying the DNA in it and therefore find out more about how it work.
Computers in bioinformatics.
Chemists have developed ways for understanding the shape and behavior of small molecules, using mathematical analysis. They might use computers (or even just a pencil and paper) to study these molecules.
Biochemists today are trying to answer these questions about every single cell in the body.
