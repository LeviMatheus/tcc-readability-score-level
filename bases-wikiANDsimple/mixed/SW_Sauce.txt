Sauce is a hot or a cold liquid that is added to another food to add flavor to it. Sauces are not eaten by themselves, they are always added to another dish. A sauce can be something simple, like liquid butter or something fancier like a sauce with cream and ham (called "Carbonara") or with ground meat (called "Bolognese"), or even with herbs and garlic (called "Pesto").
An example would be a tomato-based sauce that is usually poured over spaghetti before it is eaten. Gravy is a brown sauce served with meat.
