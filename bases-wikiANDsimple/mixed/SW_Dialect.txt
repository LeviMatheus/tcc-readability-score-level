A dialect is a type of language spoken by a group of people. Sometimes people who live in the same place make a dialect. Sometimes people who are similar in some way make a dialect.
There is no agreed difference between a "dialect" and a "language". Some dialects are called "languages". They may spell words differently and be known as a language (for example, English is a Germanic dialect).
Other dialects different types of a language that come from different places or countries (for example, British English and American English are dialects of English).
