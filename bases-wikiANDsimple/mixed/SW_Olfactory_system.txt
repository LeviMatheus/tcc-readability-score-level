The olfactory system is the sensory system used for olfaction or the sense of smell.
Function.
In mammals, the olfactory system gets smells through the nose. When the smell is breathed in through the nose, it stimulates sensory receptors. These can tell if the smell is new or old.
Damage.
Damage to the olfactory system can happen through brain injury, cancer or toxic gases. The damage is usually measured by doctors giving the patient something to smell and having the patient try to guess what it is.
