Vancouver Island is in the province of British Columbia in Canada. You can go there by boat from Vancouver (across the Strait of Georgia) or from the state of Washington (across the Strait of Juan de Fuca). Over 500,000 people live on the island. The first people to live on the island, before Europeans came, were the Nuu-chah-nulth, Salish, and Kwakiutl. The University of Victoria is located on Vancouver Island.
