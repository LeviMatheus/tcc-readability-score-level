To teach is to help students to learn new knowledge or skills. To teach someone is to help him or her learn from explanations or experiments. Professors and teachers teach: it is their work (or "job"). Parents also teach their children, but parents also do many other things with their children.
People have different ideas about the aim of teaching. Some people want to teach so the learner can learn things that make them happy, for example to learn how to do a job they like. Other people think learners should learn something useful for their family, relatives, or community. Some people think teachers should teach people how to obey God.
There are many different places where teaching happens. Some people teach very young children in schools called elementary schools. Others teach older children in middle, junior high, and high schools. Some teachers teach adults in colleges, or universities.
