Gymnastics is a sport which involves running, jumping, tumbling, somersaulting, and balancing.
For girls, there are four pieces of equipment that the gymnasts do tricks on: floor, bars, beam and vault.
For boys, there are six pieces of equipment that the gymnasts do tricks on: floor, parallel bars, high bar, pommel horse, vault and the rings.
Gymnasts can compete with other gymnasts to see who can do their tricks better. Usually the winner gets a trophy, ribbon, or a medal.
History.
Gymnastics began as a form of Calishtenics in early Greek times. It came about when a man jumped over a bull, and a series of competitions involving athletics is what it turned into. It involved running, carrying weights, climbing ropes, and jumping over hurdles. It was one of the first sports in the Olympics, and originally only men were allowed to do it.
When modern gymnastics came along, then apparatus (floor, bars, beams, pommel horses, rings and vaults) came into play. Women still had not practiced gymnastics until later times, and they had to compete on different apparatus.
Forms of gymnastics.
There are several forms of gymnastics, including: rhythmic gymnastics, acrobatics and trampolining. Artistic gymnastics is the one which a gymnast performs on apparatus, acrobatics is performing flips, and trampolining is doing flips on only one apparatus (the trampoline). Rhythmic gymnastics is where a gymnast works with the apparatus (ribbons, rope, ball, hoop and clubs) and is performed only by women.
