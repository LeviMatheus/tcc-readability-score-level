A multi-core CPU is a computer processor which has two or more sections. The actual processors are still one chip. On this chip every core looks mostly like the other. They are several mostly independent cores which work parallel together. A single-core processor is a multi-core processor with only one microprocessor. A dual-core processor is a multi-core processor with two independent microprocessors. Consequently the quad-core processor is a multi-core processor with four independent microprocessors. As you can see, the number of the microprocessors is responsible for the name of the processor.
History.
Until 2005 single-core processors dominated the pc-area. In the years before there were only multi-core solutions used in individual cases. In the majority of cases they enhanced the frequency. But at a frequency about 4 GHz the heat losses were too big. This was the point when multi-core processors became more important. Therefore the bargain of multi-core processors increased. In the second half of 2006 the best processors were dual-core processors. Since 2006 the development has gone on, so that the new processors get four or more independent microprocessors. Nowadays the usage of single-core processors is just a little fraction because they are just used for individual cases.
Conclusion.
In the next years the trend will go to multi-core processors more and more.
The main reason is that they are faster than single-core processors and they can be still improved. But in the future there will be still some applications for single-core processors because not every system needs a fast processor.
