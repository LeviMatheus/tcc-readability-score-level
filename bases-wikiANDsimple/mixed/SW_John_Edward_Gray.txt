John Edward Gray (February 12, 1800 â€“ March 7, 1875) was a English zoologist. He studied medicine in London, and became head of the Zoological collection in 1840. During his life he wrote over 500 academic papers, mostly on new species.
Gray was also interested in postage stamps; on 1 May 1840, the day the Penny Black first went on sale, he bought some to keep, thus making him the world's first known stamp collector.
