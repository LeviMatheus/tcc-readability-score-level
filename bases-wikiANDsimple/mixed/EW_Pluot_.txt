Pluots, apriums, apriplums, or plumcots, are some of the hybrids between different "Prunus" species that are also called interspecific plums. Whereas plumcots and apriplums are first-generation hybrids between a plum parent ("P. salicina") and an apricot ("P. armeniaca"), pluots and apriums are later-generations. Both names "plumcot" and "apriplum" have been used for trees derived from a plum seed parent, and are therefore equivalent.
Plumcots and apriplums.
Natural plumcots (also called apriplums) have been known for hundreds of years from regions of the world that grow both plums and apricots from seed. The name "plumcot" was created by Luther Burbank. The plumcot tree can reproduce asexually by budding whereas the apriplum tree resulted from hybridized seedlings and cannot reproduce.
Pluots.
Pluots are later generations of complex hybrid between the Japanese plum, "Prunus salicina" (providing the greater amount of parentage), and the apricot, "Prunus armeniaca". The fruit's exterior has smooth skin closely resembling that of a plum. Pluots were developed in the late 20th century by Floyd Zaiger.
Apriums.
Floyd Zaiger created the aprium, a hybrid cross between apricots and plums but more similar to apricots. Apriums are complex plum-apricot hybrids that show primarily apricot traits and flavor. Apriums resemble apricots on the outside. The flesh is usually dense and notable for its sweet taste due to a high content of fructose and other sugars. Apriums are usually only available early in the fruit season, like apricots and unlike pluots, which include some very late-ripening varieties. Aprium trees grow quickly and are smaller compared to other common home-grown apricots. The fruit is gold, with red coloration. Semi-mature fruit is hard and does not ripen if picked before completely mature.
