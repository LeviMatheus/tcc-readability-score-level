A teenager, or teen, is a young person whose age is between thirteen and nineteen. They are called teenagers because their age number end in "teen".
Teenagers go through a lot of changes during this time. This is called adolescence or puberty. In the United States, some teenagers go to middle school and some go to high school. In the United Kingdom (UK), teenagers and non-teens mix in secondary school.
