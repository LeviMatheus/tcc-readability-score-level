Syphilis is a disease. It is one of the sexually transmitted diseases. This means it can be spread by having sex. Condoms can prevent it from spreading.
The disease is caused by a bacterium, called "Treponema pallidum". Most transmissions occur through the sexual route. Very rarely, it can also be spread by direct contact, or from the mother to the child.
Since it is caused by a bacterium, the disease can be treated (and cured) by antibiotics, especially by penicillin.
