The Ottoman Dynasty (or the Imperial House of Osman) ruled the Ottoman Empire from 1281 to 1923. The dynasty began with Osman I, but it was not recognized until 1383 when Murad I declared himself sultan. The dynasty might have been known as Söğüt before 1383, but it was later renamed "Osmanlı" (Ottoman in English) in honor of Osman I.
The sultan was the sole and absolute ruler of the empire. The power was often shifted to other officials, such as the Grand Vizier.
