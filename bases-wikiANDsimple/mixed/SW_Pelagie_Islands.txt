The Pelagie Islands are three islands in the Mediterranean. They are Lampedusa, Linosa and Lampione. They are between Malta and Tunisia. They are part of the African continent but belong to Italy.
Because of deforestation, the islands are very barren. In the past they lived on agriculture, but nowadays they live on fishing and tourism.
