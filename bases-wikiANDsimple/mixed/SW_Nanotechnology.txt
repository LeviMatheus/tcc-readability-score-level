Nanotechnology is a field of applied science and technology that is about the control of matter on the atomic and molecular scale, generally 100 nanometers or smaller, and the development of devices with critical dimensions that lie within that size range.
Overview.
Nanotechnology is a highly multidisciplinary field, drawing from areas such as applied physics, materials science, interface and colloid science, device physics, supramolecular chemistry (which refers to the area of chemistry that focuses on the noncovalent bonding interactions of molecules), self-replicating machines and robotics, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, biological engineering, and electrical engineering
