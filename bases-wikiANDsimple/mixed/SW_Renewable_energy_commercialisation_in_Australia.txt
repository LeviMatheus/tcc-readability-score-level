Australia's renewable energy industries cover numerous energy sources and stages of commercialisation. Renewable energy technologies currently contribute about 6 per cent of Australia's total energy supply and some 8 per cent of Australia's electricity supply, with hydro-electricity by far the largest single contributor.
Following the introduction of government Mandatory Renewable Energy Targets, more opportunities have opened up for "new" renewable energies such as wind power, photovoltaics, and solar thermal technologies. The deployment of these technologies provides opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases.
At the end of 2006, Australia had 817 MW of installed wind power capacity, mainly in South Australia. A 154 MW, A$420 million, solar photovoltaic power station is planned for Victoria.
Initiatives are also being taken with ethanol fuel and geothermal energy exploration.
Marketing strategies of private companies, and government policies, influence the commercialisation process. Survey results suggest that there is considerable public support for the use of renewable energy and energy efficiency in Australia.
