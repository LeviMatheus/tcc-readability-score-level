San Marino is one of the smallest countries in the world. It is found in southern Europe, fully surrounded by Italy and fewer than 30,000 people live there. Its total area is 61km2.
San Marino is the world's oldest republic still in existence, since it was founded in A.D. 301 by a skilled builder referred to as Saint Marinus. Its written constitution was adopted on October 8, 1600. The very small nation was recognized by Napoleon's France in 1797, and by the other European nations at the 1815 Congress of Vienna.
Even though it is an independent country, it is strongly dependent on Italy. Since the 19th century, when Italy was unified, San Marino has been fully surrounded by Italy.
The dominant industry in San Marino is tourism. Selling postage stamps is an important source of income, too. San Marino is not a member of the European Union, but the euro is used in San Marino.
