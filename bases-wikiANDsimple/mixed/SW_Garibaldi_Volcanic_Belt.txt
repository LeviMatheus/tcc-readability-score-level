The Garibaldi Volcanic Belt is the northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Belt in the northwestern United States and contains the most explosive eruptions in Canada. Its volcanoes are also the closest to British Columbia's densely populated southwest corner. These volcanoes are the result of subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate; the plates meet just seaward of the west coast of Vancouver Island. The volcanoes of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt generally are stratovolcanoes typical of subduction zones, and include Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley and Mount Meager. Meager's eruption 2,350 years ago is the youngest explosive eruption in Canada. It was similar similar to that of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and the ongoing eruption of Montserrat in the Caribbean.
