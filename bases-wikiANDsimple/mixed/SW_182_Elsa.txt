182 Elsa is a Main belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Johann Palisa on February 7, 1878. What it is named after is uncertain; it may be named after the character in the legend of Lohengrin perpetuated by Richard Wagner's opera of the same name.
It rotates very slowly; its rotation period (or "day") is about 3.3 Earth days. A possible moon has been suggested to explain the slow rotation.
Elsa has very amplified lightcurve indicating a stretched or non-spherical body. It was one of five minor planets included in the 1993 study, Transition Comets -- UV Search for OH Emissions in Asteroids, which was research involving non-professional astronomers who were allowed to make use of the Hubble Space Telescope.
