Andy Gibb (March 5, 1958- March 10, 1988) was a pop singer popular in the 1970s. He was the younger brother of Barry, Maurice, and Robin Gibb, The Bee Gees. He died of a heart problem in 1988, shortly after his 30th birthday. While his years of alcohol and cocaine abuse were not the direct cause of death, they certainly did not help his condition.
