Shalom (שלום) is a Hebraic word which means "peace". Like in English, it can concerns as well the peace between two parts, as an inner peace, being calm or the quietness of a person. It is also used as a mathod of greeting which is equal to "hello", "good day (morning, afternoon, high noon...)" or "good bye".
The root of the word "shalom" can be realted to "le-shalem" which means "to complete, to reward, to pay, to compensate". For this one can say that it is more than the absence of conflict of opposition (struggle) or the breaking of the unfriendliness. But "shalom" also means a return to the balance, to justice, and to the complete equality.
In general, one uses the word "shalom" as the short form of the sentence "Shalom Aleichem" (exactly "Peace is with you") that can be translated as "good day (morning, afternoon, high noon...)" (a greeting). This is very similar to the Arabic phrase "Salam Alaykum" (سلام عليكم) which is again a greeting meaning "Peace be with you".
