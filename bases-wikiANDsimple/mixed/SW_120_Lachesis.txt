120 Lachesis is a very big and very dark main belt asteroid. As a primitive C-type asteroid it is likely made of carbonates. It was found by Alphonse Borrelly on April 10, 1872 and named after one of the Moirae, or Fates, in Greek mythology. The only seen Lachesean occultation happened in 1999 and was recorded in the south-western United States.
