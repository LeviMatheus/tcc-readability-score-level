A Natural resource is a thing people can use which comes from Nature: people do not make it themselves. Examples of natural resources are air, water, wood, oil, solar energy, wind energy, coal water, minerals. Petroleum used in cars is not a natural resource, for example, because people make it.
We often say there are two sorts of natural resource: "renewable resources" and "non-renewable resources".
in every country or place can get all natural resources. When people do not have one resource where they live, they can a) use another resource, or b) trade with another country (for example, they can buy oil from their neighbors). Some resources are rare - difficult to find - so people sometimes fight to have them (for example, oil resources).
When people do not have some natural resources their quality of life can drop. For example, when they can not get clean water, people may become ill; if there is not enough wood, all trees will be cut and the forest will disappear (deforestation); if there are not enough fish in a sea, people can die of starvation. Some examples of renewable resources are wood, solar energy, trees, wind, hydroelectric power, fish and sunlight.
