A tenor is a man with a high singing voice. In opera the role of the hero is usually sung by a tenor. A “Heldentenor” (German for “hero tenor”) is someone with a big tenor voice suitable for heroic parts like the heroes in most of Wagner’s operas. Luciano Pavarotti was a heroic tenor. José Carreras, Placido Domingo and Roberto Alagno are famous heroic tenors.
Some tenors have lighter, more lyrical voices. Peter Pears, who sang the tenor solos in Benjamin Britten’s operas, had a lyrical tenor voice.
When writing four-part choir music the tenor line will be the third line down, between alto and bass. It is usually written in the treble clef, but will sound an octave lower than written.
