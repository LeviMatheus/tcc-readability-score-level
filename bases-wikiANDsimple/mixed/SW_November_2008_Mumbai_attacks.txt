The November 2008 Mumbai attacks were twelve attacks of terror happening at the same time across Mumbai, India, from 26 November 2008. 172 people were killed and 293 were injured.
A group called Deccan Mujahideen which was not known before, has said it was responsible for the attacks. It is possible that they are a part of the Indian Mujahideen.
Responsibility.
Around fifty to sixty terrorists took part in the attacks. They looked young, in their early twenties, and wore T-shirts, black shirts, and jeans. "The Guardian" has said that they seemed "cool and composed" and "in no hurry".
Police officers who rescued hostages at the Chabad House were surprised that the terrorists looked "white" and either non-Indian or from the country's far north. The terrorists had planned the attack several months before. They set up "control rooms" in the two luxury hotels that were targeted.
A previously unknown group, the Deccan Mujahideen, claimed responsibility. They sent emails to news organizations. "The New York Times" has stated that international security experts "drew a blank on" the Deccan Mujahideen group, with one analyst labeling it a "front name". In September, the Indian Mujahideen had warned of future attacks. Their message said that "you are already on our hit-list and this time very, very seriously."
According to a witness, the gunmen were looking for American and British passport holders and left others alone, such as a man claiming to be Italian. At the same time, "The Independent" has reported that "the attackers were young South Asian men speaking Hindi or Urdu suggesting they are probably members of an Indian militant group rather than foreigners".
