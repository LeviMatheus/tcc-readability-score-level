Tropical Depression 10 was the first tropical cyclone in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season that did not make it to tropical storm force strength.
Storm history.
Tropical Depression Ten formed 1100 statute miles (1770 km) east of the Lesser Antilles on August 13. Throughout its entire life-span, conditions were not favorable for development, as strong vertical wind shear eventually ripped the system apart after forming, and advisories were stopped the next day when it showed no organized deep convection. The remnants of Tropical Depression Ten continued drifting northwestward before degenerating into a tropical wave north of the Leeward Islands. The mid-level remnant circulation eventually merged with another system in the "complex genesis" of what would become Tropical Depression Twelve and, eventually, Hurricane Katrina.
