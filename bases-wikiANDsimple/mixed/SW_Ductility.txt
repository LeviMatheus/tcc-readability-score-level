Ductility is the physical property of being capable of sustaining large permanent changes in shape without breaking (in metals, such as being drawn into a wire). It is characterized by the internal structure of the material flowing under shear stress.
Definition.
Ductility is the amount that any material yields under shear stress. Gold, copper, aluminium, and steel express high ductility.
