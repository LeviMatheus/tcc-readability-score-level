Robert Walpole, 1st Earl of Orford was born in Houghton, Norfolk on August 26 1676. He died on March 18 1745. He was England's first Prime Minister in 1721. He was Prime Minister for a longer amount of time than anyone who came after him.
Literally, he was not the first prime minister of Great Britain, because the term wasn't actually used until 1905, he was actually the "First Lord of the Treasury". Therefore the first British prime minister was Henry Campbell-Bannerman because the term "Prime Minister" started being used 5 days after he was elected.
