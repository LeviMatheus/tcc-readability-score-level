Squirrels are a family rodents that includes marmots and chipmunks. Most squirrels are omnivores; they eat anything they find. Many kinds of squirrels live in trees, so they often find nuts. Despite living in trees squirrels are considered flightless because they can only jump short distances. They eat seeds, berries and pine cones too. Sometimes they eat bird's eggs and insects. Most tree squirrels store food in the fall, to eat in the winter. Ground squirrels don't store food. They hibernate which means they spend winter in a deep sleep. Squirrels are well known in Eurasia and North America. The most common European squirrels are red or brown in color, while common American squirrels are usually grey or black. Grey squirrels have been introduced into Europe (most notably, Great Britain). Grey squirrels cause problems to the red squirrel's population there. Red squirrels are protected in most of Europe. Squirrels have many predators or enemies. Foxes and raccoons eat squirrels. Hawks and owls also eat squirrels.
Life cycle.
Squirrels have sex in February and March in winter, and in June and July in summer. Females may become pregnant up to twice a year. Usually 4-6 young are born, after a gestation period (pregnancy) of around 39 days. Only the mother looks after the young, which are born completely helpless. Young squirrels are deaf and blind during the first few weeks of their life. In the wild, squirrels get about 3 years old. They usually become mature after two. In captivity, squirrels were observed to live for up to 10 years.
