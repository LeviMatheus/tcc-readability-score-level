Checkmate (sometimes called mate) is a when in chess a player's king is threatened with capture (in check) and there is no way to meet that threat. Or, simply put, the king is under attack and cannot avoid being captured. Giving checkmate is the biggest goal in chess: a player who is checkmated loses the game.
