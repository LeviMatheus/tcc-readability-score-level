Pearl Harbor is a naval base in the U.S. state of Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. Using this base, the U.S was able to have a good position on the advancing Japanese fleet. However, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, on December 7, 1941, which was a surprise. The attack led to America's fighting in World War II.
World War II was a war fought between the Allies and the Axis Powers. It was called a "World War" because many countries all over the world fought or helped in this war. Of all the wars ever fought, World War II involved the most countries and killed the most people. About 72 million people died, making it the worst man made disaster of all time. It lasted six years in Europe, from 1939 to 1945.
