Diprotodon was the largest marsupial that ever lived. Diprotodon superficially resembled a rhino without a horn. Its feet turned inwards like a wombatâ€™s, giving it a pigeon-toed appearance. It had strong claws on the front feet, so it may have been able to dig up roots to eat. Footprints of its hairy feet have been found, so we know it had fur like a horse rather than being bald like a rhino. Diprotodon is found in sites all over Australia, except in Tasmania.
