The common names of plants often vary from region to region, which is why most plant encyclopedias refer to plants using binomials, or "Latin" names. Common names are also referred to as "country names" or "farmer's names". These names develop over time according to use, appearance, and lore.
Most plants have several country names, and country names often refer to several distinct plants. This list includes garden plants as well as weeds.
This is by no means a complete list. Most of the common names here so far are regional names from North America.
