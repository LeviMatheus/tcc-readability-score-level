The Community of Christ is a Mormon movement. From 1872 to 2001, it was known as Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS). It was founded in the 1860s. It did not recognise Brigham Young as a Prophet, but instead followed Joseph Smith III, the son of the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith.

A number of court cases established this Church as the follower of law of the church established by Smith. for this reason it has the most manuscripts and the oldest Temple.

They see the Book of Mormon as a valid source of learning, but not as an additional revelation or scripture. Their baptism is therefore recognised as a valid Christian one.
