Saint Patrick's Day is the feast day of Saint Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. It is celebrated all over Ireland and everywhere in the world where Irish people or their descendants live. New York City has one of the biggest parades.
It is a very Irish festival and it involves a lot of feasting and celebrations, which includes traditional Irish music and eating corned beef and cabbage. Another tradition is you have to wear green clothing or you will be pinched.
