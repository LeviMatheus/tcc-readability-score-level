Johnston Atoll is an island in the Pacific Ocean. It is a property of the United States. The United States is currently trying to sell it. It is currently uninhabited, which means that there is nobody living on the island.
The island is named after Captain James Johnston, who discovered it in 1807. The island was mined for guano until 1890. After that, it was used as an army base.
Now, it is a wildlife refuge. That means people are not allowed to live on the island, only animals are.
