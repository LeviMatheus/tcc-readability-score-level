Silence was founded back in 1995 in Bavaria, Germany. Its founding members were Stefan Mueller (Guitar), Holger Kronester(Drums), and the brothers Bernd (Guitar) and Marco Wolf (Bass). From the beginning they played a mix of rock and metal, but always with a dark, depressive side.
The band's first successful record was Enola (e.g. "Album of the month" in German Metal-Hammer). It was released in 2000.
Three years later they recorded the p/o/u/r letters, a 8-track masterpiece, which received once again great reviews all over Germany and Europe.
In 2007 they released their 5-track e.p. the badtime stories, which made them become a record deal with the German label Biohazzard Records, a sublabel of Danse macabre.
The today's cast of the band is constant since 2003 and consists of Stefan Mueller (Vocals), Bernd Wolf (Guitar), Sebastian Koos (Keyboard), Christian Marsch (Guitar), Oliver Goess (Bass) and Bastian Mattlener (Drums).
