Udon is a type of thick wheat-based noodle popular in Japanese cuisine.
Udon is most often served hot as noodle soup in a mildly flavored broth. Its simplest form is called "kake udon". This is made of dashi, soy sauce (shōyu), and mirin. Different things can be put on top of the soup. These are called "toppings". Most often, thinly cut scallions are used. Other common toppings are tempura and shrimp.
The flavor of broth and topping vary from region to region. Usually, dark brown broth, made from dark soy sauce ("koikuchi shōyu") is used in eastern Japan. Light brown broth, made from light soy sauce ("usukuchi shōyu") is used in western Japan. This is even noticeable in packaged instant noodles, which are often sold in two different versions for east and west.
