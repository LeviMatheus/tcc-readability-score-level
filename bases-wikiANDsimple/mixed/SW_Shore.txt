A shore or shoreline is the fringe of land at the edge of a large body of water, such as an ocean, sea, or lake.
Shores are influenced by the topography of the surrounding landscape, as well as by erosion caused by water, such as waves. The geological makeup of rock and soil controls the type of shore which is created. Although a beach is a synonym for a shore, the term typically refers to shores which are sandy or pebbly, which can be produced by erosion of sedimentary soils.
A strict definition is the strip of land along a water body that is alternately exposed and covered by waves and tides.
