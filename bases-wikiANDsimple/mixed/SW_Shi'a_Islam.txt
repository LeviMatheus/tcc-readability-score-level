Shi'a Islam, also Shi'ism (Arabic:شيعة, Persian:شیعه) is a denomination of the Islamic faith. It is short for Shī'at 'Ali ("the party of 'Ali"). Shi'a Muslims believe in the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad and of his family whom they call the Ahl al-Bayt. The Shi'as think that the first three ruling Sunni caliphs had no importance to the development of the faith. The singular/adjective form is "Shī'ī " (شيعي.) and means a follower of the Household of Muhammad and of Ali ibn Abi Talib (Imam Ali).
Shi'a Islam, like Sunni Islam, has at times been divided into many branches, however only three of these have a significant number of followers nowadays. The best known and the one with most adherents is Twelvers ("Ithnāˤashariyya"), the others are Ismaili and Zaidiyyah. Alawites and Druzes call themselves Shi'as, but mainstream Shi'as do not agree on this.
