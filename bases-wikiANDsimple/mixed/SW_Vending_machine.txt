A Vending machine is a automatic machine that sells food such as canned soups and packaged sandwiches, snacks such as potato chips, chocolate bars, and candy); hot drinks (coffee, tea, and hot chocolate); cold drinks (juice, bottled water, soft drinks, and in some cases, milk or chocolate milk); or other items such as newspapers or cigarettes. Vending machines in bathrooms sometimes sell condoms, mouthwash, or toothpaste and toothbrushes.
How do vending machines work?
The machines usually work, when some money (usually coins) is put in a slot. Then, a button needs to be pushed, or a lever pulled. If there is enough money in the machine, the selected item will be dropped to a tray, where it can be taken out by the person making the purchase.
