Wrestling is a fight between two people without weapons, in which each person tries to beat their opponent. Wrestlers use clinching, holding, locking, and leverage. It resembles ritual fighting as it avoids things that will likely lead to serious injury. It is similar to military hand-to-hand combat or self-defence systems.
There are 3 main types of Wrestling. Freestyle, Greco-Roman, and Folkstyle. Folkstyle is mainly used in the U.S.
