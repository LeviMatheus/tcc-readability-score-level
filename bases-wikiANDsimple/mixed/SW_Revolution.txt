A Revolution is a very sharp change made to something. The word comes from Latin, and is related to the word "revolve" (which means "to turn around").
Revolutions are usually political in their nature. Some people feel unhappy with their lives. They might join together, share their ideas, and make a revolution. Often, revolutions include fighting, and civil unrest. But there are also revolutions that happen without fighting.
The Soviet Union fell apart into its different republics without much fighting in 1990. But in the French Revolution (1789), there was much bloodshed. The years right after this Revolution in France are often called the Reign of Terror.
The term RPM stands for "revolutions per minute". It tells how many times a disc (usually a Compact disc, DVD or vinyl disc turns around in one minute.
