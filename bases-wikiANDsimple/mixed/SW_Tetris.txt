"Tetris" is a video game where the goal is to drop blocks, called tetriminoes, down into a playing field to make lines. Tetriminoes are made of four connected squares each, and there are seven different shapes of tetriminoes. A player uses the tetrominoes to make unbroken lines of squares across the bin from left to right by stacking them in the playing field. When a player makes a line, it clears. After a clear, squares over that line fall. As play goes on, the tetrominoes fall faster. A player loses when the tetrominoes make it to the top of the playing field.
Tetris has appeared in many video game systems. It has become very common from back when Alexey Pazhitnov first made it in 1985.
