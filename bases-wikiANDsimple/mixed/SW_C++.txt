C++ (pronounced "see plus plus") is a computer programming language. It has been created for writing programs for many different purposes. In the 1990s, C++ became one of the most used programming languages.
The C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in the 1980s.
It was originally named "C with classes". The language was planned as a better version of the
C programming language and it added features like object-oriented programming. Step by
step, a lot of advanced features were added to the language, like operator overloading,
exception handling and templates.
The name can be explained like this: In C and C++, the command "x"++ adds 1 to the value of "x". So the name C++ is a play on that, because of the enhancements made to C.
Example.
The following text is C++ source code and it will write the words "Hello World!" to the screen when it has been compiled and is executed.
It is an object oriented programming language. Actually it is the object oriented extension of C, another programming language. Today this language is used to write mainly system programs and also application programs.
C++ is faster than Java, which is a pure object oriented programming language. But Java is easier to code than C++.
