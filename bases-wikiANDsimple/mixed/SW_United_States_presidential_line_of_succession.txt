If the current President of the United States dies or is unable to do his job, the U.S. Constitution says that the Vice President of the United States becomes President. However, if both the President and the Vice-President die or are unable to do their jobs, there is a list that says who is to become President. For example, if the President, Vice-President, Speaker of the House, and President Pro Tempore of the Senate died, then the current Secretary of State would be the new President.
Notes.
â€  The U.S. Constitution says that only people born in the United States can be President. However, some people in this list were born in other countries. Because of this, they are not allowed to become President even if they are next in line. Right now, Secretary Gutierrez and Secretary Chao were not born in the United States, so they cannot become President. If everyone from the President to the Secretary of Agriculture died, they would be skipped and Mike Levitt would be President.
