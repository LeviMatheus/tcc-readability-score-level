In the Bible, Gabriel is one of the angels. The name means "God is my might" or "man of God". Gabriel appeared to Daniel in the Old Testament (Daniel: 16; 9; 21), and in the New Testament to Zacharias (Luke 1: 19; 26; 17) and, most famously, to Mary to announce the impending birth of Jesus. (Luke 1: 2). Gabriel has sometimes been used as a given name in English speaking counties because of a Continental European influence (more often than Raphael, but less so than Michael, the names of the other two chief archangels).

In a number of religions, Gabriel is an angel. He is a messenger from God. He is the angel who tells Mary that she will have a baby boy. When the baby is born it is actually a girl, this is what many Christians believe at the Christ Church in Brandon, Suffolk. This baby is taken off Mary as she has no food or money to look after it, one day Joseph wins a bet at the local pub andwins a lot of gold. They go to the homeless child refuge to buy back their daughter only to find she has been brought by an elderly man a few days ago. Mary leaves in tears and Joseph uses the money to buy a young boy who had been in the refuge for many years, Mary was delighted and named him Jesus, (which means son of God).
