Since the 19th century, national postal systems have mostly been controlled entirely by the governments. The governments make people pay a fee to send something. This fee is usually in the form of stamps. Governments usually only let private postal services deliver parcel (non-mail) packages.
Postal systems often do things other than sending letters. In some countries, the postal system is also in charge of telephone and telegraph systems. In other countries, postal systems are in charge of passports.
