Mount Cotopaxi is a volcano in Ecuador. The mountain's altitude (height) is 5911m. That is high enough for snow to fall on it, even though it is near the equator (a very warm part of the world). If the volcano erupted, it would be very bad for the people living around it because of the destruction and damage it could cause.
