Presbyterianism is a kind of Protestant Christianity. It was started off in Scotland by John Knox. Today there are Presbyterian churches across the world.
Presbyterians (followers of Presbyterianism) believe that the Bible is the most important thing in their church and that no one can change the meaning of it. They believe that God has control over everything and that only followers of Jesus Christ may get into heaven.
Presbyterian churches are led by men called "elders." Many Presbyterian churches have women as elders, too.
