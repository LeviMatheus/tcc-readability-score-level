Manchuria is the homeland of the Manchu people (related to Chinese and Mongolians). This place is in north-east China. Parts of Manchuria were annexed by the Russian Empire so they are now ruled by Russia.
Manchuria is a translation of the Chinese word Manzhou (Chinese language: 滿洲,Mǎnzhōu).
History.
In the early history, Manchuria was under the control of many Chinese kingdoms. Later, the Manchu people formed their own empire called Jurchen. They eventually invaded China and founded the Chinese Qing Dynasty.
Although China signed a treaty with Russia, the Russians took advantage of the weak Qing government and annexed the part that touches the Pacific Ocean. Japan then attacked the Russians to get this important piece of land. Later, Japan invaded the Chinese part of Manchuria too (see Manchukuo). This eventually lead to World War II.
After the war, Manchuria was returned to China and Russia.
Geography.
