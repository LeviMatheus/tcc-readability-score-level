A transposon is a gene or series of DNA code that can move around inside the cells genome. Transposons were first found by Barbara McClintock while working on maize. She received a Nobel Prize for this in 1983. Transposons will usually mutations in the genetic code. This can cause death or serious disease. Medical problems believed to be caused by transposon include hemophilia A and B, porphyria, increased chance to get cancer, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Transposons can be used to put a gene into the DNA of an organism. This has been done with fruit flies ("Drosophila melanogaster") by putting the transposon into the embryo. The orgins of transposons is a topic in science that is being researched. Not much information is known about them.
