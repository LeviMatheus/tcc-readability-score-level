"Kamikaze" (Japanese: 神風; literally: "god-wind"; usual translation: "divine wind") is a word of Japanese origin. It comes from the name the Japanese gave to a typhoon that destroyed the Mongol fleet in the 13th century and saved the country from invasion.
In Western culture, the word "kamikaze" is used to mean the suicide pilots of the Empire of Japan, and their attacks on the ships of the Allied Powers in the final years of World War II. It has also come to mean other kinds of suicide attack.
Most people in Western culture believe the word "kamikaze" was the name used by the Japanese military for pilots, but that isn't true. Their correct name was "tokubetsu kōgeki tai" (特別攻撃隊), which literally means "special attack unit." This is usually said "tokkōtai" (特攻隊) in a shortened form. The suicide attacks made by Navy pilots were called "shinpū tokubetsu kōgeki tai" (神風特別攻撃隊, "divine wind special attack units"). The American translators used a different style of pronunciation of the Japanese language by mistake, and read the word "shinpū" ("divine wind") as "kamikaze". The name became popular throughout the world, and after the war, the Japanese also started using it.
