The can-can (also spelled "cancan" or "Can Can") is a music hall dance, performed by a chorus line of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts, petticoats, and black stockings, like the fashions of the 1890s.
The Galop from Jacques Offenbach's "Orpheus in the Underworld" is the tune most often played with the can-can (and a more evolved one).
