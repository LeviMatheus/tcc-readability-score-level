97 Klotho is a fairly big main belt asteroid. While it is an M-type, its radar albedo is too low to allow it to be made of nickel-iron. Klotho is similar to 21 Lutetia and 22 Kalliope in that all three are M-types made up of stuff unknown. Klotho was found by Ernst Tempel on February 17, 1868. It was the fifth and last asteroid he found. It is named after one of the three Moirae, or Fates, in Greek mythology.
