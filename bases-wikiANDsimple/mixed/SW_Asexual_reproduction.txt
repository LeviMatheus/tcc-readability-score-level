Asexual reproduction is also known as "agamogenesis". It is a special form of reproduction, where only one parent is needed to make an identical copy of itself. The main process governing asexual reproduction is Mitosis. This type of reproduction is common among simple single-cell creatures, for example, a amoeba. Many plants also reproduce asexually.
Binary Fission.
Some organisms like Bacteria reproduce using Binary Fission, it is when they split in two, so one bacteria becomes two bacteria. This always leads to daughter cells, never male cells and the offspring will always be identical to the parent.
Budding.
Budding is a something, for example, similar to Binary Fisson, but it is used by plants and some animals. It is when a small part of a plant or animal break off and then, while they are separated from their "mother", they start to grow until both the "parent" and the "offspring" are the same size and both are capable of budding again. This will happen many more times
Spores.
Fungi (for example, mushrooms) produce spores, which inside them have the genetic material to make a whole new organism idential to it's parent. It's like budding, but with gametes rather than original parts of the organism.
