Limited government is a form of government with roles and powers given, limited, and limited by law, usually in a written constitution. A limited government has only the powers that the people give it.
Related to this idea is "small government" – a system that put most of its power in smaller groups, such as private businesses and its own citizens. On the other hand, “big government” involves a great amount of intervention by the state.
In Britain, the idea of limited government is part of the political tradition and is not written into the British Constitution. However, in the United States, the idea of limited government is written into the Constitution.
