Neuroscience is the scientific study of brain and mind and the whole nervous system. It helps to understand how we perceive and interact with the outside world and, in particular, how human experience and human biology influence each other.
Its studies may include genetics, biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and pathology of the nervous system. Traditionally it is seen as a branch of biological sciences. However, recently there has been an effort to draw together many related areas, including psychology, computer science, statistics, physics, and medicine.
Major Branches of Neuroscience.
Current neuroscience research activities can be very roughly divided into the following major branches, based on what they study and at what scale they study, as well as what experimental approaches they use. Individual neuroscientists, however, often work on questions that span several different subfields.
Major Themes of Research.
Neuroscience research from different areas can also be seen as focusing on a set of specific themes and questions. (Some of these are taken from http://www.northwestern.edu/nuin/fac/index.htm)
