Fir Park is a football stadium in Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. The stadium is the home of Scottish Premier League club Motherwell F.C.. The stadium is all seats with a capacity of 13,742. The record attendance for the stadium is 35,632 against Rangers in a 1952 Scottish Cup match.
Today, the stadium has an unbalanced look, with one large stand aside three smaller stands. The biggest stand at the ground is the "South Stand", a massive two-tiered structure which was built in 1993. Opposite is the comparatively small "Davie Cooper Stand", named after the former player, which was built in 1995. These two stands have their advertising slogans changed whenever the club's sponsor changes.
Running along one side of the ground is the "East Stand", a former terrace which was converted into a seating area. This stand is highly distinctive in that it has the legendary "KEEP CIGARETTES AWAY FROM THE MATCH" slogan displayed below the roof, facing the pitch. Since the introduction of the smoking ban in 2006, slogans such as these are no longer needed. This stand is the stand of choice for many of the younger and more vocal fans.
Opposite the "East Stand" is the "The Phil O'Donnell Stand", which was previously known as the "Main Stand". The stand was renamed "The Phil O'Donnell Stand" in honour of the late Motherwell captain who died on the Fir Park pitch.
It is an unusual structure in that the steel girders run for the full length of the pitch, but the stand only runs for two thirds the length of the pitch. This was due to a dispute with a home owner beside the stadium during construction, which the club lost, and thus were unable to complete the stand across the whole length of the pitch.
Gretna.
During the 2007-08 season, Gretna F.C. rented Fir Park from Motherwell and played all but one of their home league games there.
