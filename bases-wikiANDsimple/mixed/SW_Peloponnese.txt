The Peloponnese is a large peninsula in Greece. It is the part of Greece which is south of the Isthmus of Corinth.
The island of Peloponnese has lots of mountains and coasts, with the highest part being Mount Killini.
There are four south-pointing penisulas within the Peloponnese. They are called Messenia, the Mani Peninsula, Epidaurus, and the Argolid.
There are also two groups of islands near the Peloponese. In the east there are the Argo-Saronic Islands and in the west there are the Ionian Islands. There is also the island of Kythira, which is near to the Epidaurus penisula. The Kythira is often thought of as part of the Ionian Islands.
The Peloponnese has had people living on it since prehistoric times. Its name means "Island of the People" and was named after Pelops. Pelops was a person from Greek mythology, who took over the island. During the Middle Ages the peninsula was known as the Morea.
