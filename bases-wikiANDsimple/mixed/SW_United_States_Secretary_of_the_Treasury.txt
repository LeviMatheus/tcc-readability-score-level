Note: Robert Morris was the first person appointed Secretary of the Treasury by George Washington, but Morris declined this office; thus the 1st Secretary of the Treasury was Alexander Hamilton - appointed at Morris's suggestion.

From Morris's 1784 resignation until 1789, the young union's finances were overseen by a three-member Treasury Board.
