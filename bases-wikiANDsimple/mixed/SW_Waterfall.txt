A waterfall is where there is a sharp fall of water found on a river or stream. The water flows from higher land, then it falls down a big step of rock to lower land where it will continue on its journey.
Many people choose them as sacred spots.
The roar from the falling water is very loud and the sound makes beautiful music.
Many people love the serenity and peacefulness of them.
One of the biggest waterfalls in the world is "Angel Falls" (in Colombia) and it is one of the best places in the world to go and see. Most people find them very beautiful and inspiring.
