Ophthalmosaurus was an ichthyosaur of the Late Jurassic period (165 to 150 million years ago), named for its extremely large eyes. Several beautifully preserved skeletons, ranging in age from juveniles to adults. Remains have been found in Europe and Argentina.
It had the largest eyes of any vertebrate, which helped it hunt for squid at night or at great depth. Its snout was long and thin, perfect for snapping after fast, maneuverable prey.
