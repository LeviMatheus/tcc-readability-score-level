Ribosome is a part of a cell that creates protein. A ribosome is a protein that starts its formation in the nucleolus of a cell. The nucleolus is found in the center of the nucleus. The nucleus is protected by the nuclear envelope,and lets things out through the nuclear pores. The ribosome is made of RNA and proteins. The job of the ribosome is to make new proteins. They are usually found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, but can also be found through out the cytoplasm.
The ribosome is the most important cell organelle that is present in all cells from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.
