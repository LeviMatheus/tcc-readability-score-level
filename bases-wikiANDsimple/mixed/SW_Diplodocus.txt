"Diplodocus" was a huge dinosaur from the same time as the "Allosaurus". It lived during the Jurassic Period, about 145 to 155 million years ago. It was a vegetarian, meaning it ate no meat.
Size.
The Diplodocus was a long-necked, whip-tailed giant and could grow up to 27 m long. It had an 8 m long neck and 14 m long tail. Its weight was approximately 22,680 kg. It had a short 6 ft long head. Its size helped protect it from other dinosaurs. It used its long neck to poke into forests because itâ€™s body was too big. It is also believed to have knocked the trees down.
Fossils.
Diplodocus skeletons are among the longest dinosaur skeletons ever found. Fossils were discovered in Western North America, particularly in the Rocky Mountains of the western USA. A complete tail has never been found.
Seismosaurus.
Seismosaurus ("Seismosaurus hallorum") was thought to be its own species of dinosaur. In 2004 and 2006 it was decided to be a large species of Diplodocus. It is now known as "Diplodocus hallorum".
