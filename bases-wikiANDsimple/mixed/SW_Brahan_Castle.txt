Brahan Castle was a castle that used to stand near Dingwall, in Easter Ross, Scotland. The castle belonged to the chiefs of the Clan Mackenzie who ruled the area. The Jacobite risings as well as religious struggles all took place around the castle. The castle was also the place where the Jacobite Mackenzies became the first defeated clan who were forced to surrender and be ruled by the English. The building was demolished in 1951.
