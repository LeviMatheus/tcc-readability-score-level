Agapanthus africanus (African lily) is a flowering plant from the genus "Agapanthus" found only on rocky sandstone slopes of the winter rainfall Fynbos from the Cape Peninsula to Swellendam. The name "A. africanus" has long been misapplied to "A. praecox" in horticultural use and publications across the world, and horticultural plants sold as "A. africanus" are actually hybrids or cultivars of "A. praecox".
The plant is a rhizomatous evergreen geophyte from in height. Leaves are suberect and strap shaped. Flowers are broadly funnel-shaped, deep blue, and thick-textured, each flower long, flowering from midsummer (December to April in the Southern Hemisphere habitat) mainly after fire.
Cultivation.
Unlike the more common "A. praecox", it is not suitable as a garden plant, requiring hot, dry summers, and winter rainfall climate. It will not tolerate extended freezing temperatures.
