Spyware is a category of software for computers. Spyware is software that collects some data, usually without the computer users' knowledge. Very often, this data is then sent over the internet to a third party, which can use it for something. Very often, this is used for marketing. But spyware can also be used to get data from computers that they should not know. It can be used as a keylogger which can see what you are typing into the internet. Keyloggers can steal important information like passwords that you type. The best protection is to get a program that protects against spyware. But be careful, many websites that claim to have them are actually spyware not something to protect against it.
