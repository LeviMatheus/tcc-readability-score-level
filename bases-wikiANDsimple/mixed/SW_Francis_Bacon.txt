Sir Francis Bacon KC was an English philosopher, statesman, and author. He was knighted in 1603. He was made Baron Verulam in 1618, and Viscount St Albans in 1621. Because he didn't have children both titles ended when he died.
He was born on 22 January 1561 and died on 9 April 1626.
His first job was a lawyer. He became best known as a leading thinker in new ways of looking at the world. His writings started and made famous a way of thinking about science. This way of thinking is now called the "Baconian method". It is based on looking at the world by making experiments. After watching the results the scientist comes up with an idea to explain what has happened. This idea or hypothesis is then further tested by experiments. This way of thinking about science is called inductive methodology. In Bacon's time these methods were linked with magic including hermeticism and alchemy. Alchemy was the study of fire, earth, water and air. Alchemists tried to make gold from lead.
