"Einstein on the Beach" is an opera written by the minimalist composer Philip Glass and theater director and designer Robert Wilson. It was first acted for an audience in Avignon, France in 1976. It is a single act opera, approximately five hours long with no intermission. Given the minimalist (repetitive) nature of the music, audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish.
