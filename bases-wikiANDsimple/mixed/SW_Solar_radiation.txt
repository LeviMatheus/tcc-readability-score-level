Solar radiation is the energy given off by the sun in all directions. When this energy reaches the earth's surface, it is called insolation.
Solar radiation gives out light and heat to the earth in the form of electromagnetic waves. It has different wave lengths. Radiation such as ultraviolet radiation, X rays and visible light have short wave lengths. Infrared radiation has a long wave length.
Solar radiation is measured with a pyranometer or pyrheliometer.
The atmosphere affects the amount of solar radiation received. When solar radiation travels through the atmosphere, some of it is absorbed by the atmosphere(16%). Some of it is scattered to space (6%). Some of it is reflected by clouds (28%). About 47% of it reaches the earth's surface.
