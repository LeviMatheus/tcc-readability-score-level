Polyps are one of two forms of some animal species. Usually polyps are asexual. The other such form is the medusa. When medusae mate, the result will be polyps, when polyps replicate (they don't have sex), the result will be medusas. Certain animal species are polyps all the time.
Both forms live in water.
