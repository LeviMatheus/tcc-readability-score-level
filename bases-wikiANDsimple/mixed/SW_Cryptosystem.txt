There are two different meanings of the word cryptosystem.
General meaning.
In this meaning, the term cryptosystem is used as shorthand, or as an abbreviation for "cryptographic system". A cryptographic system is any computer system that involves cryptography. Such systems include for instance, a system for secure electronic mail which might include methods for digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, key management techniques, and so on.
Meaning in the cryptographic community.
In this meaning, a cryptosystem refers to a set of algorithms needed to implement a method of encryption and decryption.
The term "cipher" (sometimes "cypher") is often used to refer to a pair of (encryption/decryption) algorithms. Therefore, the term "cryptosystem" is most often used when the key generation algorithm is important. For this reason, the term "cryptosystem" is commonly used to refer to public key techniques; however both "cipher" and "cryptosystem" are used for symmetric key techniques.
"Cryptographic system" vs. "cryptosystem".
The "Internet Security Glossary" RFC 2828 advises against using the term "cryptosystem", giving the following definitions.
