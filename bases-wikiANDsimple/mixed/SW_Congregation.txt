A congregation is a group of people who have come together (congregated) for something, usually for religious worship. In Christian churches the word “congregation” is often used to mean all the people in the main part of the church, but not the choir or the priests. For example: the order of service might say that the choir will sing verse 1 of a carol and "the congregation are asked to join in at verse 2".
