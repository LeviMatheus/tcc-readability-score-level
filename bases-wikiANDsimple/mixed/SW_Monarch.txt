A monarch is a ruler who rules becuase his parents ruled. A male monarch is called a king. A female monarch is called a queen. Some monarchs are called emperors or "empress"es.
Monarchs were very common in history. A lot of countries used to have a monarch, but no longer have them. They are now republics. Some countries that still have monarchs have other leaders that actually have the power. These are called constitutional monarchies.
