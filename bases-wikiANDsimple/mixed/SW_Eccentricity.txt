In popular use, eccentricity or extravagance refers to unusual or odd behavior on the part of an individual. This behavior would typically be perceived as unusual or unnecessary. Eccentricity is contrasted with "normal" behavior, the nearly universal means by which individuals in society solve given problems and act in everyday life. Eccentric behavior may be good, or malicious. Spending a lot of money in nonsensical things, for example, is usually seen as eccentricity. Sometimes, it can be associated with genius; others, with madness. Albert Einstein and Nero, for example, were both eccentrics, but of very different type.
