"Check on It" is an R&B song written by Beyoncé Knowles, Kasseem Dean, Sean Garrett, Angela Beyincé, and Stayve Thomas for the soundtrack to the 2006 film "The Pink Panther", in which Beyoncé co-stars. Although not included on its soundtrack album (because it only contains the films scores), the song is included on Destiny's Child's greatest hits album "1's" and on selected non-U.S. versions of Knowles' second studio album, "B’Day". It was produced by Knowles and Swizz Beatz.
Music video.
When demand was growing for the song, Knowles shot a music video serving as promotion for both "#1's" and "The Pink Panther". The video was directed by Hype Williams, and was premiered on December 16 2005. The remix of the song in the music video features a remix of "The Pink Panther Theme" and a rap from Bun B. The video has a pink theme, with Knowles shown in mostly all pink (to fit in with "The Pink Panther"), and the dancers wear pink PVC jackets and dance around rippling pink satin sheets. The video cuts to Knowles wearing a pink polka dot corset against a hot magenta polka dot wall. Where black bars normally appear on a (full screen) television showing a widescreen production, footage is displayed of pink curtains moving in the background.
"Check on It" won the 2006 MTV Video Music Award for "Best R&B Video" on August 31, 2006.
