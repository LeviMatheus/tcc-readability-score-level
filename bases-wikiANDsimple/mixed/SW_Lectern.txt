A lectern (from the Latin "lectus", past participle of "legere", "to read") is a reading desk with a slanted top. It is usually placed on a stand some other form of support. Documents or books are often put on top of a lectern to make it easier for someone to read them to other people. For example, for Scripture reading, lectures, speechs or sermons. The height and slant of a lectern can usually be changed to so the person reading can stand properly and make good eye-contact with an audience.
