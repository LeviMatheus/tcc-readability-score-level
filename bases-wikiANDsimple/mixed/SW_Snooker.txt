Snooker is a billiards sport for two players. It is played on a large (12' Ã— 6') table that is covered with baize and has pockets in each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. The players use cues to strike the white ball (the cue ball). There are 15 red balls (worth 1 point each) and 6 colours: a yellow (2 points), green (3 points), brown (4 points), blue (5 points), pink (6 points) and black ball (7 points).
The player that scores more points wins the frame. A match consists of an agreed number of frames.
