Hesiod ("Hesiodos",), was an Ancient Greek poet and rhapsode. He presumably lived around 700 BC in Askra? in Boeotia, as a farmer. Today his writings are one of the main sources for Greek mythology, and everyday life in Ancient Greece, such as farming techniques, astronomy and ancient time-keeping.
