The word "error" can mean different things. In Latin, "error" means "wondering" or "going away", but it is used more often to mean "mistake".
In Statistics.
An error is the difference between a number that someone thought was true, and the number that someone actually saw.
Computer programming.
The word error can be used to describe a computer program that was not written in the right way. A "syntax error" is a bit of source code that does not make sense to the computer. A "logic error" is a mistake in the algorithm used, which might result in problems with the output.
An error may also be an "exception", which is something that happens unexpectedly. For example, it is an error to try to write more files onto a disk that is full. Careful programmers write code that can deal with errors that may happen; they can do this by labelling each error with an error code and using exception handling. Continuing to run a program when an error has not been dealt with can cause error avalanche, which means errors pile up and behaviour becomes more difficult to predict.
