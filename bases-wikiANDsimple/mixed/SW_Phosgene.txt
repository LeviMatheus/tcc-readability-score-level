Phosgene is the chemical compound with the formula COCl2. This gas has no color. The gas is used as a weapon during World War I, but it is also a valuable tool used for organic synthesis. When there is a small amount in the air, the smell will be freshly cut hay or grass. Some soldiers during the First World War have stated that it smelled a little like May Blossom. When chlorine is burned, small amounts are released from the breakdown of chlorinated compounds.
Safety.
Phosgene is a strong poison as the smell may not be noticed and signs may be slow to be noticed.
Phosgene can be seen at 0.4 parts per million,
which is four times the safe amount.
Its high ability to poison doesn't come from the hydrogen chloride released
by a process. Instead, it comes from the action of the phosgene on the proteins in the pulmonary sac of the lungs. The sacs are where the oxygen goes into the body, and their damage makes it hard for the blood and air move oxygen and carbon. This will make breathing very hard. Badges are worn by those at risk of exposure.
Sodium bicarbonate may be used to make harmless spills of phosgene. Gas spills may be made harmless with a special liquid spray.
