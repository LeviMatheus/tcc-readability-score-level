Grace Kelly (November 12, 1929 - September 14, 1982) is an American actress. She later married Prince Rainier III of Monaco and became Her Serene Highness The Princess of Monaco. With Prince Rainier III, they had 3 children. Hereditary Princess Caroline Louise Marguerite, born January 23, 1957, and now heiress presumptive to the throne of Monaco, Albert II, Prince of Monaco, born March 14, 1958, and Princess St√©phanie Marie Elisabeth, born February 1, 1965. A few of her films included 3 Hitchock films, Alfred Hitchcock: Dial M for Murder, Rear Window, and To Catch a Thief. In 1955 she won an Academy Award for the Country Girl. She was the first actress to appear on a postage stamp. She was also mentioned in Billy Joel's song "We didn't start the fire" and in Mika's song "Grace Kelly" (2007). The classic head-cover of a silk scarf crossed under the chin and knotted at the side or nape of the neck is universally known as the "Grace Kelly." This chic look is still copied by many female Hollywood stars when they wish to retain a degree of anonymity in the public eye.
