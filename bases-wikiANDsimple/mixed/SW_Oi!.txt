Oi! also called Street punk, is a type of punk rock that was started in the United Kingdom. The people that started it wanted to connect punk with a working class street-level following. The Oi! genre began in the latter part of the 1970s. Oi! is a mixing of the styles of early punk bands, for example The Clash, early British rock (i.e. the Rolling Stones), football chants, and glam rock bands
