The endogenetic processes are the processes that shape the land by forces coming from within the earth (endogenetic forces).
There are 3 main endogenetic processes: folding, faulting and vulcanicity. They take place mainly along the plate boundaries, which are the zones that are not stable. Endogenetic processes cause many major landform features.
