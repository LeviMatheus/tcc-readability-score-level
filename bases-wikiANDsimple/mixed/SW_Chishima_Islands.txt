The Chishima Islands(Ja: 千島列島 Ru: Kuril Islands）are a group of islands (archipelago) between Russia and Japan. The northern islands are a part of Russia and the southern islands are a part of Japan. Both countries say that they own four of the islands in the middle of the group.
Japan is asking for return of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and Habomai shoto. They say that these islands are being illegally held by Russia. Several political parties in Japan are asking for return of all Chishima Islands. Russia has said that it would return Shikotan and Habomai shoto in 1956 but Japan did not agree to this agreement because it would mean the United States would keep the island of Okinawa.
