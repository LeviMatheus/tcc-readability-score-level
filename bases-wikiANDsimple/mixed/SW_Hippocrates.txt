Hippocrates was a Greek doctor. He was probably born in 460 BC, and died in 377 BC.
Hippocrates is called the "father of medicine". He was the first person to write that people got sick for scientific reasons. People used to believe disease was caused by angry (mad) gods.
Hippocrates wrote about treating sick people. His writings are still important to doctors today. He said many ideas that doctors still study. An idea he wrote about is "patient confidentiality". This means that doctors cannot tell anyone else what their patients tell them. Another idea is that the doctor cannot do anything to kill a patient. These kinds of ideas are part of medical ethics.
The "Hippocratic Oath" is named after him. This is a promise or "oath" doctors say. This means they say they will do what is said in the "Hippocratic Oath". (People now think that Hippocrates did not write it.)
Most medical schools today use a new "version". This means that some things are changed. But the important ideas are the same.
This is an example of a modern "Hippocratic Oath". This is used today at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.
