"The Seven Samurai" is an important Japanese movie, written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, released in 1954. The samurai need to protect a town from thiefs, but they each do it for a different reason. It was later remade in America as a western called "The Magnificent Seven".
The movie was also adapted into an Japanese anime series in 2004 by GONZO, entitled Samurai 7. The anime series takes a more futuristic and fantasy take at the original story, replacing robots for thiefs and bestowing superhuman abilities to the 7 samurais.
