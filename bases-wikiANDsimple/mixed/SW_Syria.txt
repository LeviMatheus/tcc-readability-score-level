History.
Syria has a very long history. It was a land of Phoenicians. Later it became a part of the Roman Empire and then the East Roman Empire. In those days people spoke the Syrian language. The city Antioche was great and one of the important cities in the world of Christianity. It was conquered by Muslims and most of the people changed their faith from Christianity to Islam. People began to speak the Arabic language. Today most Syrian people believe in Islam but there are Christians too.
Syria was part of the Arab League with Egypt once. Syria had some wars with Israel and some territories like the Golan Plateau were occupied by Israel.
