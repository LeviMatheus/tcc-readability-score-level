A protectorate is a country, or part of a country, or maybe a tribe of people in one area, that is ruled by another, larger and stronger country based on an agreement between the protectorate and the strong country. These were very common in the 1800s, especially in Africa, when European countries would give protection to small states or places there, and make money with the goods of the African place in exchange.
