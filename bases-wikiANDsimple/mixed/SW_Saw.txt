A saw is a tool used to cut things.
There are many kinds of saw. Some of them are hand tools that work with muscle power, like the saw in the picture. Some saws have other sources of power and are very powerful, such as a chainsaw that is used to cut down trees.
The work carried out with a saw is usually noisy. Using a saw to cut materials is dangerous because of sharp edges and care must be taken not to let sharp edges touch the skin. Parts of the material being cut can fly off the work and become a hazard to breathing, to eyes and to the skin.
