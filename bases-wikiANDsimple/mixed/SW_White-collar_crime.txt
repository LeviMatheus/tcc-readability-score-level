White-collar crime refers to crimes committed by high-ranking officials, nobles and people of high status.
Noble warriors, especially young bachelor knights who were not assigned any tasks, were often involved in it, which is also known as "fur-colar crime".
It is the commission of theft, plunder, and pillage because they were bored and out of money.
Being members of the nobility, crimes committed against a helpless peasantry often went unpunished during the 15th century in Western Europe.
