Five were a British boy band made in 1997 by the same team that formed the Spice Girls, Bob Herbert and his son Chris. Signed by Simon Cowell, they enjoyed fair success worldwide, but particularly in the UK, parts of Europe, Russia, parts of Asia, Brazil, Israel, Australia, New Zealand and USA. They broke up on September 27, 2001, after selling almost 20 million records, and having 11 top ten singles and 4 top ten albums in the UK. The five members were Scott Robinson, Ritchie Neville, Jason 'J' Brown, Richard 'Abs' Breen and Sean Conlon. Four of the five original members briefly reformed the group on September 27, 2006, but only 7 months after announcing a comeback, Five made an announcement by their official website they would again disband.
