The Royal College of St. Peter in Westminster, almost always known as Westminster School, is one of Britain's leading private schools, with one of the highest number of students going to Oxford or Cambridge Universities of any secondary school or college. Located in within of Westminster Abbey in central London, and with a history going back before the 12th century, the school's notable ex-students include Ben Jonson, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, Jeremy Bentham, and A. A. Milne. Boys enter the Westminster Under School when they are seven years old, and to the main school when they are thirteen. Girls are allowed only at sixteen. The school has around 750 pupils; around a third are boarders (who live in the school), of whom most go home for the weekends, after Saturday morning school.
