Live Aid was a charity rock concert that took place in more than one stadium. It was held on July 13, 1985. It was organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for Africa, whose citizens were not getting enough food. Live Aid was held in two places at the same time: Wembley Stadium in London, and John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia. The concert raised over $280 million.
In 2004, Live Aid was released on DVD so people can watch it at home. The money used to buy the DVD set was given to Africa.
