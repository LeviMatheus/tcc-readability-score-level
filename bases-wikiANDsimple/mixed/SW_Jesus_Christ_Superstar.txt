Jesus Christ Superstar is a musical by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. It was originally an album, starring Ian Gillan, Murray Head, and Yvonne Elliman, before it became a major Broadway play, and then a movie starring Ted Neeley and Carl Anderson. It is notable for its portrayal of Judas Iscariot in a more positive light than in the Bible, and also showing the relationships of the different characters.
