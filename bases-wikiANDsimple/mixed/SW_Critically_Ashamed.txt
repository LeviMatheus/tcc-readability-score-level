Critically Ashamed is the sophomore effort by Fm static, a canadian pop punk band, like I've said before LOL.
Below are a few songs I'd like to mention
Waste of time.
Waste of time was a main single from this album. It's about how God has pushed trevor mcnevan through the shadows of his life (trevor explained this on one of his myspace blogs for fm static)
Tonight.
Tonight is the acoustic (well, sort of) ballad that you find on pop punk albums. It was written about trevors brother who died at an early age. He remembers the times they had and is thinking about what would be happening, had his brother still been alive.
Hope the rock show goes good.
The above title is a short song, an intro to the album, where trevors nephew is wishing him look for his concert.
The next big thing.
The next big thing is this fun-sounding song with a huge warning. To convince people you are good, you almost have to tell yourself your the best. New artists buy into that, and its unfortunate.
