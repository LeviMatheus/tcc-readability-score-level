Hollywood Pictures is one of The Walt Disney Company's movie companies. It makes movies for a more adult audience than Walt Disney Pictures. The first made by Hollywood Pictures was Arachnophobia in 1990.
The man in charge of Disney, Michael Eisner, wanted Hollywood Pictures to be a complete studio in the same way that Touchstone was. This did not happen. In recent years the company has done less work and its management was made a part of Walt Disney Pictures. Its most profitable movie is The Sixth Sense. This movie earned over $200 million at the North American box office.
Disney stopped using the company in 2001. It started the company again in 2006 when it released the horror movie Stay Alive.
