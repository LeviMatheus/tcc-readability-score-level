61 Danaë is a quite big, rocky Main belt asteroid. It was found by H. Goldschmidt on September 9, 1860 and named after Danaë, the mother of Perseus in Greek mythology.
A moon has been suggested in 1985 based on lightcurve data. The primary's ellipsoid is then 85×80×75 km, and 101 km away would be the moon, measuring 55×30×30 km. The density of both would be 1.1 g/cm³.
