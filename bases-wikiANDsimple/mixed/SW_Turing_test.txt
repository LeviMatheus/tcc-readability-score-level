The Turing test is a test to see if a computer can trick a person into believing that the computer is a person too. Alan Turing thought that if a human couldn't tell the difference between another human and the computer, then that computer must be as intelligent as a human.
Test setup.
A person has a telegraph, and is connected to two communication partners. One of the two correspondents is a machine. The person can ask anything, with the telegraph. If the person cannot tell which of the two is the machine more than 50% of the time, then the machine is said to be "intelligent" (or smart).
Later on, people narrowed down the test. A human is unlikely to know everything. Therefore, both the human and the machine would be specialists in some field of knowledge. So would the person asking.
As of 2006, no computer has passed the Turing test as such.
