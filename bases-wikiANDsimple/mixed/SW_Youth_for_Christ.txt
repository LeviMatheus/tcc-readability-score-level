Youth for Christ (YFC) is an international Christian ministry that promotes youth evangelism and biblical Christianity. In the early 1940s, during World War II, many young men, mostly ministers and evangelists, were holding large rallies in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. In an effort to coordinate these programs Youth for Christ was started in 1944. The organization was co-founded by the Rev. Billy Graham and then-evangelist Charles Templeton.
