The equator is a line which is not real drawn around a planet, such as our Earth. It is one of the lines known as a line of latitude, or circle of latitude.
The equator is halfway between the North Pole and the South Pole. There, the surface of the planet is parallel to the axis of rotation. The equator divides the surface into the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere.
