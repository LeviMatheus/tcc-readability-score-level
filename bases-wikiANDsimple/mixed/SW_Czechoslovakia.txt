Czechoslovakia (Czech: "Československo", Slovak: "Česko-Slovensko"/before 1990 "Československo") was a country in Europe that existed from 1918 until 1992.
In 1938 Nazi Germany took over Czechoslovakia. After World War II the USSR kept part of eastern Czechoslovakia so that they could have a border with Hungary. The USSR also kept parts of Poland and Romania. All four of these countries were in the USSR's sphere of influence. The USSR thought that this meant they could make sure the countries did what they wanted. In 1968 the USSR thought that the government of Alexander Dubcek was moving away from communism and invaded Czechoslovakia.
On January 1, 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, in what was known as the "Velvet Divorce". This was because the peaceful revolution which got rid of the old communist dictatorship was called the "Velvet Revolution".
