Glen Campbell (born April 22, 1936) is an American musician and singer. Nearly all of his solo works have been in the Country music genre. Before his solo career, he played guitar on rock and pop music records, including "Mary, Mary" by The Monkees. Campbell joined The Beach Boys for a short time, when Brian Wilson became ill.
Campbell guest-starred on "The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour". He later hosted a series of his own, "The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour".
His popular songs include "Galveston", "By The Time I Get to Phoenix", "Wichita Lineman", "Try a Little Kindness", "Gentle On My Mind", "Sunflower", and "Hey Little One". Many of his popular songs were written by Jimmy Webb, a talented young songwriter. In 1975, Campbell's most popular song was "Rhinestone Cowboy". The song became a phenomenon, and rhinestone-covered clothing became a fad.
Campbell had more hits after "Rhinestone Cowboy". These include "Country Boy (You Got Your Feet in L. A.)" and "Can You Fool?" but his career was not going well in the late 1970s. He seemed to suffer from public overexposure. His romance with Tanya Tucker, a much-younger country singer, did not help the way many people saw Campbell. He stopped recording, and cut back on his public appearances.
Years later, Campbell returned to recording and appearing on television. In the 1990s, people were again interested in his music and career. Personal problems, though, seemed to get as much attention as the good things in his career. These problems included when Campbell was arrested for drunk driving. His music is still popular with fans, and is part of popular culture.
