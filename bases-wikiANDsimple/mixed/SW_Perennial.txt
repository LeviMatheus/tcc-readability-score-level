A perennial is a plant that bears leaves and perhaps flowers every year. Some plants only bear leaves and flowers once, then they die. Such plants are called "annual". Other plants live for two years. They are called "biennial".
Most trees and shrubs are perennial plants.
The word perennial can also refer to a tradition, an event, or a seasonal item that remains popular every year, such as a holiday song.
