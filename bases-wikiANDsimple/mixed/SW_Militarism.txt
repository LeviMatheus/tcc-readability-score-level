Militarism or militarist ideology is a view on society.
It says society should be like the military.
This means that society should follow concepts that can be found in the culture, system and people of the military. People that say militarism is good are called "militarists".
Most important to militarists is "discipline". Discipline means to follow a set of rules.
It also means training that follows such rules. A strong military, they say, is good for discipline.
There are many areas where moral goals and the culture of the military can be applied. Most notable are private business, government, education and entertainment.
