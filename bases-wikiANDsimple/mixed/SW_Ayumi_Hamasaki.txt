Ayumi Hamasaki (浜崎あゆみ "Hamasaki Ayumi", born October 2, 1978) is a Japanese female singer.
Born and raised in Fukuoka, she released her first single "Nothing from Nothing" in 1998. Her next four singles were fairly popular, but not as much as her first album, which was released in 1999 and sold over a million copies. To date, she has released eight full albums, one mini album, 40 singles, four greatest hits albums, and several remix albums. Selling over 50 million copies, she is the fourth top-selling artist in the history of Japan. Out of all her albums, "A Best" (2001), which is a greatest hits album, sold the most.
Although she has ear damage in her left ear, she is still singing. She is, however, working to stay healthy.
Cultural impact.
Hamasaki has affected high school girls the most. Since becoming a superstar in 2000, she has appeared on fashion magazines such as "ViVi" and "Popteen." She made oversized glasses and fake fox tails popular. When she became the face of cosmetics company "Kose Visee", the company sold more than 500,000 lipsticks in two days.
