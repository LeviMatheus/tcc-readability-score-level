Lady Frances Brandon (July 16, 1517 – November 20, 1559) was the daughter of Mary Tudor of England (1495 – 1533) and Charles Brandon, Duke of Suffolk. She was married to Henry Gray, Duke of Suffolk and had three daughters, who were called Jane, Mary and Katherine. Her daughter Jane became the Queen of England for nine days.
Life.
Frances Brandon was a cruel, abusive mother to her children and a bold wife to her husband, Henry Grey. She had spent her childhood with her mother and was very close to Catherine of Aragon, so she was against Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn. In 1533, she married Henry Grey and soon she had two children who died young before having Lady Jane Grey in 1537, Katherine in 1540, and Mary in 1545.
In 1554, just weeks after her daughter Lady Jane Grey's and her husband Henry Grey's execution, Frances married again. This time it was to Adrian Stokes. Many people where shocked about this marriage, because Adrian was far below Frances's status. Historians believe that Frances was pregnant at the time of their marriage because she gave birth to a child about six months later. This child did not survive and Frances had two others. None of her children lived past a year.
Death.
Frances became increasingly large similar to her great-uncle Henry VIII. Because of this, she died in 1559 and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
