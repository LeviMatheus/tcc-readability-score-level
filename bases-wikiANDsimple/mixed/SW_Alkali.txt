In chemistry, an alkali is an aqueous (from water) solution with a pH of more than seven.
The word 'Alkali' comes from the Arabic 'qali' meaning 'from the ashes' since ashes mixed with water were used as cleaning products.
An alkali is where a base is dissolved in water. Often it is the salt of an Alkali metal
An alkali is the opposite to an acid and can be neutralised (brought down to pH 7) by adding acid.
Characteristics.
The higher the number is over 7 on the pH scale the stronger the alkali is.
Strength of an Alkali.
Someone can find out how strong or weak and alkali is by adding universal indicator to it. Some universal indicator can be poured into it or use pH paper which is soaked with universal indicator. (i.e- soap and toothpaste are minor-strength alkalis)
