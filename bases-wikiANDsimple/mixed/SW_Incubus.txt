In the Middle Ages, people in Europe believed that Incubi (One Incubus, several Incubi) were male demons. They lay on sleeping people, to have sexual intercourse with them. According to legend, they mostly did that to women. They would also do this to make other incubi. While they had sex with their victim, they drained its energy. They did this to sustain themselves. Some sources say that the incubus may be identified by its unnaturally cold penis. Religious tradition holds that repeated intercourse with such a spirit by either males or females (the female version of the incubus is called a succubus) may result in the deterioration of health, or even death.
