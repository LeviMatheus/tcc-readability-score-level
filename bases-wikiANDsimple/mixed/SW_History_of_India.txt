The Paleolithic era.
Some old fossils found in India indicate presence of living beings called Homo Erectus. Archeologists think that these beings were living in India between 200,000 to 500,000 years ago. This period is known as the paleolithic era. Human beings (Homo Sapiens) settled in the Indian subcontinent at least 12,000 years before. At that time the last Ice Age had just ended. First settlements of human beings in India are found in Bhimbetka, a place near Bhopal (Madya Pradesh state, India).
The Neolithic era.
About 7000 years before, by 5100 BC, early Neolithic culture had developed in India. People had learned farming. They tended goats, lived in houses build of mud, and had learned to make baskets. Potteries were also made.
During the period 6000 BC and 2000 BC, late Neolithic culture and the beginning of the Bronze Age was taking shape in the Indus Valley of Ancient India.
The Bronze age.
Bronze Age was an important period of India’s prehistory. From this time onwards a solid base for more development came.
Indus Valley civilization.
The Indus Valley Civilization flourished from about 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE. It marked the beginning of the urban civilization on the subcontinent. It was centred on the Indus River and its tributaries. It is thought that a gradual deforestation caused by geological disturbances and climate change caused the fall of the civilization.
The civilization is famous for its cities that were built of brick, had a road-side drainage system and multi-storied houses.
Vedic civilization.
The Vedas are the oldest texts of India. There are four Vedas, and the first one is the Rigveda. The other three are Samveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda. The Vedas have verses in praise of gods and others. They also have other information. At that time, the society was pastoral. After the Rigveda, society became more agricultural. People became divided into four classes depending on the type of the work. Brahmins were priests and teachers. Khastriyas were the warriors. Vaishyas did agriculture, trading and commerce. The shudras were the general working class. This type of social division is called the Varna system in Hinduism.
During the period of the Vedic civilization, there were many Aryan clans and tribes. Some of them combined and became bigger like the kingdom of the Kurus.
Islam spread across the Indian subcontinent over a period of 500 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established sultanates in Delhi. In the early 16th century, descendants of Genghis Khan swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal (Mogul) Dynasty, which lasted for 200 years. From the 11th to the 15th centuries, southern India was dominated by Hindu Chola and Vijayanagar Dynasties. During this time, the two systems--the prevailing Hindu and Muslim--mingled, leaving lasting cultural influences on each other
