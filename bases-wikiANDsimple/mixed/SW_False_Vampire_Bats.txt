The False Vampire Bats ("Megaderma") are a subfamliy of bats. They are two species that occur in Asia. They are unrelated to the Vampire bats (which only occur in South America). Unlike the vampire bats, they also do not feed on blood, but are insectivores. They are also unrelated to the Spectral Bat (which is called "Vampyrum", but which is an omnivore)
