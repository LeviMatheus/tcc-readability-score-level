Scales are used to measure the weight of an item. To use a scale, the item which needs to be weighed is put on one side of the scale. Then, weigh stones are put on the other side. Once the scale balances (that is the indicator between the two scales is in the middle), the correct weight was chosen.
There are also modern scales, where the item is simply put on the scale. Its weight can then be read from an electronic or analogue display.
