Fear is an emotion similar to anxiety. A person who fears something does not want it to happen, because they think something bad will happen to them if it does. Fear is the body's way of protecting itself from possibly dangerous situations. If we did not fear things then we would probably be dead because when we fear something like jumping of a cliff, then we would probably not do it, so if we jumped off a cliff then we would probably die. If we have a fear of jumping off of the cliff then we would not do it so we would not die.
