In medicine stroke (or cerebrovascular accident (CVA)) means a rapidly developing loss of brain function due to a disturbance in the blood vessels supplying blood to the brain. In medicine, the process of being struck down by a stroke, fit, or faint is sometimes referred to as an ictus "[cerebri]", from the Latin "icere" ("to strike"), especially before a definitive diagnosis.
Stroke is a medical emergency and can cause permanent neurological damage and death if not promptly diagnosed and treated. It is the third leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the United States and Europe.
The symptoms of a stroke are depend on the speed of onset of the problem and the anatomical location of the damage and therefore there are quite a lot of different ones. A doctor will generally first localize the lesion on the basis of a "snapshot" assessment of the symptoms and signs. This "snapshot" view will not be specific for the "cause" of the stroke, but rather the anatomical location of the lesion. The speed of onset of the neurological deficit (fast or "stroke-like") in addition to risk-factor profile, indicates to a doctor that the symptoms are due to a blood vessel problem rather than other causes.
Risk factors for stroke include advanced age, hypertension (high blood pressure), previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack, diabetes, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, atrial fibrillation, migraine with aura, and thrombophilia (a tendency to thrombosis). In clinical practice, blood pressure is the most important modifiable risk factor of stroke; however many other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking and treatment of atrial fibrillation with anticoagulant drugs, are important.
