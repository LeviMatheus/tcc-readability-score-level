Anabaptist is a term to refer to certain Christian movements. The followers of these movements think that believers should be baptized; only someone who believes can be validly baptized; the baptism of infants has to be confirmed with what they call "believers baptism". The best-known anabaptists today are the Mennonites, the Hutterites and the Amish.
