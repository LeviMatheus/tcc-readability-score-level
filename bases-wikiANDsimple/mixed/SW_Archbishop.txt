In Christianity, an archbishop is an important bishop. In the Catholic Church, when a bishop becomes an archbishop, he is not given any more Holy Orders or any other sacrament. The word comes from the Greek αρχι, which means "first" or "chief", and επισκοπος, which means "over-seer" or "supervisor".
