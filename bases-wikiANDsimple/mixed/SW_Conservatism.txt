Conservatism is a political idea. Followers of conservatism, called conservatives, like the way things are now, or like the way things were in the past. Conservatives want the government to act to either protect our current way of life, or to return to a better way of life that we used to enjoy.
In the old days, the slogan of conservatives was "God, King, and country". Today, conservatives are usually religious, patriotic, and value tradition. Conservatives think that new ideas are often dangerous, that the old ways are best, and that change, if it comes, should come slowly.
Edmund Burke is called "The Father of Conservatism". Other conservatives include Margaret Thatcher, Barry Goldwater, William F. Buckley, and Ronald Reagan.
