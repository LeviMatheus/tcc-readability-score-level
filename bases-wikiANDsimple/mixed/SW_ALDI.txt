Aldi is a supermarket that can be found in Germany and in most parts of the European Union. Aldi shops also exist in Australia and the United States. Most German towns and villages have at least one Aldi shop. There are about 4,100 stores in Germany, and 7,600 worldwide. The name of the shop stands for "ALbrecht-DI'"scount".
The company is a food retailer, but it also sells non-food at times. In the 1990s, Aldi often sold computers that were sought after. Aldi has a reputation for being cheap and forces its suppliers to sell to them at low prices.
History.
The company was started in 1913 as a family business. In 1946, the brothers Karl Albrecht and Theo Albrecht tookover the business from their mother and started the idea of discount shops in Germany. In 1960, the company was split into Aldi Nord (Aldi North) and Aldi SÃ¼d (Aldi South).
