Taoism or Daoism is a type of belief.
It is at least 2,500 years old and it comes from China. Some people call Taoism a religion, other people call it a philosophy. People disagree about what to call it because it means different things to different people.
Instead of spending a lot of time trying to explain what the Tao is, Taoists focus on living a simple and balanced life in harmony with nature. This is one of the most important principles in Taoism. Taoists also believe that conflict is not good and that if you have a problem with something, it is better to find a way around it.
