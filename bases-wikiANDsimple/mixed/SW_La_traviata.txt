"La traviata" is an opera in three acts and is written by Giuseppe Verdi. It is based on a novel called "La dame aux Cam√©lias" by Alexandre Dumas, fils, published in 1848. It was first performed at the Teatro la Fenice in Venice, on March 6, 1853. The title "La traviata" means literally "The Woman Who Strayed", or perhaps more figuratively, "The Fallen One". Piave and Verdi wanted to follow Dumas in giving the opera a contemporary setting, but the authorities at La Fenice insisted that it be set in the past. It was some years before the composer's and librettist's original wishes were carried out.
