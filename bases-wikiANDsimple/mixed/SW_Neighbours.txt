"Neighbours" is an Australian soap opera. The show started airing in March 1985 on the Seven Network, but they cancelled it the same year. Rival network Network Ten decided to start making and broadcasting the show, and have done that since 1986. The show originally had low ratings, and Network Ten did their best to get them higher. They got new characters, two of them were played by Kylie Minogue and Jason Donovan. These two characters became a couple known as "Scott and Charlene", and by the time they got married in 1987, ratings were much higher.
The show is about the lives of people that live in a fictional street called Ramsay Street. Ramsay Street is in a fictional suburb, Erinsborough, which is meant to exist in real-life city Melbourne.
