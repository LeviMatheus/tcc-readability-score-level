The Solar Wind is not, as the name suggests, wind. It is a stream of charged particles shot out of the Sun. They are shot out at such speed that they can travel the whole length of the Solar System, nearly 1 lightyear. The particles are dangerous to people and spacecraft. Earth has a magnetic field which absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the "northern lights" or "aurora borealis."
