The Rugby World Cup is the most important competition in the sport of rugby union. The cup happens every four years. The first one was in 1987. The next one is being held in 2011, in New Zealand. The competition is one of the biggest sporting events in the world (along with the FIFA World Cup and the Olympics).
There are only 20 spots available in a Rugby World Cup, so teams must compete for them in a qualifying competition. Teams that reached the knockout stages of the previous tournament automatically qualify for the next tournament.
The current champions are South Africa.
