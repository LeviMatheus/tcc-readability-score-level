Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin (7 June 1848 – 8 May 1903) was a leading Post-Impressionist painter. His bold tests with coloring led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art, and the meaning of the subjects in his paintings helped create Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential user of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.
