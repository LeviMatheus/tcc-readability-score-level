Palestine is a region in the Middle East, but not a country as it does not have its own land.
Many people lived in different parts of Palestine, and built their civilizations. These included Cannanites, Philistines, Phoenicians and Hebrews, just to name a few.
In ancient times, Jews created the Kingdom of Israel in small parts of Palestine called Judea and Samaria. However, they were not the majority of the population.
Judea was conquered by the Babylonians. But Jews returned and rebuilt their civilization. Then, the Romans conquered the whole area and renamed it Palestine after one of Judea's ancient enemies, the Philistines. The region is called the Holy Lands, and is sacred for Muslims, Christans and Jews.
The region called Palestine, today includes Israel, The West Bank and The Gaza Strip. Palestinians and Israelis are discussing creating a Palestinian country most likely to be named Palestine. The country would most likely be composed of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and there has also been talk of dividing Jerusalem.
