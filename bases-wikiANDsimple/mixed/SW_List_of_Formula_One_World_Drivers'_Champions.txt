The Formula One World Drivers' Championship (WDC) is given by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile ("FIA") to the Formula One race car driver with the most points over a season.
The Drivers' Championship was first awarded in 1950, to Nino Farina. The first driver to win more then one Championship was Alberto Ascari, in 1952 and 1953.
The FIA do not officially declare the Champion until the end of the season, but a driver is said to have "clinched" the Championship when no other driver can possibly win more points than them, even if they score the maximum in the remaining races of the season. The Drivers' Championship has been clinched in the final race of the season 23 times in the 56 seasons it has been awarded. The earliest in a season that the Drivers' Championship has been clinched was in 2002, when Michael Schumacher secured the title with six races remaining.
Overall, twenty-eight different drivers have won the Championship, with German Michael Schumacher holding the record for most titles, at seven. Schumacher also holds the record for most consecutive Drivers' Championships, winning five from 2000 to 2004. The current Drivers' Champion is Kimi Räikkönen, who won his World Championship in 2007.
