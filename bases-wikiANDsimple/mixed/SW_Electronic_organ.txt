Some electronic organs (digital organs) are made to look and sound like pipe organs. They can be used in churches and other buildings. They have some advantages over real pipe organs: they can be moved about easily, they do not go out of tune, they do not take up a lot of room (only the console and some loudspeakers are needed), and they are cheaper. They also have many computerised features which can be useful. The problems are that many people think they do not sound as good as pipe organs, and many organists think they do not feel as good to play as a traditional, mechanical pipe-organ.
The other kind of electronic organ is the one found in many homes today. It is based on the Hammond-type organ. The pedals are straight. It is used for jazz or popular music. Many have lots of different tone generators and synthesis modules which can imitate hundreds of instruments.
