In vertebrates, mucus is a slippery secretion found in vertebrates and made by covering mucous membranes. It is a viscous colloid that contains antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozyme) and immunoglobulins that serves to protect epithelial cells in the respiratory,gastrointestinal, urogenital, visual, and auditory systems in mammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. Snails, slugs, hagfish, and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus, which in addition to serving a protective function, can facilitate movement and play a role in communication.
