A rocket is a vehicle, missile or aircraft - manned (e.g. Saturn V); or unmanned (e.g. Phoenix air-to-air missile). ("Manned" means that a person is in it; "unmanned" means that the machine can go without a person.) It can rise because exhaust thrust from the engine is bigger than the weight of the vehicle in relation to its weight on earth.
Defense.
In defense uses, rockets are limited by the same things as other flying machines. Unmanned rockets however are not bound by the gravitational limits of humans. Generally, rockets go faster than the speed of sound (Mach 1) and may reach speeds of up to Mach 5 and even up to 30'000 km/hr in LEO (Low Earth Orbit).
