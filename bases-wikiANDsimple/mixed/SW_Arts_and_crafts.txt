Arts and crafts is a term which is used to describe a wide variety of activities involving making things with one's own hands. Arts and crafts is usually a hobby. Some crafts (art skills) have been practised for centuries, others are more recent inventions.
Both children and adults enjoy arts and crafts. Children is schools may learn skills such as woodwork, carving, sewing, or making things with all sorts of other things. Many community centres and schools have evening or day classes and workshops where one can learn arts and craft skills.
Although "crafts" today are usually hobbies enjoyed by amateurs, the word was used many centuries ago by professional people who had a guild system. Young people were learned from a master-craftsman (i.e. they were "apprenticed"), and they often took many years to learn their skills to perfection.
