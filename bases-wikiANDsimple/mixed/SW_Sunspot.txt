A sunspot is an area of high magnetic activity, on the surface of the Sun. Sunspots produce bright light, but not as much as the surface around them, so they appear dark by comparison.
Galileo Galilei was the first scientist to report his observations of sunspots. At first people did not want to believe his ideas, because they thought "spots" made the Sun "imperfect". Later his ideas were accepted.
Sunspot activity can affect the Earth's own weather, and also radio reception. Scientists keep track of sunspots and other solar phenomena, to better understand their effect. A sunspot cycle of 11 years has been detected, with high and low periods of activity.
