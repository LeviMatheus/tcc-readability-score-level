Suchomimus ("crocodile mimic") was a fish-eating (and meat-eating) large spinosaurid theropod dinosaur with a crocodile-like are during the middle portion of the Cretaceous period in Africa.
It was about 36 feet (11 m) long, about 12 feet tall, and walked on two powerful hindlegs. This carnivore had short clawed arms with three fingers.
