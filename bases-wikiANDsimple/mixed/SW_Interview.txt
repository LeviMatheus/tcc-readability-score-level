An interview is a conversation between two people where one of the people is trying to get information from the other person. The person asking questions is called the "interviewer" and the person answering questions is called the "interviewee". Police interview suspects and witnesses to a crime to try and find out what happened. Employers interview people trying to get a job to find out if they are a good person for the job. Researchers might use an interview ask people to find how they feel about a certain issue. For example, what TV shows they like.
