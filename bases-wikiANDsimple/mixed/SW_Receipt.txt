A receipt is usually a piece of paper, but in some parts of the world they can also be hard tokens. The word comes from "receive", which means "to get".
Receipts are used to show or prove that someone has got or received something. It usually shows proof that something has been paid for. It might also be used to show that something was brought in to be fixed, for example, a bicycle.
