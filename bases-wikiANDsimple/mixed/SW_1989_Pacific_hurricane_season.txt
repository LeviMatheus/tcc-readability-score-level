The 1989 Pacific hurricane season officially started May 15, 1989 in the Eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1989 in the Central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1989. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean.
Notable storms include Hurricanes Cosme, Kiko, and Raymond. Cosme crossed over Mexico and contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Allison in the Atlantic. Hurricane Kiko made landfall on the Gulf of California side of the Baja California peninsula. Hurricane Raymond was the strongest storm of the season, but weakened significantly before landfall.
