Demand is how much is bought of something based on a price. It indicates how much it is needed or wanted. In economics, the Law of supply and demand will decide the price at which something will be bought and sold.
Sometimes the demand doesn't change much no matter what the price is. One example is when people are addicted to illegal drugs. These people need to get their drugs, they will pay any price they can afford.
