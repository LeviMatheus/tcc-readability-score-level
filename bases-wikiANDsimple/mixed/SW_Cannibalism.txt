Cannibalism is the practice of eating your own species. If it refers to humans, some people call it anthrophagy.
People eating other people.
If it occurs in humans, scientists are unclear if it is widespread or not. There are certain diseases, like the sleeping disease, that are passed on by eating human nerve tissue, especially the brain. Sometimes, cannibalism was observed with people that have mental problems or some diseases of the mind.
Cannibalism in non-human species.
In non-human species, cannibalism is quite common, for example with spiders and scorpions. There, the male gets eaten by the female, after having sex.
