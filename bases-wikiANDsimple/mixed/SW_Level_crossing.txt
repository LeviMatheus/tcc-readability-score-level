A Level crossing (or railroad crossing) is the place where a railway line and a road intersect on the same level. This means that the grades are not separated, like using a bridge or a tunnel. Usually, there are signs indicating the crossing. There may also be barriers/gates that go down before a train passes.
Since level crossings are dangerous (there are many accidents), they are usually replaced by grade separation once there is more traffic, or high speed trains.
