Everton.
Rooney grew up in Liverpool, where there are two big football clubs: Liverpool F.C. and Everton F.C. As a child, Wayne supported Everton and began playing football for them at the age of only 16, when he became the youngest Premiership scorer, scoring a winning goal against Arsenal F.C.. Rooney started playing fantastic football for Everton and was the top scorer at Euro 2004, a competition where he played for England. Soon, other clubs wanted to buy him. Newcastle United F.C. and Manchester United both made offers to Everton for him. It was Manchester United who signed him eventually, for £23m in the summer of 2004. Rooney was only 18 at the time, and the £23m paid for him is the highest amount ever paid for a teenager, in the world.
