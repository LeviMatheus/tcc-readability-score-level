Many periods have been called golden periods in the History of India, because there were different important achievements at different times.
Ancient India.
The period between the 3rd century and 6th century CE is known as the Golden Age of India because of the large achievements Indians made in the fields of mathematics, astronomy, science, religion and philosophy during the Gupta Empire. The decimal numeral system, including the concept of zero, was invented in India during this period. The peace and prosperity created under leadership of Guptas made remarkable scientific and artistic activities in India possible. The Golden Age in India came to an end when the Hunas invaded the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE.
Medieval India.
South India in the 10th and 11th century CE under the imperial Chola Dynasty has been called Golden Age as well. The period saw extensive achievements in architecture, Tamil literature, sculpture and bronze working, maritime conquests with extensive trade, and quasi-democratic reforms.
