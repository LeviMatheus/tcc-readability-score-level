The Charlotte was one of six convict transport ships in the First Fleet. The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. The "Charlotte" was a ship of 335 tons under the command of Thomas Gilbert. The ship had a contract with the British Government to carry convicts. The owners were paid at a rate of 10 shillings per ton per month. They had to agree to keep the prisoners secure and in safe custody. After transporting the convicts to New South Wales, the "Charlotte" was under contract to work for the East India Company.
