Africa-Eurasia, or Afro-Eurasia, is a supercontinent and the world's biggest landmass. Around 85% (approximately 5.5 billion) of the World population lives there. It is typically subdivided by the Suez Canal into the continents of Africa and Eurasia, the latter of which has been historically further subdivided into Europe and Asia. Historians of the cultural materialism school may subdivide it into Eurasia-Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, based on differing agricultural systems and other differences.
Some geographers and historians have referred to it as Eurafrasia or Afrasia, but these terms have never come into general use. In geopolitics the mainland of Africa-Eurasia (excluding islands such as the British Isles, Japan and Madagascar) has been referred to as the World Island.
The Old World includes Africa-Eurasia and its surrounding islands.
In geological terms, Africa-Eurasia (or Eurafrasia) will be a supercontinent when Africa collides with Europe. This is estimated to happen in 600,000 years, when the southern tip of Spain reaches Africa. When this happens, the Mediterranean Sea will be isolated from the Atlantic Ocean. Africa is expected to collide with Europe completely in 50 million years, closing the Mediterranean, and creating new, future mountain ranges (with an addition to the Alps), which might be called the Mediterranean Mountains.
