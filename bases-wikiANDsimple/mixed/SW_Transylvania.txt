Transylvania is a region in the country of Romania. It is one of the historical regions of the country. Through history, it also sometimes belonged to Hungary, was part of Austria-Hungary, was an independent principality, or belonged to the Ottoman Empire.
Transylvania's main city, Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsvár), is seen as the region's historical capital. But Transylvania was also ruled from Alba Iulia (Gyulafehérvár) during its dependence from the Ottoman Empire, and the seat of the Transylvanian Diet was moved to Sibiu for some time in the 19th century.
In popular culture, Transylvania is mainly known as the seat (and origin) of Count Dracula. This vampire story by Bram Stoker is based on a local nobleman Vlad Tepes, known for his cruelty.
