WrestleMania 2000 was the sixteenth yearly WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). It happened on April 2, 2000 at the Arrowhead Pond arena in Anaheim, California. This WrestleMania is different from others, because it is the only WrestleMania not to feature at least one standard one on one wrestling match. It is also the only WrestleMania to use the year in it's name.
