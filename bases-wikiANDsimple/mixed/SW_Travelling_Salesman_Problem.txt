The Travelling Salesman Problem (often called TSP) is a problem to solve. It is about optimisation. Optimisation is about finding a better solution or answer to a problem. In this context "better solution" often means "a solution that is cheaper". TSP is a mathematical problem. But it can be shown as a picture very easily with graph theory.
Stating the problem.
The problem is that of a salesman. To do his job, he has a number of places (cities) he should go to. Some of those cities are connected with each other, for example by airplanes, or by road or railway. Each of those links between the cities has one or more weights (cost) attached. The cost is how much it takes to travel the route, for example, the cost of an airplane ticket or train ticket. The question is how to find the best route for the salesman to go to the cities. The salesman wants to keep both the travel costs, as well as the distance he travels as low as possible. He must go to each city exactly once, and at the end, he must be in the city he started in.
How hard the problem is.
The travelling salesman problem is among the problems that are very hard to solve. If there is a way to break this hard problem into smaller problems, the smaller problems will be at least as hard as the original one. This is what computer scientists call NP-hard problems.
Many people have studied this problem. The easiest (and most expensive solution) is to simply try all possibilities. The problem with this is that for N cities you have (N-1) factorial possibilities. This means that for only 11 cities there are about 3.5 million combinations to try.
