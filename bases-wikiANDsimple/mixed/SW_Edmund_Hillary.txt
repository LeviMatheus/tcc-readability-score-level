Sir Edmund Percival Hillary, (born July 20, 1919, died January 11, 2008) was a New Zealand mountaineer and explorer. Along with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay, he was the first successful person to climb Mount Everest on May 29, 1953. Mount Everest is the tallest mountain on earth. During his teenage years, Edmund Hillary had attended Auckland Grammar School.
Sir Edmund Hillary was the first New Zealander in the world to conquer the mighty Mt. Everest in Nepal. He is on the New Zealand five dollar note. He also climbed ten other mountains after Mount Everest, all of which are also located in the Himalayas.
Early Life.
Hillary was born to Percival Augustus Hillary and Gertrude Hillary, n√©e Clark, in Auckland, New Zealand, on 20 July 1919. His family moved to Tuakau (south of Auckland) in 1920, after his father (who served at Gallipoli) had gotten land there. His grandparents were early settlers in northern Wairoa in the mid 19th century after moving from Yorkshire, England.
Hillary learned at Tuakau Primary School and then Auckland Grammar School. He finished primary school two years early, but he did not do very well at high school. At first, he was smaller than other students there and very shy so he felt safe with his books and often thought of a life filled with adventure. Every day, he rode a train to and from high school, and he often used this time to read. Learning how to box helped him become more confident. At age 16 his interest in climbing started during a school trip to Mount Ruapehu. Although very tall at 6 ft 5 in (195cm), he found that he was stronger than many of his fellow hikers.
He learned about mathematics and science at The University of Auckland, and in 1939 he completed his first important climb, which was reaching the top of a mountain called Mount Ollivier. With his brother Rex, Hillary became a beekeeper during summertime, which allowed him to do climbing in the winter.
