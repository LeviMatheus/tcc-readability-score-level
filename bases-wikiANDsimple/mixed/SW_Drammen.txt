Drammen is a city and municipality in the county of Buskerud, Norway.
Drammen was established as a municipality January 1, 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The rural municipality of Skoger was merged with Drammen January 1, 1964. (And then transferred from the county of Vestfold to the county of Buskerud.)
Drammen is one of the larger cities in Norway, and lies about 47 km from the capital of Norway, Oslo. The city centre lies at the end of a valley, on both sides of the river Drammenselva, and where the river meets the Drammensfjord. Drammen is also the main city for car and fruit import in Norway.
The name.
The Norse form of the name was "Drafn", and this was originally the name of the inner part of Drammensfjord. The fjord is, however, probably named after the river Dramselva (Norse "Dr√∂fn").
