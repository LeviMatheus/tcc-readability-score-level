Lolo Ferrari, born Eve Valois (February 9, 1963 - March 5, 2000) was a French dancer and actress billed as "the woman with the largest breasts in the world", though their size was artificially achieved.
Encouraged by her husband, Ferrari underwent numerous plastic surgery operations to create a 180-cm (71-inch) silicone-enhanced bust (22 enlargements, a Guinness world record).
