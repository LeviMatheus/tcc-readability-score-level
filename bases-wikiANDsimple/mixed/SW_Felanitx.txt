Felanitx is on the east side of Majorca close to Porto Colom on the coast. It is from Palma.
It is the centre of a very touristic area (there are more than 2.300 hotel rooms), especially in summer.
It is the home town of the famous painter Miquel Barcel√≥, who has just worked in the cathedral of Palma.
