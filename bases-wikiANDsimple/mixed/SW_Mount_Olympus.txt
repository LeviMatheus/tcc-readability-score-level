Mount Olympus (; also transliterated as Ólympos, and on Greek maps, Óros Ólimbos) is the highest mountain in Greece at 2,919 metres high (9,570 feet). Since its base is located at sea level, it is one of the highest mountains in Europe in terms of topographic prominence, the relative altitude from base to top.
In Greek mythology the mountain was regarded as the "home of the gods", specifically of the Dodekatheon, the twelve principal gods of the ancient Hellenistic world.
