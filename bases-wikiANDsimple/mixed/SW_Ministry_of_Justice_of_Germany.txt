The Reich Justice Office was created in 1875. It was a part of the Chancellor's department until 1 January 1877 when it became independent. The first Minister of Justice was appointed in 1919, when the Office of Justice became the "Reichsministerium der Justiz" of the Weimar Republic
Political.

Role.
Germany is a federal country. The administration of the justice and criminal prosecution is mainly a matter for the federal states.
The federal ministry's main job is ensuring that federation and the states, and all laws, keep within the "Rule of Law".
The ministry also oversees the laws about qualifying and working as a judge, prosecutor, lawyer or notary
The ministry has also been responsible for the legal problems after the reunification of Germany. This meant changing a lot of criminal and administrative law. Also professional rehabilitation was needed. Judges and lawyers were just some of the people who were used to working in the communist system, and now had to change.
Furthermore the ministry checks that all laws and ordinances prepared by other ministries do not break the constitution.
The Ministery publishes the official newspaper the "Bundesgesetzblatt" the Federal Law Gazette und "Bundesanzeiger" the Federal Gazette. It also prepares the elections of Judges to the Bundesverfassungsgerichts and the highest level of federal courts.
