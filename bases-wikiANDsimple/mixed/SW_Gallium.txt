Gallium (chemical symbol: Ga) is chemical element 31 on the periodic table.
Gallium is a metal, but is has some unusual properties. If it is held in a person's hand, it will melt. Gallium does not conduct electricity well, and is known as a semiconductor. That means gallium can be used in computers to make them work. It is very shiny, so it is used to paint mirrors when melted.
Gallium is not dangerous to people, because there is not much of it on the Earth.
