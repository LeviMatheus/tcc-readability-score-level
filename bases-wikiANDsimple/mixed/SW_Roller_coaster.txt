The roller coaster (some people say the simple form coaster) is a kind of amusement ride. A roller coaster is like a train. It has a number of carriages that travel on a set of tracks. This track has hills and valleys, and sometimes has other features that will turn the train upside-down. The track can be made from wood or steel. Some roller coasters are made for children, so they do not travel very fast. Other roller coasters are made very tall and they travel very fast.
Science.
A roller coaster works because of gravity, a force that pulls things down to the ground. Most roller coaster trains are pulled to the top of a hill with a machine. The train will slide down the track, which has a number of hills and valleys. As it slides down a hill, it will travel faster.
History.
In the 18th century, the people of Russia made mountains of ice in the winter. The people rode down the slopes for fun. In the United States, LaMarcus Adna Thompson patented the first roller coaster on January 20, 1865. He named his ride the "Switchback Railway," and workers pulled the carriage to the top of the track.
