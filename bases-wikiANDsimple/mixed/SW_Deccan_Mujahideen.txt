The Deccan Mujahiddeen is believed to be a terrorist group. They do attacks inside India. They came to the attention of the public after they said they were responsible for the attacks on Mumbai on 26 November 2008. It is possible that the organization could be related to the Indian Mujahideen.
Where the word is from.
Deccan refers to the Deccan Plateau in southern India. The states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu lie on this plateau. The name is an anglicised from the Prakrit word "dakkhin". That word comes from the Sanskrit word "dakṣiṇa-" (), meaning 'South' or 'The South'.
Mujahideen (also spelt Mujahedin) in Arabic is a "struggler". So the name Deccan Muhahideen may literally mean "Strugglers of the South", "The South Strugglers" or "South Strugglers".
