Usury is a very high, often extortionate rate of interest on a loan.
Loan sharks are otherwise known as usurers, as they often charge a lot of interest for very short term loans.
Usury is illegal in many parts of the world. In some countries charging any interest at all is illegal.
Some people argue that this is against the Old Testament, which states that those who lend to someone in need will be blessed, but the point about usury is the high levels of interest, not the act of lending in itself.
