The Tyrannosaurus was a big predator from the Cretaceous time. The Tyrannosaurus was about 12 meters long and had a weight of about six tons. The teeth of the Tyrannosaurus were about 16 cm long.
The Tyrannosaurus ate meat. Some scientists argue about whether or not it was a hunter or a scavenger, but like most dominant meat-eaters of today, such as lions or hyenas, Tyrannosaurus might have done both. It had a very strong jaw, and its bite power could snap the bones of other dinosaurs. For a long time, Tyrannosaurus was said to be the biggest meat-eating dinosaur, but new dinosaurs have been found that might outsize it. Skeletons of the Tyrannosaurus were found on the North American continent, but relatives of Tyrannosaurus, like Tarbosaurus, have been found in Asia.
The earliest Tyrannosaurus skeletons were found in 1892. Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the American Museum of Natural History, named the species "Tyrannosaurus Rex" (meaning "tyrant lizard king") in 1905. The most complete skeleton was found in 1990 in South Dakota.
Tyrannosaurus has become very popular. Many movies and television shows have featured Tyrannosaurus, such as Jurassic Park. The skeletons of Tyrannosaurus are popular exhibits in museums. Another name for Tyrannosaurus Rex is "T-Rex". It was harmful to many dinosaurs.
