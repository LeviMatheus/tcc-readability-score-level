Huntly () is a town in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, formerly known as Milton of Strathbogie. It has a population 4,460 2004 and is the site of Huntly Castle.
Huntly was the home town of the writer George MacDonald. Some of his novels, especially the Robert Falconer and Alec Forbes of Howglen play partly in Huntly, even if the name of the town is changed. So they give a rather good introduction to the life in Huntly in the 19th century.
The local football team is Huntly F.C..
