Anthropomorphism is giving human characteristics, like emotions (feelings like being happy or sad) and the ability to talk, to a living thing or object that is not a human. This living thing or object that is not a human may be a god, an animal, a plant, sound, weather storm, an idea, or any other object. It is often used in stories. The story of the Three Little Pigs with a wolf and pigs that talk and act like humans is an example of anthropomorphism.
