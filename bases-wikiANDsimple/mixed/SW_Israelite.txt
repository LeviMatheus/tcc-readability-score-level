Israelite is a term used to refer to people from the land of Israel, when talking about ancient and Biblical times. It usually refers to a member of one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Nowadays, a person from the modern State of Israel is called an Israeli.
Israelites lived in the kingdom of Israel, near where the country of Israel is now. Israel split off from a kingdom called Judah, whose members were called Jews, but were still Israelites. Israel was conquered by the Babylonians in 721 BC. Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 587 BCE, which started the Diaspora, or spreading out, of the Jews.
