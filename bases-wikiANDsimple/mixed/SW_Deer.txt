Deer are a group of even-toed ungulate mammals. They form the family "Cervidae". They are also called true deer.
A male deer is called "stag" or "buck", a female deer is called "doe", and a young deer is called "fawn".
There are about 40 species of deer. They originally lived in Europe, Asia, North America and South America. Humans also brought deer to Australia and New Zealand.
Male deer have antlers. Exceptions are the Reindeer, where both sexes have antlers, and the Water Deer, which has no antlers at all.
Live.
Deer do not make nests or dens. They find a safe and comfortable place to rest under low hanging evergreen branches. They stay close to where they can find food. In summer, they eat grasses, plants and weeds. In the fall, they like mushrooms and small branches. They do not store their food for the winter. If the snow is not deep, they use their hooves to uncover moss and leaves. If the snow is deep, they eat twigs and branches.
The doe usually has 1 or 2 fawns in the spring. The fawn can stand up right after it is born, but it is weak. The doe will hide each fawn in a different place. They are hard to see because they often have spots on their backs.
Deer have many enemies. Wolves, cougar, dogs and people will eat deer. They are always looking, listening and smelling for danger. They can usually run faster than their enemies.
