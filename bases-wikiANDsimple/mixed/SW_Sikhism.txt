Sikhism is a monotheistic religion, or a religion that believes in one God. The followers are called "Sikhs", and their holy book is the Guru Granth Sahib. 20 million people are followers of sikhism, that makes it the fifth largest religion in the world. It is most popular in Asia.
Sikhism was started in 1469 by Guru Nanak Dev, the first of the "Ten Gurus". It took on a distinct identity in 1699, celebrated by Vaisakhi. This is when Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth guru, started the baptism with Khande di Pahul, and the sikhs were required to keep the 5 K's. This is also called the birth of the Khalsa.
God.
Sikhism teaches that God, or Waheguru, lasts forever, can't be seen, and has no body. It is taught that he created the universe, can destroy it, and keeps it running. He is considered to be infinite, or he always existed and always will. Sikh's worship him, and meditate on his name. They believe everything is a part of god.
Salvation.
Members are all trying to reach salvation, meaning they are trying to break the process of rebirth and become one with god. The thing that is keeping people from reaching union is bad karma. Bad karma is taught to be caused by pride, anger, greed, attachment and lust. Followers try to stay away from these things.
The ten gurus and religious authority.
The term guru comes from the Sanskrit "gurÅ«", which means teacher, guide, or mentor. The traditions and philosophy of Sikhism were established by ten specific gurus from 1469 to 1708. Each guru added to and reinforced the message taught by the previous, and this resulted in the creation of the Sikh religion.
And the eternal Guru is the Guru Granth Sahib, which is a book.
