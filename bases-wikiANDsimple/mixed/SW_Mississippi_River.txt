The Mississippi River is the longest river in the United States. It is one of the longest rivers in the world.
The name "Mississippi" comes from a Native American name that means "big river."
The source of the Mississippi is in the state of Minnesota, near the border with Canada. The Mississippi flows south through the middle of the United States. It flows past the states of Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Mississippi.
The mouth of the Mississippi is in the state of Louisiana, south of the city of New Orleans. The Mississippi flows into the Gulf of Mexico.
The Mississippi has many large tributaries, or rivers that flow into it. The watershed of the Mississippi covers much of the United States. This means that the Mississippi and its tributaries drain much of the United States.
The Mississippi has been extremely important for transportation in the history of the United States. When the United States first became a nation, the Mississippi River was the western boundary of the United States.
At the end of the Mississippi there is a zone in the Gulf of Mexico where very few animals can survive comfortably because of the fertilizer and other chemicals that run off of farms into the river and her tributaries, which then dump them into the gulf.
