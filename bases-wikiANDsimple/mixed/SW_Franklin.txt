"Franklin" is a song by Paramore a band from the same place. The song is about the place they are from and touring and how they dont feel at home. Hayley williams has said franklin is one of the prettiest cites ever.
Franklin is from the debut paramore album All We Know Is Falling the ninth song and the most gentle one, it is used to slow things down, and the version they play live is much different than what you'll hear on the CD
