Nintendogs is a video game for the Nintendo DS. In "Nintendogs", the player has dogs. They give the dogs food and drinks if a dog is good one might get to feed them a dog biscuit or a jerky treat but be careful, don't feed them to many of these wonder treats because then the dog won't want to walk anymore. The dogs can be washed, taken for a walk, taught to do tricks and put into contests.The contests are: agility trial, disc competition and obedience trial. One can find out how to compete in these contests by looking at their care books, under Supplies. At the start of the game one can choose a type of dog and give it a name. One can pat your dog to get trainer points, if a player gets 4,000 trainer points he might get a present.
There are four versions of the game each with different breeds.
They are: dalmatian and friends, chihuahua and friends, labrador and friends and dashund and friends. All breeds are unlockable in every version! You can unlock dogs by increasing your trainer points. However you can only have three dogs at home. To get more you must drop off one at the Dog Hotel. You can only drop off five dogs at a time.
