The Archaea (AmE [ɑɹˈkiə], BrE [ɑːˈkiːə]; from Greek αρχαία, "old ones"; singular Archaeum, Archaean, or Archaeon), also called Archaebacteria (AmE [ɑɹkɪbækˈtɪɹɪə], BrE [ɑːkɪbækˈtɪəɹɪə]), are a major division of living organisms.
Achaea include simple organisms, that were first discovered in extreme environments. Most of them can survive at very high or very low temperatures. Some of them can also survive in highly salty, acidic or alkaline water. Some have been found in geysers, black smokers or oil wells.
