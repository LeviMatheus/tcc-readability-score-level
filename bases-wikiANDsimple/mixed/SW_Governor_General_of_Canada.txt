The Governor General of Canada is the person who represents Canada's Queen (or King). The Queen of Canada does not spend much time in Canada because she is the same person as the Queen of Great Britain.
Once in a while the Prime Minister may want something done that the Governor General is technically not allowed to do on her own. The Prime Minsiter must then go straight to the Queen but she is expected to do whatever the Prime Minister needs done.
MichaÃ«lle Jean is the current Governor General of Canada.
