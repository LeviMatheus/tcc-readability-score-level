Atomic orbitals are a series of concentric spheres in which electrons orbit. It is similar to the solar system, where the sun is the nucleus and the planets are electrons. However, the difference is that the orbits are not circles; they are spheres. The number of atomic orbitals in an element is defined by the period the element is in. Electrons move between orbitals depending on the strength of their charge.
