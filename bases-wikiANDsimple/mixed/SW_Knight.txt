A knight was a soldier in the Middle Ages. Knights were vassals to lords, who would give them land if the knight would fight for them. Knights thought honour was very important, and they had a code of honour called chivalry. They often had a house of arms. Knights today are named by the Queen. This form of title is known as the Order of the British Empire. Knights today are called 'Sir' and then their first name.
