Genetic drift is the effect that random chance has on evolution. Life is too complicated to be entirely predictable. Some of the differences between living things don't help or harm them enough for natural selection to really care about them.
Random chance can make small changes that later turn out to be useful when a new food, or new challenge arrives. Maybe birds with slightly larger bills will end up slightly better able to crack nuts, while those with slightly smaller bills can grab insects from smaller holes in rotten wood. Small differences like that can be acted on by natural selection to cause the birds to end up living in very different ways.
