The Principality of Khachen () was a medieval Armenian principality, in part of historical Artsakh (present-day Nagorno-Karabakh). The regions of Artsakh and Utik were attached to the Kingdom of Armenia in Antiquity. From the twelfth century the Khachen principality dominated the region. The Byzantine emperor Constantine VII addressed his letters to the prince of Khachen with the inscription "To Prince of Khachen, Armenia."
