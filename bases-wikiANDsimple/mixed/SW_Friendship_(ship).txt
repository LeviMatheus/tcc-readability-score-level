The Friendship was a convict transport ship in the First Fleet. The First Fleet carried the convicts and soldiers to Australia to start a penal colony. The ships left England in May 1787 and arrived in Australia in January, 1788. This was the start of European settlement of Australia. The "Friendship" was a ship of 274 tons under the command of Master Francis Walton. The ship had a contract with the British Government to carry convicts. The owners were paid at a rate of 10 shillings per ton per month until the ship returned to Deptford. They had to agree to keep the prisoners secure and in safe custody.
On her return trip with the "Alexander", many of the sailors on the "Friendship" became sick with scurvy. There were not enough sailors fit enough to sail both ships. All the crew went on board the "Alexander", and the "Friendship" was scuttled (sunk) off the coast of Borneo on October 28, 1788.
