The English country house is generally accepted as a large house that was once in the ownership of an individual who in most of the cases owned another great house in the West End of London. The country house was not only a weekend retreat for aristocrats, but also often a full time residence for the minor gentry.
Evolution of the English country house.
The country houses of England have developed over the last 500 years. Before this time larger houses were fortified in most of the cases, because their owners were feudal lords or overlords of their manor. The Tudor period of stability in the country saw the first of the large unfortified coutry houses.
Decline.
With the rise of modern industry, when people left the country to go to the big cities coutry houses decned as there were less people in the country. After 1945 it became very difficult to pay for the huge staff that was required to maintain these houses.
