A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of many sentences, typically between three long sentences or 10 shorter ones. Sometimes however, you might get a paragraph with only one or two long sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to tell where one paragraph ends and another begins.
A paragraph should have the main idea and the first sentence of the paragraph as the key sentence. It gives an idea to the readers about the paragraph. The following sentences will form the "body" of the paragraph and they may give some additional points to explain the key sentence. The last sentence is the conclusive sentence. People start a new paragraph when they begin to either talk or write about a different topic or idea.
A pilcrow mark (Â¶) is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins.
