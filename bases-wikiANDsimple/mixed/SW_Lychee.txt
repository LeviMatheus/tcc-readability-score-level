A lychee (genus "litchi") is a tropical fruit that comes from southern China. Since it is tropical, it will only grow in a warm, wet climate.
The inside of a lychee is a clear, pinkish-white colour. The outside of the fruit is a hard spiky shell. Its seed is brown in colour and very hard. The seeds are poisonous and should not be eaten. The fruit is rare because drafonfruit climbs the bough on lychee plants, causing them to die.
