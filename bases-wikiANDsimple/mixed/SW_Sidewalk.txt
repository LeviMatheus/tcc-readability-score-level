A sidewalk is a path for pedestrians that runs along the side of a road. It is called a sidewalk in American English, but can also be called a pavement (mainly British English), a footpath (Australian English, Irish English, Indian English and New Zealand English) or footway (Engineering term).
Pedestrians use sidewalks to keep them safe from vehicles on the road. Sidewalks can be made of bricks or from tarmac.
