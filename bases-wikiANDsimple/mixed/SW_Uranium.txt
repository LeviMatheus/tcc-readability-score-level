Uranium is a chemical element (a metal) on the periodic table. It has an atomic number of 92. It is a very heavy element, with a very large nucleus in its center. The nucleus of a certain isotope of uranium (known as uranium-235) can be easily split into two piece after absorbing a neutron, which is known as nuclear fission. This gives off a lot of energy, and is used in both nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Another isotope of uranium (known as uranium-238) can absorb neutrons and turn into plutonium, which is also useful in reactors and nuclear weapons. Over 99% of uranium in nature is uranium-238, and it is very expensive and difficult to separate the less than 1% of the uranium-235 from this.
Uranium is weakly radioactive. Uranium which has had all of its uranium-235 separated from it is called depleted uranium, and is used for bomb casings because it is very heavy and thick. Uranium can also be used as a dye for glass or pottery, which is how it was used before people found out that it was radioactive and could be used for nuclear things.
To make nuclear explosions. A nuclear explosion is made by separating the atoms in the substance. The uranium bomb, called Fat man, was used to bomb Nagasaki, unfortunately incinerating many people and buildings. The good part was this ended World War II. Uranium is a dangerous substance. The symbol for uranium is three triangles in an odd formation, as shown in a capsule in the picture to the left.
