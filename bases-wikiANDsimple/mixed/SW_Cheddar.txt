Cheddar is a type of hard cheese made from cow's milk. Its name comes from a village in the county of Somerset in England, where the cheese was first made. Many other countries, such as the United States and Canada make cheddar cheese.
History.
The first record of cheddar cheese dates back to the 12th century
How it is made.
Cheddar cheese is different from other cheeses in how it is made. After the curds are heated, they are cut and stacked. The stacks are then turned periodically and re-stacked. This process is called cheddaring.
Cheddar cheese is sometimes aged in caves for up to 30 months before it is ready to eat.
