Monotremes are a group of mammals that form the order Monotremata. Monotremes are the only mammals that lay eggs, but they still feed their babies with milk.
There are two surviving families of monotremes, with five living species. They all live in Australia and New Guinea. People commonly know them as the platypus and the spiny anteaters. There is only one platypus that exists now, the duck-billed platypus. The four others are the spiny anteaters, or the echidna.
