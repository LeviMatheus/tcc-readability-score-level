The United States Atomic Energy Commission was an agency of the United States government, started after World War II by the United States Congress. It was made to help the development of atomic science and technology. This was because the control of atomic energy was with the people after president Harry S. Truman signed the McMahon/Atomic Energy Act in 1946. Congress then declared that atomic energy should be used for peace, not nuclear war.
