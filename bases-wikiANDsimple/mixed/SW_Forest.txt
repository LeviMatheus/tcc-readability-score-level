A forest is an area of land with many trees. Many animals need forests to live and survive. Forests are very important and can be found all over the World. Many forests are being cut down to for houses to built because of overpopulation.This cutting down of forests is called deforestation and it is causing damage to the natural habitat of animals. Even roads have been built for the peoples to pass though the forest to reach their destination. People have gotten rid of forest to build towns cities, farms, factories and other things that we will use.
Conditions.
Forests usually have an average temperatures of 4°C to 10°C and low temperatures of -10°C to -6°C but they can also have very high temperatures of 20°C to 27°C. Forests are also rich in rain so lots of water related animals live in the pools on the ground in forests.
