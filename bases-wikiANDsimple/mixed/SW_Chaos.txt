Chaos is when something unpredictable, or random happens. It is from the Indo-European root "ghen" which means "to be wide open" or in other words, a very large space. Because early Christians did not understand how to use the word "chaos" properly, the word's meaning changed to "disorder" or random and not normal. It is the opposite of "law and order".
