Baron Georges Léopold Chrétien Frédéric Dagobert Cuvier (August 23 1769–May 13, 1832) was a French naturalist and zoologist. He was the older brother of Frédéric Cuvier (1773–1838), also a naturalist. He was a very important figure in scientific circles in Paris during the early 19th century and helped establish the fields of comparative anatomy and paleontology by comparing living animals with fossils. He is well known because he proved extinction was a fact. He was the most influential person believing in catastrophism in geology in the early 19th century. He opposed early evolutionary theories. His most famous work is the "Règne animal distribué d'après son organisation" (1817; translated into English as "The Animal Kingdom"). He died in Paris of cholera.
