The Mayak accident is a nuclear accident. Mayak (Маяк) means beacon, in Russian. It happened in a nuclear reprocessing plant. That plant used to be known as "Cheljabinsk-65 " near Kishtim (Кыштым). There were many accidents, in the secret plant. The most serious of them happened on September 29,1957. The cooling system of the plant failed to work. A (non-nuclear) explosion occurred. This explosion had the force of about 75 tons of TNT. It released about 20 PetaPCi (about 740 Petabecquerel) of radioactivity. At least 200 people died from radiation sickness. about 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes. More than 470,000 people were exposed to the radiation, without knowing it.
According to different sources, the amount of radioactivity produced by this disaster is between twice and six times that of the Chernobyl accident of 1986. Because the leakage was more limited, this is classified as a Level 6 (of 7) disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Chernobyl is rated at Level 7.
In 2003, Russian authorities closed down the Mayak plant. Lake Karachay, which is close to the plant is seen as one of the most contaminated spots on the planet.
