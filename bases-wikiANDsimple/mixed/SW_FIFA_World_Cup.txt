The FIFA World Cup is the most important competition in the sport of soccer football (association football, or football). The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) organizes the World Cup every four years. More people watch the World Cup finals than any other sporting event in the world -- even more people than the Olympic Games.
The "finals tournament" is held every four years. On the other years there are only "qualifying tournaments" ("qualifiers"). Over 160 national teams play in the qualifiers. The best teams from the qualifiers win a place in the finals. The finals now include 32 teams (before 1998, only 24 teams were allowed). Many years before each World Cup, FIFA picks the host nation, the country where the finals will be held. The 32 teams in the finals then play for four weeks in the host nation to determine the champion (tournament winner).
