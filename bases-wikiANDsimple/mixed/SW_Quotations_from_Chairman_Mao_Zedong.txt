"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" (), better known in the West as "The Little Red Book", was put out by the Government of the People's Republic of China from April 1964 until about 1976. The book is a collection of quotations taken from Mao Zedong's past speeches and books. The book's other title "The Little Red Book" was made by the West for its pocket-sized (or small-sized) version, which was specially sold for easy carrying.
