The Specials were an English new wave/ska band. They were originally from Coventry, England and formed in 1977. They were part of the ska revival in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
During the ska revival, bands began playing 1950s-style Jamaican ska music. The Specials often mixed other popular music styles from the 1970s and 1980s into their music, such as pop music and rock and roll.
