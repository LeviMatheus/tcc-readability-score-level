Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld on August 27,1952) is an American actor and comedian. He is best-known for his alter-ego Pee Wee Herman. He was born in Peekskill, New York and grew up in Sarasota, Florida. He appeared in many movies and TV series in the late 1970s and early 1980s and worked with a group called "The Groundlings". Around this time he created Pee-Wee for a stage show, which was a parody of old kids shows. In 1985, he starred in a movie called "Pee-Wee's Big Adventure", which was very successful. The next year, he got his own TV show, "Pee-Wee's Playhouse", which was a huge hit. In 1991, Reubens was arrested for misbehaving in an adult movie theatre; this ended the Pee-Wee craze and forced Reubens to stop playing the character. He has since appeared in many other movies and there have been rumors that he would return as Pee-wee. These rumours have not been denied by anyone official.
