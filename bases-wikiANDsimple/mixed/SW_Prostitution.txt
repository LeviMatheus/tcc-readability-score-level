A prostitute (also called "hooker", "whore", "hoe", "street walker", "sex worker" or "escort") is a person, most of the time a woman, who has sex with people for money. Prostitution is sometimes called the "world's oldest profession". There have been stories of it in almost every culture and society.
Ways and methods.
Prostitutes walk the streets looking for customers or work at a building called a "brothel". Their boss (the person they work and make money for) is a called a "Madame" (if they are a woman) or a "Pimp" (if they are a man). The city of Amsterdam is famous for its prostitutes in the Red Light District (a part of a city where prostitution is common).
Legal aspects of prostitution.
Many countries have laws about prostitution. Some countries have made prostitiution illegal.
However, in many countries prostitution is legal and it is managed by some organizations under licence. The governments in those countries consider prostitution as a legal job and it can take taxes from prostitutes, who enjoy health care from the ministry of health. In other countries like Turkey it is legal through government but illegal through streets. In some Muslim countries it is punished by death. In Japan, vaginal prostitution is against the law while oral sex prostitution is legal.
