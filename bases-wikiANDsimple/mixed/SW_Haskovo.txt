History.
Archeologists (people who study stuff from long ago) say that people started to live in the Haskovo area about 7,000 years ago.
During the 9th century, a fortress was built, and soon after, a town was built around the fortress. The town was located on a big piece of land between the Klokotnitsa, Harmanliyska, and Maritsa rivers.
In 1395, the "Eski camii" (the Old Mosque) was built as one of the first in the Balkans.
In 1782, the town was known as Marsa (Arab name).
Most Bulgarians started living in Haskovo in the 19th century. The town was a trading center for merchants (people who sell stuff) from Edirne, Enos, and Istanbul. The area became known for producing cotton, silk fabrics, and carpets.
