A Coast Guard is a military or semi-military organization, similar to the Navy, but its main duties are the protection of a country's sea territories from terrorism and crimes, and to rescue ships and boats in danger. The most famous coast guard is the United States Coast Guard (USCG). Sometimes, the coast guard is also a law enforcement organisation. The United States Coast Guard does this.
