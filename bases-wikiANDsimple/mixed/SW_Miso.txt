"Miso" is a thick paste. It is similar to the Korean "doenjang". It is made by fermenting soy beans with sea salt and "kōji". Kōji is the product of fermenting rice, barley, or soybeans with a mold culture, "kōji-kin" (Aspergillus oryzae (麹"Aspergillus oryzae"). Often, grains such as barley or rice, and sometimes other ingredients, are added. Miso tastes salty and, depending on the grains used and fermentation time, may also be sweet. Miso is sometimes used in miso soup.
