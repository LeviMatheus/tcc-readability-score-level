Area is the amount of space a two dimensional (flat) object takes up. It is useful because it is how much of a material is needed to make a hollow container; for example, how much wood is needed to make a wardrobe.
Different shapes have different ways to find the area.
The area of a flat object is related to the surface area and volume of a three-dimensional object.
The area under a curve can be found using integration, from calculus.
Some units used to measure area are square mile and square kilometre.
