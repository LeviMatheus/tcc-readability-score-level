Sexual abuse (also called molestation) is when one person forces another person to unwillingly commit any sexual act. A person who commits sexual abuse is called a molester, abuser, or sexual abuser. When a victim of sexual abuse is under the age of consent, it is known as child sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can lead to many psychological problems, including low self-esteem, clinical depression, and other mental disorders.
