Dameli is a language spoken by about 5,000 people in the Domel Valley, in the Chitral District of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. The main source of information on the Dameli language is an article writen by Norwegian linguist Georg Morgenstierne and published in 1942.
Dameli is a Kafir-Dardic language of the Chitral. The language is classified as a Dardic language. This classification is based more on geography than linguistics.
Dameli is still the main language in the villages where it is spoken. It is commonly learned by children. Most of the people of the villages speak Pashto as a second language. Some also speak Khowar and Urdu. There are no signs of large changes in the languages used in the area.
Morgenstierne wrote that Chitral is the area of the greatest linguistic diversity in the world. Although Khowar is the main language of Chitral, more than ten other languages are spoken there. These include Kalasha-mun, Palula, Dameli, Gawar-Bati, Nuristani, Yidgha, Burushaski, Gujarati, Wakhi, Kyrgyz, Persian and Pashto. Because many of these languages have no written form, letters are usually written in Urdu or Persian.
