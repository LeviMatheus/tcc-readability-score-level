The Guardian is a British newspaper. It is published every day, except on Sunday.
History.
The newspaper was founded in 1821. It was founded by textile traders and merchants. The Guardian was seen as ‘an organ of the middle class’, or in the words of C.P. Scott’s son Ted ‘a paper that will remain bourgeois to the last. "I write for the "Guardian"," said Sir Max Hastings in 2005, "because it is read by the new establishment", reflecting the paper's growing influence.
Three of the four people who wrote leaders for the "Guardian", joined the Social Democratic Party on its foundation in 1982. The paper supported Tony Blair when he wanted to lead the Labour Party, ("Guardian" leader, 2 July 1994) and to become Prime Minister ("Guardian" leader, 2 May 1997).
Characteristics.
Those who read it have a centre-left political orientation.
The Guardian is considered British centre-left (described by American conservatives as "left-wing" as US politics are generally further to the right of the UK).
