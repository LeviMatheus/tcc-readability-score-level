The Actinopterygii (the plural form of "Actinopterygius") is a taxonomical class of animals. The animals in this class are the ray-finned fishes.
The ray-finned fishes get their name from the fact that they have lepidotrichia or "fin rays". Their fins are webs of skin held by bony or horny spines ("rays"). This is different from the fleshy fins of the fish in the order Sarcopterygii.
Actinopterygians are the largest class of vertebrates. There are nearly 30,000 species. They can be found in both fresh water and marine environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams.
