Ahimsa (Sanskrit:अहिम्स) is a word used in Hinduism. The meaning of ahimsa is ‘non-injury”. The practice of ahimsa is now an important aspect of Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. A person who practices ahimsa generally eats vegetarian foods. A religious person who practices ahimsa does not take part in animal sacrifice.
In modern age, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and Martin Luther King each followed a path of Ahimsa, though in different ways. They struggled without fighting, while asking for the rights of their followers.
