Hymenoptera is one a larger orders of insects comprising the sawflies, wasps, bees, and ants. The name is derived from the Greek words "hymen" meaning "membrane" and "ptera" meaning "wings". The name is appropriate not only for the membranous nature of the wings, but also for the manner in which they are "joined together as one" by the hamuli.
