A selectable marker is a gene introduced into a cell that confers a trait suitable for artificial selection. Most often, this is used for bacteria or for cells in culture. They are a type of reporter gene used in laboratory microbiology, molecular biology, and genetic engineering to show the success of a transfection or other procedure meant to introduce foreign DNA into a cell. Selectable markers are often antibiotic resistance genes; bacteria that have been subjected to a procedure to introduce foreign DNA are grown on a medium containing an antibiotic, and those bacterial colonies that can grow have successfully taken up and expressed the introduced genetic material.
An alternative to a selectable marker is a screenable marker, which allows the researcher to distinguish between wanted and unwanted cells.
