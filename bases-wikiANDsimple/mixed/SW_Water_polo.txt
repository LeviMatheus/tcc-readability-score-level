Water polo is a sport played in the water with a ball. It is based on a similar game, polo. The objective of the game is to get the ball into the goal more than the opposing team.
Water polo is a team game. Two teams play a match, which consists of four periods named "quarters". The length of each period is usually between 5 to 8 minutes, but because the amount of time spent on fouls or out throws is not counted in the quarter time, an average quarter lasts around 12 minutes 'real time'.
Each team consists of six field players and one goalkeeper. Water polo players need to be skilled in swimming, ball handing skills, reflexes and awareness.
