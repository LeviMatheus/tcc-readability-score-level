The album contains hits from between "Cuts Like a Knife" (1983) and "Waking Up the Neighbours" (1991), and a new single, "Please Forgive Me". The only song on the album that has never been released as a single is "Kids Wanna Rock" from "Reckless" (1984).
Originally the song "So Far So Good" was going to be included on the album so the album started and finished with a new song but it was dropped. The song was included on disc two of "Anthology".
