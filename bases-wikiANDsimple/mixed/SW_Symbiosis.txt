Symbiosis (pl. symbioses) (from the Greek words "syn" = con/plus and "biono" = living) is an association (relationship) between two living things (microbes, plants or animals). Normally the two living things have shared a long period of evolution close to one another.
The term host is usually used for the larger (macro) of the two members of a symbiosis. The smaller (micro) member is called the symbiont (plural: symbionts), or alternately, symbiote (plural: symbiotes). When a microscopic symbiont lives inside the cells of a host, it is referred to as an endosymbiont.
Types of symbiosis.
In some cases, the term symbiosis is used only if the association is obligatory and benefits both organisms. Symbiosis as defined in this article does not restrict the term to only the mutually beneficial interactions.
Symbiosis may be divided into two distinct categories: ectosymbiosis and endosymbiosis. In ectosymbiosis, the symbiont lives on the body surface of the host, including the inner surface of the digestive tract or the ducts of exocrine glands. In endosymbiosis, the symbiont lives either in the intracellular space of the host or extracellularly.
