Makalani is the name given to a certain palm tree, growing in northern Namibia (Southern Africa).
The seeds look like small coconuts, and the local people, the Ovambos and Himbas, peel the outer ginger looking skin and carve the inner hard core to certain objects of art. The inner core is white with a dark brown skin, the size of a golf ball, and it is hollow inside.
There are now also some hotels, restaurants, and guesthouses which have adopted the name Makalani (in Namibia).
