The American League (or AL) is one of the two leagues that make up Major League Baseball. The other is the National League (or NL). The American League is made up of 14 teams. At the end of each season, four of these teams go to the "post-season" where one will win the American League championship. The champions of the American League plays against the champions of the National League in the World Series. The team that wins the World Series is the champion of Major League Baseball.
Differences.
The only big differences between the American League and the National League is the number of teams (the National League has 16 teams) and that the American League uses the "Designated Hitter" (or DH). The Designated Hitter is a player who does not play in the field, but is used to bat for the worst hitter in his team's "lineup" (usually the pitcher). The National League does not use the Designated Hitter, and all players in the "lineup" must bat and field for themselves.
