Eid ul-Fitr is a Muslim holiday celebrated on the last day of Ramadan, the month of fasting. It lasts 3 days. But in 2008, it lasted nine days with weekend holidays. In this festival, children knock on doors and take chocolate, money, sugar from the other people. Kids kiss adults' hands. Everyone visits each other. People forgive each other.
