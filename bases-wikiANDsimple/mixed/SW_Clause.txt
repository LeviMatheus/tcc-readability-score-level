A clause is a part of a sentence. Each clause has only one main verb. "I love you" is a sentence which has only one clause. "I love you and I will always love you" is a sentence which has two clauses. The two clauses are "I love you" and "I will always love you". These clauses are joined together by the word "and" (a conjunction).
Two clauses can be joined with a pronoun. For example: "I live in London, which is in England". Here, "I live in London" is the first clause, and "which is in England" is the second clause. The word "which" is a pronoun which takes the place of "London". It joins the two clauses.
A sentence can contain many clauses. But sentences with fewer clauses are easier to understand.
A subordinating clause is one which is dependent on the main clause (the primary clause). The main clause makes sense on its own. However, the subordinating clause does not. Eg. "I love you" makes perfect sense left on its own. However, "and always will", does not.
