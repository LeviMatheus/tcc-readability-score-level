K2 is the second highest mountain in the world. It is in the Karakoram section of the Himalayas between Pakistan and China; the National mountain of Pakistan. The mountain is 8,611 metres (28,251 feet) high. It is believed that the mountain is harder to climb than Mount Everest because of its very bad weather. K2 is also much higher than the area around it when compared to Everest. K2 is nicknamed "The Savage Mountain" because of this. As of 2004, only 246 people have climbed to the top of the mountain. At least 56 people have died trying to climb it.
An unofficial name for K2 is Mount Godwin Austen, named for the man who first climbed it.
