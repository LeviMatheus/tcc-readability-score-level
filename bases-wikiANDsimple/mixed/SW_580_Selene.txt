580 Selene is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the asteroid belt. The name Selene is that of an ancient Greek goddess of the Moon.
It was found by Max Wolf in 1905. Its provisional name was 1905 SE.
This body orbits the Sun about half way between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The orbital eccentricity is a bit lower than that of Mars. Based on its light curve, Selene has an estimated rotation period of 0.3947Â±0.0004 days, or just under 9.5 hours. During each rotation, the apparent magnitude varies by 0.27. The diameter of this asteroid is about 46 km. (Some sources list a diameter of up to 56 km.) The albedo is about 7%, comparable to that of the Earth's Moon.
