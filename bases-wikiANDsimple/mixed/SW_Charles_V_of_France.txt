Charles V (21 January 1338 – 16 September 1380), called the Wise, was King of France from 1364 to his death and a member of the House of Valois. His reign marked a high point for France during the Hundred Years' War. His armies recovered large parts of the territory that had been given to England at the Treaty of Brétigny.
