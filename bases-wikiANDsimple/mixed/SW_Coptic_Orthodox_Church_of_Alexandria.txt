The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the name for the main church in Egypt. Its churches can be found worldwide. The Church belongs to the Oriental Orthodox family of churches. It has been a separate church body since the disagreement at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 AD. The Church rejected the new definitions about what Christ is like, introduced at the Council.
The Copts believe that Christianity started in Egypt by Saint Mark the Evangelist and see him as the founder of the Coptic church.
Most Christians in Egypt are Copts.
