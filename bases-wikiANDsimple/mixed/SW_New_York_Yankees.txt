The New York Yankees are a Major League Baseball team from New York City. They have won 26 World Series championships, the most of any team in the Major Leagues. From 1923 to 2008, the Yankees home stadium had been Yankee Stadium.
The word "Yankee" (slang for "American") and the "Uncle Sam" top hat, make up part of what they are all about. As with the more common use of the term "Yankee", the team name is more often called "the Yanks". Their most commonly used "unofficial" nickname is "the Bronx Bombers", or simply "the Bombers", a nickname applied by the press a long time ago, in reference to their ability to hit home runs a lot, a home run sometimes being called a "bomb". A less used nickname is "the Pinstripers", for their well known uniform style.
The Yankees' current captain is their shortstop, Derek Jeter.
The New York Yankee's rival is the Boston Red Sox.
