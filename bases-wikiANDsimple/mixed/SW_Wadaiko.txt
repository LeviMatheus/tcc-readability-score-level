'Wa' meaning 'Japanese' and 'Taiko' meaning 'drum', 'Wadaiko' is the Japanese name given to both the act of drumming in a tradional Japanese style (of which there are many) or to the drums themselves. In a traditional Japanese village the 'Odaiko' (big drum) defined the extent of the village land. In modern Japan, wadaiko has become more of a performance art, seen only during festivals or in concert. The most famous Wadaiko performance group are 'Kodo' (meaning heart-beat). They are not only the worlds most respected Japanese drumming group, they also maintain many traditional art forms. They group lives on the island 'Sado Higashima' and live together as a community in a traditional way. Many other cultures have adopted this style of drumming, from Germany and the United States to Australia.
