The Mexican-American War took place between 1846 and 1848 between the United States of America and Mexico.
Fighting.
It is not known whether the United States or Mexico started the war. It is also not known on which side of the Rio Grande the fighting started. Both sides said that they were attacked first. Mexico said that US troops had crossed the Rio Grande and were in Mexican territory when the US troops then shot at Mexican troops. Regardless, a formal war soon followed.
In addition to small units sent to California and New Mexico, the United States sent two major armies into Mexico under the commands of General Winfield Scott and future President of the United States General Zachary Taylor.
Peace and aftermath.
The war ended with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. The treaty gave a lot of Mexican territory to the United States. Out of this land, the United States would create many states, including California, Arizona, and Utah. In return, Mexico received 15 million dollars.
The slavery debate in the United States became more intense with the addition of the new territory and the question of whether slavery would be legal in these new territories. Also, many of the officers who would lead troops in the American Civil War fought in the war and would use their experiences in the coming Civil War.
