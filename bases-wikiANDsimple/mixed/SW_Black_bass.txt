A Black bass is a type of fresh water fish.
Some names and types are "Florida bass", "Florida" (or "southern") "largemouth", "smallmouth", "green bass", "bigmouth", "bucketmouth", "linesides", "Oswego bass", and "green trout".
Description.
The largemouth is a fish which generally has greenish to brownish sides with a dark line which goes from the head to the tail. It's the largest member of the sunfish family.
Habitat.
It prefers clear, still waters with aquatic vegetation (plants that live in water). A lot of food and cover must also be there. Also, they can tolerate a wide range of water clarities and bottom types, prefer water temperatures from 20 to 30Â°C, and are usually found at depths less than 20 feet.
Feeding habits.
The feeding habits of bass change with its size. Young fish mainly feed on microscopic animals (plankton). Fingerling bass eat insects and small fishes. Adult bass will eat whatever is available, including fish, crabs, frogs, salamanders, snakes, mice, turtles, and even birds.
Age and growth - Growth rates are highly variable with differences attributed mainly to their food supply and length of growing season. Female bass live longer than males and are much more likely to reach trophy size. By age two or three, females grow much faster than male bass. At five years of age females may be twice the weight of males. The oldest bass from Florida whose age has been determined by fisheries' biologists was 16 years of age.
Sporting qualities.
The largemouth bass is a very popular fresh water game fish. Much of its popularity is due to its aggressive attitude and willingness to strike a lure or bait with explosive force. They can be caught with almost every bait. The value of the largemouth as a sport fish has prompted a movement toward catch-and-release fishing.
World record.
22 pounds, 4 ounces, caught in Montgomery Lake, Georgia (U.S. state) in 1932.
