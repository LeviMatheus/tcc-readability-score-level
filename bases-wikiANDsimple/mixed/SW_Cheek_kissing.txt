A kiss on the cheek is a way that one person can greet another, whether it's to say “we’re friends,” “good job,” “I’m sorry” or “I look up to you.” It is done by pressing ones lips on the side of another’s face, at times repeated on both cheeks, repeating one, two, three or four times. Shaking hands or hugging can also happen.
Depending on the culture it usually doesn’t mean that the kisser loves or likes the person he or she kissed in a romantic way. It is not as normal in Asia and most of North America (not including Miami and Quebec) than in Latin America and Europe, especially in Northern Europe.
