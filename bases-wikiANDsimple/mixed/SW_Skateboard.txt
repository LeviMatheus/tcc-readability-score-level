A skateboard is a board with four wheels attached to it. It used to go skateboarding.
The first skateboarders used a piece of wood with rollerskates attached to it. This became popular and by 1960, skateboards were made in production. As more skateboards were made, more people liked the new sport. However, it was dangerous and people started to fall off, hurting themselves. As a result, skateboard parks started to close down. With less places to skate, skateboarders had no where to go. A small group of skateboarders carried on skateboarding in the street and around cities. After 20 years, the sport began to grow into what we know now. Today, some older skateboarders reject the commercialization of the sport while younger skateboarders still enjoy and appreciate skateboarding.
