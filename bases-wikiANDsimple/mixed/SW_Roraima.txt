Roraima is one of the states of Brazil. It is located in the northern region of the country. It shares borders with the states of Pará and Amazonas, as well as the countries Venezuela and Guyana. Roraima is both the northernmost and least populated state of Brazil.
Geography.
The climate is tropical with an average temperature of 26°C. Most of the state is located in the Amazon rainforest. A small part of the state is a small strip of savanna to the east. The state has many mineral deposits - especially gold, diamonds, cassiterite, bauxite and copper. These create constant fights with the native population. The Yanomami are the most well-known of the native population, but they are greatly out-numbered by the Macuxi.
The Monte Roraima National Park is located around one of the highest mountains of Brazil, the 2727 m high Tepui Monte Roraima.
History.
In 1943 the Federal Government separated the area from the state Amazonas. The territory was first named Rio Branco after the main river. In 1962, it was renamed "Roraima." In 1988, it became a state. The name of the state was taken from Monte Roraima, whose name comes from the Pemon words "roroi" (cyan) and "ma" (large).
