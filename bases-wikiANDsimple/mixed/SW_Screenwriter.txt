A screenwriter is a person who writes the screenplay (or script) for a movie or television show - that is, a screenwriter writes the words that the actors and actresses speak.
A script conveys the dialogue of the movie, and will briefly describe visuals, although not too much, as this is left up to the director.
There are certain rules as to how to format a movie script. If these are not adhered to, then it is highly unlikely that it will ever be taken seriously. In order to test the effectiveness of a script, actors will do an inital reading of it. If the format is not clear, then it will probably cause the actors confusion, and will make the task very difficult to complete.
