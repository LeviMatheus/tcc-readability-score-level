Binomial expansion uses an expression to make a series. It uses a bracket expression like formula_1.
Using Pascal's triangle.
If formula_2 is an integer (formula_3), we use Pascal's triangle.
So formula_11
where formula_14 is the number at row formula_15 and position formula_16 in Pascal's triangle.
