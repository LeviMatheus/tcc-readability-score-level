Potential energy is a form of stored energy. For example, when a man brings a rock up a hill and leaves it on the hill, the rock gains gravitational potential energy. When we stretch a rubber band, we say that the rubber band has gained elastic potential energy.
Food that we eat has chemical potential energy. Batteries also have chemical potential energy.
Potential energy is divided into three different types of energy.
Gravitational Potential Energy.
Gravitational potential energy is experienced by an object when height and mass is a factor in the system. Gravitational potential energy cause objects to move towards each other.
If an object is lifted a certain distance from the surface from the Earth, the force experienced is caused by weight and height.
The Gravitational Potential Energy formula used here is only used when the objects are very near the surface of the Earth, because the acceleration must be the same during the change in height.
Electric Potential Energy.
Electric Potential Energy is experienced by charges both different and alike, as they repel or attract each other. Charges can either be positive (+) or negative (-), where opposite charges attract and similar charges repel.
Elastic Potential Energy.
Elastic Potential Energy is experienced when a rubbery material is pulled away or pushed together. The amount of potential energy the material has depends on the distance pulled or pushed. The longer the distance pushed, the greater the Elastic Potential Energy the material has.
