A folded mountain or fold mountain is created when two tectonic plates hit each other straight on. This causes them to rise out of the earth.
Folded mountains make up some of the highest mountains in the world. Folded mountains commonly form along borders, where two continents are colliding. They tend to look like an accordion. Some really complex folds can be found in parts of the Alps, Himalayas, Appalachians, and Russia's Ural Mountains. These long mountain chains also show extensive signs of folding.
Folded mountains are created when tectonic plates are pushed together slowly and continueously with pressure and heat.
