Injury means a "harm" or "hurt".
Usually an injury is when the body or a part of the body damaged by something outside of the body. Another word for injury to a body is "trauma".
Injury can be "accidental" or "intentional". Intentional injury is when someone "tries" to hurt another person. (Intentional injury is also called "non-accidental" injury) Accidental injury is when no one means to hurt someone else. An example of accidental injury is a car wreck.
