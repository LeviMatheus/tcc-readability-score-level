History.
Eritrea became an independent country on 24 May 1993. It is one of the newest countries in the world.
Many different countries have ruled the land that is now called Eritrea. Between 1885 and 1941 it was a colony of Italy. Between 1941 and 1952, the United Nations put it under the protection of United Kingdom. After 1952, Eritrea became a part of Ethiopia. This was the reason for a long civil war between the Eritreans and the government of Ethiopia.
Eventually, in 1993, Eritrea became an independent country after a vote by its people.
