A canal is a waterway made by humans. In the 1800s and 1900s, canals were built as a way of transporting heavy goods in barges. Canals usually connect lakes, rivers, or oceans. Some canals allow boats to pass. Others are used for irrigation. The Panama Canal is a famous canal that connects the Atlantic Ocean with the Pacific Ocean.
