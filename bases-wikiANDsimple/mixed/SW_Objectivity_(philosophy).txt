Detached Objectivity is a philosophical method for a person separating their own ideas and opinions from the observations they make. Objective observations are true no matter who makes the observation. Being objective helps people focus on things that everyone can agree on. In science, being objective means you study things by making some kind of measurement, so your results are based on facts and not opinions.
The opposite of objectivity is subjectivity.
