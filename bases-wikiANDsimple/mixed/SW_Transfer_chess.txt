Transfer chess (also known as Bughouse) is a version of the game, chess. It is played by four people in two teams. Each team has two players. The game is played on two chess boards. Two chess clocks can also be used. Two games of chess are played in at the same time. If a player one game captures a piece, following the regular rules of chess, they give that piece to their partner to use in the other game. The partner can put the peice on the board instead of making a normal move. Pawns can not be placed in the first or last row but other peices can be placed in any empty space. This is why the partners use opposite colored pieces.
If one player wins, that partnership wins the match. Games are usually always won by check-mating the opponent's king. Other rules can be used such as "flagfall" (which is only played when there is a clock).
