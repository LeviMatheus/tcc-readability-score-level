The German language (German: "Deutsch" or "(die) deutsche Sprache") is a West Germanic language in the Indo-European language family.
It is spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. There are minorities of German speakers in Belgium and in the Netherlands, as well as in France and Northern Italy. There are minority (small groups) speakers in many countries, including the United States and Canada, where many migrants emigrated from Germany. In East Europe, too, in Bulgaria, Romania, Russia etc
German is a part of the West Germanic language family (a group of languages that are similar) and is much like English and Dutch. A lot of the vocabulary in German is related to English, although English has a much larger vocabulary, but the grammar is more complicated. German has a system of cases, and when helping verbs are used, the main part of the verb must be moved to the end of the sentence. For example, "Someone has stolen my car" is "Jemand hat mein Auto gestohlen" (Someone has my car stolen) or, "Someone called me last night" is "Jemand hat mich letzte Nacht angerufen."
