Cruella De Vil (obviously a play on "cruel" and "devil") is the villain in the Dodie Smith book The Hundred and One Dalmatians who kidnaps (dognaps) the puppies for their fur. She is described as having one half of her hair white and the other half black, an extreme fondness for pepper and a preference for elevated temperatures.
Later, in the 1996 live-action remake, and its 2000 sequel, "102 Dalmatians", she was played by Glenn Close. Shortly afterward, Cruella was a regular viallian in ', where she was voiced by April Winchell. This time, though, she wanted to steal the Dearly Farm, seeing how killing animals for fashion was deemed politically incorrect. However, she returned to hunting dogs in "House of Mouse" (which features an ongoing joke in which she inspects dogs from other Disney movies with a measuring ruler) and ', both of which had Susanne Blakeslee as her voice.
