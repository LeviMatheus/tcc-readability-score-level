Axel Heiberg Island is the 31st biggest island in the world and Canada's 7th biggest island. According to Statistics Canada, it has an area of 43 178 km² (16,671 square miles).
The Inuit people have lived on Axel Heiberg Island in the past, but no one has lived there by the time it was named by Otto Sverdrup, who explored it around 1900. He named it after Axel Heiberg, manager of the Norwegian Ringnes brewery which sponsored the expedition. Other explorers visited the island during the early 20th century, during which time it was claimed by Norway until 1930. It is now part of Nunavut Territory, Canada.
