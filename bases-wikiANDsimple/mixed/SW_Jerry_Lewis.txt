Jerry Lewis (born Jerome Levitch, March 16, 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, USA) is an American comedian and actor. He is best known for acting in many comedy movies from the 1950s and 1960s. He also helps to raise money for people with muscular dystrophy, through the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
Lewis first became famous as part of a duo, Martin & Lewis, with singer Dean Martin. They worked together for ten years, appearing onstage, on radio and television, and in movies. They parted ways during 1956. They did not speak for years, but reunited a few times from the 1970s to the 1990s.
Besides his acting career, Lewis was also the director of many of his movies. He was the first director to use video cameras alongside movie cameras, to help with filming scenes. While film takes time to be developed, videotape could be played back instantly, saving time and work if a scene needed to be redone. Other directors soon adopted his technique, and it is still used today.
During the 1970s, Lewis's movies became less popular, and he moved away from acting and directing. In the 1990s, he returned to performing onstage, and continued to perform during the 2000s.
