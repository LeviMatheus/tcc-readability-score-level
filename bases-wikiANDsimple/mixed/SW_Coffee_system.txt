A Coffee System or Hot beverage system is a special machine for making coffee. Instead of using coffee beans or ground coffee, it uses special capsules. Each capsule has one serving of Coffee, Tea, Milk, etc in it. This makes it easy to make coffee, espresso, etc. The process is very clean. The capsules with the coffee cost more money compared to normal coffee. There is also the problem that there is more waste because of the capsule.
