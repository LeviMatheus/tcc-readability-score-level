The wristwatch (also called a "watch") is a small clock or timepiece that is attached to a person's wrist with a strap. Watches display the time and sometimes the day, date, month and year. In 1524, Peter Henlein created the first pocket watch. Before the 1900s, most watches were pocket watches which were carried in a pocket and attached to a chain.
Before the 1970s, all watches had a numbered dial with a rotating hour hand and a longer minute hand. Since the 1970s, digital watches have been available. Digital watches have small computers inside to keep the time. Instead of having a dial and hands, a digital watch shows the time as a number (e.g., 10:30 AM).
