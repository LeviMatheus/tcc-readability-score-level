A planet is a large object such as Earth or Jupiter that orbits a star. It is smaller than a star, and it does not make light. Planets are ball-shaped (spheres). Objects that orbit planets are called moons. There are eight planets in the Solar System. Pluto used to be known as a planet, but in August 2006, a group of astronomers decided it should be called a dwarf planet instead. There are four more known ice dwarfs, Ceres, Makemake, Eris and Haumea.
The name "planet" is from the Greek word πλανήτης ("planetes"), meaning "wanderers", or "things that move". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System. As of January 2007, we know of 209 other planets. All of the newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are "extrasolar" planets. Sometimes people call them "exoplanets".
In the Solar System.
The planets in the Solar System have names of Greek or Roman gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: "Terra". Other languages, for example Chinese, use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical mythology, or from the plays of Shakespeare.
Planets.
Here is a list of planets in the Solar System. They are ordered by how close they are to the Sun, nearest first.
Types of planets.
Astronomers speak about "major" (or true) planets, and minor planets, which are smaller objects that go around the Sun. Some examples of "minor planets" are asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects.
Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also "icy". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like Triton).
