Nyingma is the name of one of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. The Nyingma school is made up of several different lines that start with Padmasambhava, the legendary founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The word "Nyingma" means "ancient". Nyingma followers see themselves as holding the oldest teachings of Vajrayana. Some of these teachings come from the local BÃ¶n religion of Tibet.
Notable modern Nyingma teachers include Kyabje Dudjom Rinpoche (c. 1904-1987), Sogyal Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, Khenpo Choga Rinpoche, filmmaker Khyentse Norbu (also known as Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche), and Penor Rinpoche.
