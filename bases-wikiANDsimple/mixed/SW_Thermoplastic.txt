Thermoplastic represents a material which becomes soft when heated and hard when cooled. Thermoplastic materials can withstand several times of heating and cooling. They can be recycled. When this material is heated it melts to a liquid. It also freezes to a glassy state when cooled enough.
Thermoplastics and thermoplastic materials have many features. Some products made from thermoplastic materials are used for electronics applications. This way they protect against electrostatic discharge and radio frequency interference.
