In biology, a mutation is a change in the genetic material (usually DNA or RNA).
Mutations can happen for a lot of different reasons. It can happen because of errors during "cell division", because of radiation, chemicals or for no reason.
Mutation, together with "natural selection", is an important part of the theory of evolution.
Some mutations can be passed on to the being's offspring, and other mutations cannot.
