There are no significant buddhist communities left in Pakistan.
A few Buddhists may still exist in Pakistan Administered Kashmir (P.A.K.) and a significant community exists in Indian Occupied Kashmir to the east of the Line of Control. Mostly Ladakhi and ethnically related to Tibetans (plus a few Indo-Aryan Dards), a rough dividing line between Islamic culture and Buddhist culture can be drawn through Mulbekh and Shergol in the Indus valley (to the east of Kargil) and well to the west of Leh, the Nun Kun massif and Rangdum Buddhist monastery at the head of the Suru river valley (a tributary of the Indus) on the Indian Kashmiri side of the line of control.
See Ladakh, Indo-Occupied Kashmir for more information.
