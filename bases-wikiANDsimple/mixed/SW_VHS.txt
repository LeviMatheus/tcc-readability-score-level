VHS means Video Home System. This system uses a cassette tape to record video and sound, which can be watched on a television. A DVD/VHS combo can record(write) on VHS tapes, read off VHS tapes, and additionally, read from DVD discs.
VHS cassettes can be recorded using a video camera. They can also be recorded with a video cassette recorder, or VCR. A VCR can use a VHS cassette to record broadcasted television.
This system was created in 1976 by the Victor Company of Japan (also called JVC). VHS was a very popular way for people to record and play video at home in the 1980s and 1990s, but now DVD (or Digital Versatile Disc) has become more popular as they can store better quality video, can be easier to use, and the discs are cheaper to make. However in many less rich countries, (especially some parts of Asia) the VCD (Video CD) is often much more popular than the DVD because the disks and the player are much cheaper, and the quality is better than a VHS tape.
