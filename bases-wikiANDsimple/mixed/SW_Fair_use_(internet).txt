Fair use is used by Internet service providers who don't have data limits. (the amount someone may download) It means that the users are allowed to download as much as they want but not "non stop" (non stop = for example: the whole day)
In some countries like Belgium the Internet Service Providers still use data limits. When that amount is "crossed" (when someone used to much data) the user has to pay extra money.
