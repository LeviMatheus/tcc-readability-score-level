A storage medium is a device for recording (storing) information (data). Recording can be done using virtually any form of energy.
A storage device may hold information, process information, or both. A device that only holds information is a recording medium.
"Electronic data storage" is storage which requires electrical power to store and get back that data. Most storage devices that do not require visual optics to read data fall into this category. Electronic data may be stored in either an analog or digital signal format.
Terminology.
An organic brain may or may not be considered a data storage device.
All information is data. However, not all data is information.
Recording medium.
A recording medium is a physical material that holds data expressed in any of the existing recording formats. With electronic media, the data and the recording medium is sometimes referred to as "software" despite the more common use of the word to describe computer software.
