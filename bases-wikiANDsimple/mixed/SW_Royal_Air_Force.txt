The Royal Air Force (RAF is a short version) is the air force of the United Kingdom. The RAF was started in 1918. Before it was called the Royal Air Force it was called the Royal Flying Corps (spoken as 'core'). The RAF have many bases across the world, including the UK, Falkland Islands, Cyprus and Gibraltar. Some examples of the UK bases are RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland, RAF Valley in Wales, RAF Aldergrove in Northern Ireland and RAF Linton-on Ouse in England. The RAF has very new planes including the Eurofighter Typhoon, Panavia Tornado and the BaE Hawk. The Hawk is used to train fast-jet pilots.
World War II.
The RAF was very busy during World War II. A lot of important planes were built for the RAF during that time. The Spitfire, Hawker Hurricaine and Avro Lancaster bomber. Sadly the RAF lost a lot of pilots which were shot down by the enemy.
