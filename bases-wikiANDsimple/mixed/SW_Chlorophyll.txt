Chlorophyll is a chemical found in the chloroplasts of plants that allows the plant to absorb light.
This light is used in photosynthesis to make glucose. This contains lots of stored energy which the plant needs to release. It does this through respiration. This energy is then used for lots of different things like growing or repairing damaged parts of the plant.
