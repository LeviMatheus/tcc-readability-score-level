"Sometimes called the CSA, for other uses see CSA"
The Confederate States of America was a short-lived country that existed in southeastern North America during the American Civil War. It was established in 1861 when the southern states of South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas left the United States of America to make their own government. Later Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina joined them.
Their government was much like the United States of America's government, and it had a similar constitution. The United States government (also known as the Union) didn't agree that the states could leave and start a new government, and so the two countries went to war. This war is known as the American Civil War, and it lasted from 1861 to 1865.
When the Civil War ended in 1865, the United States regained control of the southern states, and the Confederate States of America fell apart. Even today, many people argue about if the Confederate States of America was really a country. The Union never agreed that the Confederacy was really a country, and because the Confederacy had slavery, none of the countries in Europe ever agreed that the Confederacy was a country either, except for the Duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (part of what is now Germany). Because the name "Civil War" means a war being fought by the people in one country, people sometimes call the American Civil War "the War Between the States".
The CSA was also called "the South", and the states that were once part of it continue to sometimes be called "the South."
