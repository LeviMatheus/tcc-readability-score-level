Heliopolis was one of the oldest cities of Egypt. Its name also refers (in European languages) to a modern suburb of Cairo. The ancient city stood five miles east of the Nile north of the apex of the Delta. The modern city of Heliopolis is in a different place. In ancient times it was the main city of sun-worship.
