The Gilmore Girls was an American television series. It was about a single mother Lorelai Victoria Gilmore (Lauren Graham) and her teenage daughter Lorelai “Rory” Leigh Gilmore (Alexis Bledel). They lived together in a fictional small town called Stars Hollow, Connecticut. The show aired on television from October 5, 2000 until May 15, 2007. Gilmore Girls was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino. She also acted as the executive producer during the first six series with her husband Daniel Palladino. The show first aired on The WB network and moved to the CW network when the WB merged with UPN.
Gilmore Girls was a one hour drama. It had very witty storylines that explored family, generational divides, love, and friendship. It had the makings of a comedy because of the fast paced dialogue, the wild references and sense of humour that was in the program. Gilmore Girls was set in Stars Hollow, a fictional town where everyone knew each other and many strange types of people walked the streets.
