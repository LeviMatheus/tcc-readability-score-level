The decapods or Decapoda are an order of crustaceans within the class Malacostraca. Many familiar groups, such as crayfish, crabs, lobsters, prawns and shrimp can be found in this order. Most decapods are scavengers - they eat dead plants and animals.
Anatomy.
As their name suggests, all decapods have ten legs. These are the last five of the eight pairs of thoracic legs characteristic of crustaceans. The front three pairs are used as jaws and are called maxillipeds. The others are pereiopods (walking legs). In many decapods, however, one pair of legs has large pinching claws; the claws are called "chelae", so those legs may be called "chelipeds". More legs are found on the abdomen. Each segment can carry a pair of two-branched pleopods (swimming legs). The last of them form part of the tail fan and are called uropods.
Classification.
Classification within the order Decapoda depends on the structure of the gills and legs, and the way in which the larvae develop. This allows to split them into two suborders: Dendrobranchiata and Pleocyemata. Prawns (including many species informally referred to as "shrimp", such as the Atlantic white shrimp) make up the Dendrobranchiata. The other groups, including true shrimp, are the Pleocyemata.
The following classification follows Martin and Davis, with some changes based on more recent structural and molecular studies.
