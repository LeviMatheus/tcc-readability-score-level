A Ritual (or a "Rite") is a set of actions people do. In a ritual, the actions are important for their symbolic significance. Every action stands for a particular thing. Rituals are always done in the same way.
Very often, rituals have a religious significance. They mark a passage or a change. Danger might be involved in carrying out the ritual.
Through a certain ritual, a boy might show that he is now a man, for example.
When the ritual has been performed successfully, it is usually followed by a celebration.
