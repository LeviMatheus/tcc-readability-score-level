Nintendo 64 was the third video game console released by Nintendo. It was released in 1996 and 1997, and was meant to compete against the Sony PlayStation and the Sega Saturn. The Nintendo 64 was Nintendo's first console with 3D graphics. It uses plastic cartridges instead of CDs or disks, making load times faster. However, because of this, the games costed more to make. The controller for the Nintendo 64 was shaped like an "M" and had 10 buttons and a joystick. Sony used the joystick design to make their DualShock PlayStation controller.
Because making games for the Nintendo 64 was more expensive than making games for the PlayStation, many video game companies did not develop games for the 64, and made them for the PlayStation instead. Nintendo also did not like games that had a lot of blood or violence in them, so companies who made these kinds of games made them for the PlayStation instead. Nintendo lost its lead over Sega and Sony because of these two things.
