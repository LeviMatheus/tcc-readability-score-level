"Sir" Muhammad Iqbal (Urdu: محمد اقبال) born (November 9, 1877 – April 21, 1938) was a Muslim poet, philosopher and politician born in Sialkot, British India (now in Pakistan). He wrote poetry in Urdu and Persian languages. This poetry is considered to be among the greatest of the modern era. His vision of an independent state for the Muslims of British India was to inspire the creation of Pakistan. He is commonly referred to as Allama Iqbal (علامہ اقبال‎, Allama lit. Scholar.)
In 1930, he gave a speech where he thought that a state should be created in the northwest of India, for the Muslims living in India.
