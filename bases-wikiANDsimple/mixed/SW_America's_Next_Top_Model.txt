Overview.
A group of contestants (10 in Cycle 1, 12 in Cycle 2, 13 in Cycle 5 to 9, 14 in Cycle 3, 4, 10 and 11) are chosen to live together in the Top Model House and compete to become America's Next Top Model. Each week, one girl is asked to leave (called 'elimination') because she does not have the standard and ability to become a top model. The elimination is based on a photoshoot or a commercial and the reward challenge different every week. When half the girls are gone, the other half will take an aeroplane to another country to continue (France, Italy, Japan, China, Thailand etc.) the competition. Once there are three girls, they will do a CoverGirl commercial. Then, two girls are left to appear in a final runway show against each other. The winner is then chosen with help of the group of judges - Tyra Banks (supermodel), Nigel Barker (photographer), Jay Alexander (runway coach), Twiggy (top model) and sometimes, Jay Manuel (make-up artist).
