The San Jacinto Fault Zone is a series of faults that run through Southern California. It is said to be a sister fault of the older, much more famous San Andreas Fault. Some cities that are directly on the fault zone include San Bernardino, San Jacinto, and Hemet. This fault could create a large earthquake that could greatly affect Greater Los Angeles.
