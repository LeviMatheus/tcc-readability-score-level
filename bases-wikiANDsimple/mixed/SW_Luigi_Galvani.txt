Luigi Galvani (September 9, 1737 â€“ December 4, 1798) was an Italian physician who lived and died in Bologna. In 1771, he found out that the muscles of dead frogs twitched when hit by a spark. He was a pioneer in modern obstetrics, and discovered that muscle and nerve cells produce electricity. He is well known as the inventor of chemical cells.
