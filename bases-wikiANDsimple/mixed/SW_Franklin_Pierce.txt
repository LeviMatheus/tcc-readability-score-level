Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804 - October 8, 1896) was the 14th President of the United States. A Democrat, he took office in 1853 and served one four-year term. He believed that each state should choose whether the state should allow slavery; his presidency was marked with violence sparked by the Kansas Nebraska Act. In addition, a political scandal damaged his credibility when the Ostend Manifesto was publicized.
Pierce was a dark horse candidate in the 1852 presidential election. Before running for president, he came from New Hampshire and had served in the House of Representatives.
Pierce is widely regarded as one of the worst U.S. presidents ever because of his inability to lower tensions before the American Civil War.
