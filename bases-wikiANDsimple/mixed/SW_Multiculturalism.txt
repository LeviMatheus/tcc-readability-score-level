Multiculturalism is a word that describes a society where many different cultures live together.
In a multicultural society, there is not an official (decided by the people in charge) culture that every person must be a part of. Instead, all cultures are respected as much as each other.
In general, a multicultural society is formed when people from many different countries all migrate to one place.
