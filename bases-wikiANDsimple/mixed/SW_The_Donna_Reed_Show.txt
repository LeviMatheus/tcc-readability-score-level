"The Donna Reed Show" was an American situation comedy. It aired on ABC network from 1958 to 1966. It starred Donna Reed as Donna Stone, a housewife to Doctor Alex Stone, played by Carl Betz. The couple had two children together, Mary and Jeff.
The series was fairly normal for a situation comedy. The focus of the series was on parenting problems. The lovelives and activities of the children were also a main part of the series. The series was very unusual at the time because Donna would help solve the children's problems alone while Alex worked. It was also unique because Donna often worked as a nurse, at a time when most television mothers were housewives.
