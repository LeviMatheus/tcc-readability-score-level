The Algonquian (also Algonquin, Algonkian) languages are a subfamily of Native American languages that includes most of the languages in the Algic language family The term "Algonquin" comes from the Maliseet word "elak√≥mkwik" (), "they are our relatives/allies". Many Algonquian languages are extremely endangered today, while a number of others have already died out completely.
Speakers of Algonquian languages stretch from the east coast of North America all the way to the Rocky Mountains. The language from which all of the languages of the family come from, was spoken at least 3,000 years ago.
