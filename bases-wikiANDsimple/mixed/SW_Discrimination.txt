Discrimination is literally when something or someone is distinguished from someone or something. Discrimination against is when a person is treated unfairly or badly because of something about that person.
A person might be discriminated "against" because of their race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, the way they look, a past criminal record, the person's lifestyle, their choice of clothing, their age, whether they are a member of or fit in with a social clique (group), social class or caste, and many other reasons.
Discrimination "against" can take many forms. It can include being fired from a job, not being able to be hired for a job, being paid less money than others at the same job, being refused a home or apartment, teasing, harassment, or simply being treated differently than other people. A law was introduced called Equal Opportunities, which promises not to employ someone because of their race, age, sex or religion. Two people in the same position must be paid the same wage if they have identical responsibilities.
In some countries, discrimination on the basis of race, sex, or religion is illegal for jobs or housing. Even in those countries where discrimination is against the law, it still takes place for other reasons not covered by the law. In some other countries, discrimination is legal or even official government policy. This is especially so in countries in which there is an official religion, and people of other religions are discriminated against. Discrimination is also widespread in countries which have a culture in which castes or social classes are widely recognized.
