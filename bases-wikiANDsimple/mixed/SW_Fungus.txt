A Fungus (plural: Fungi) is a kind of living organism which is not a plant or an animal or a protist or a eubacteria or an archaebacteria. In the past, people thought fungi were plants. Some fungi are mushrooms, moulds and yeasts. A fungus breaks down the dead matter around it and uses it as food.
Reproduction.
Fungi reproduce sexually and asexually. Some fungi grow mushrooms (fruiting bodies), which have gills which make spores that will be used to make new fungi.
Fugal states.
Two fungal states exist: the unicellular or "yeast" form and the mycelial form.
Yeast form.
The yeast form is single-celled and reproduction occurs by simple budding or binary fission.
Mycelial form.
The mycelial form is the vegetative growth of filaments.
