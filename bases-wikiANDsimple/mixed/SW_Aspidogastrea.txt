The Aspidogastrea (gr. "aspid" - shield, "gaster" - stomach/pouch) is a small group of flukes. There are about 80 species. The group is a subclass of the Trematoda, and sister group to the Digenea. Species are between approximately one mm to several cm long. They are parasites of freshwater and marine molluscs and vertebrates (cartilaginous and bony fishes and turtles). Maturation may occur in the mollusc or vertebrate host. None of the species has any economic importance, but the group is of very great interest to biologists because it has several characters which appear to be archaic.
