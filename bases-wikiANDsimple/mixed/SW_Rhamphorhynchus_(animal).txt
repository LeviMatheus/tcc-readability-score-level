The Rhamphorhynchus was a small pterosaur. It mostly ate fish, insects, and frogs. It had a small diamond shaped rudder on the end of its tail which helped keep it stable when it was flying. "Rhamphorhynchus" had many long, sharp teeth and it also had a beak that was covered with horn. The nostrils were set back in the beak. It had large eyes and an enormous skull. Rhamphorhynchus had no feathers, but it did have fur, which is why it is believed to have been warm-blooded. It was about 7 in. to 6 feet long. Most of the Rhamphorhynchus species was fairly small, though. Rhamphorhynchus babies hatched from eggs. Rhamphorhynchus was not a dinosaur, though closely related to it.
