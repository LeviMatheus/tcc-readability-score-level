A month is an amount of time used with calendars. It is about one twelfth of a year. It is a little longer than a natural period of the moon 29.53 days. In some cultures, the idea for months came from moon phases. People have counted days based on moon phases for a very long time. Some calendars are still strongly based on the moon, or "lunar calendars".
Others, called "solar calendars", ignore the moon, and depend entirely on the Sun â€” for example, the Gregorian calendar of 365 or 366 days (twelve months) used in much of the world today.
