Big Ben is the name of a thirteen ton bell that rings in the clock tower at the northern end of the Houses of Parliament in Westminster, London, England. Officially, the tower itself is called the Clock Tower, Palace of Westminster. However, most people, including those that live in London, call the tower "Big Ben."
Big Ben is the second bell in the tower. The first was damaged in 1856, due to a miscalculation.
