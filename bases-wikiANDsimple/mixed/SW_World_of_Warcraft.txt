' was a real-time strategy game. So were "Warcraft 2" and its successor, ' and "Warcraft 3" and its successor, '. World of Warcraft is different than the other games because it is a MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Game). This means that many people from around the world play at once in the online world.
Players move through the game by gaining items from killing bosses and finish quests that are given throughout the game.
World of Warcraft has developed a community of 'raiding guilds' that compete with each other for 'first kills' on bosses in new raid instances, dungeons that require 25 players to work together to take down really hard bosses.
Races.

Classes.
In the game, there are classes. Once a player has picked it cannot change. When one chooses a class at a certain level (10) each level up one gets one talent point to be put into a spot in the Talent Trees.
For example, if someone is a priest and he or she wants to cause damage to others, he or she goes down the shadow tree, and if they wants to heal themselves or a friend, he or she goes down the holy tree, or the discipline tree to reduce their damage.
