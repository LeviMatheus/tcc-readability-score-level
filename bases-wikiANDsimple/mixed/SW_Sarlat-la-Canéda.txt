Sarlat-la-Canéda (often just called Sarlat) is a city in France. It is in the Dordogne departement in Aquitaine. In 1999, 9.707 people lived there. The city developped around a benedictine abbey in the 13th century. The abbey already existed in the 9th century. it was part of the six great abbeys of the Périgord. The others were Paunat, Belvès, Saint Front de Périgueux, Brantôme and Terrasson). The carolingian abbey was the only one to be spared by the Vikings. This is because it does not lie on the river Dordogne or its tributaries. In 1317, Sarlat became the seat of a bishop.
The city was badly damaged in the Hundred years' war. After several conflicts it was rebuilt in renaissance style between 1450 and 1500. In the middle of the 17th century the city lost political influence, it also became poorer.
In 1963 a law was passed to save the old medieval city centres. There were refurbishing works from 1964 to 1974. Today, the city is a magnet for tourists. About a million people visit it each year.
