The Ford Mustang is a very popular American small car. It was introduced to the public in 1964 by the Ford Motor Company. It did not cost a lot of money, but it was still very fancy. People could order their Mustang with many options and body styles, such as a convertible, 2+2 (fastback), or coupe. Many different engines were available between the years of 1964 1/2 to 1968; from the 170 CID to the 427 CID engine. This meant car buyers could have a Mustang that saved gas or a more powerful and fast car. More than one million Mustangs were sold in only two years. The Mustang is still being sold today and is still very popular.
The 1964 Mustang was based on another Ford car, the Falcon. The Falcon was not expensive to build and that helped the Mustang get the approval it needed to be built. The people who ran the Ford company didn't want to take a chance on a car like that because they lost a lot of money on another car, the Edsel, just a few years back. The Mustang sold very well, becoming one of the best sellng cars of all time. It would remain mostly the same until 1966.
Its first new body style came out in 1967 and its third by 1969. Bigger, more powerful engines were offered, making some Mustangs into musclecars. By 1971, the Mustang had become a very large car and sales were dropping.
A new Mustang came out in 1974. Called "Mustang II," it was almost the same size as the original car, but emissions controls and the Arab oil embargo meant that the Mustang II was not a very powerful car, even with a V-8 engine. It was also a heavier car than the 1964-66 model.
The new Mustang that came out in 1979 may have been the most important Mustang ever. The basic design carried all the way through the 2004 model year, but with hundreds of thousands of improvements over the years. Very few parts except for some minor chassis parts stayed unchanged. The new 2005 model is the first all-new Mustang since 1979. Because the original Mustang was and is one of the most popular cars ever, Ford made the new Mustang to look very much like the first Mustangs, especially the 1967 and 1968 models. Ford and Carol Shelby recently reintroduced the GT-500 version of the Mustang. Carol Shelby played a critical role in the development of the GT-500
in the 60's, and he also played a crucial role in the development of the Mach 1. Both models are around today and offer mustang buyer's the choice of having superior quality and performance.
