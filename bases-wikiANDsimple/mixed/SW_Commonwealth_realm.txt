A Commonwealth realm is a country which has the same monarch as the United Kingdom.
The queen appoints a Governor-General to represent her. The Governor-General is appointed after consulting with the government of the realm, and has all of the powers and duties of the queen. Usually the Governor-General signs all acts of parliament into law, but can wait and ask the queen for advice or wait for her to sign the act herself. This happened in 1982 when Queen Elizabeth signed the important "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms" during a visit to Canada.
Although the British Queen is also queen of the Commonwealth realms the British government has no power in the realms. The only exception was the British North America Act of 1867 which controlled the powers of the federal government in Canada. Because the provinces of Canada were worried about the power of the federal government only the British government and parliament could change the act until Britain and Canada agreed to the "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms" in 1982.
Each realm decides on the Queen's title.
Usually it is Queen of (realm) and Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.
Not all countries use the title "Defender of the Faith".
