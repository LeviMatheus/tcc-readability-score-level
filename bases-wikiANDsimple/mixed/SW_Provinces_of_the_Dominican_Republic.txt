The Dominican Republic has thirty-one (31) provinces (in Spanish, "provincias"). The President of the Republic appoints a Civil Governor ("Gobernador Civil") in every province. The only function of the Governor is to represent the President of the Republic in the province.
The people who live in the province elect one Senator ("Senador") and at least two (2) Representatives ("Diputados") for the National Congress.
The National District ("Distrito Nacional") is similar to a province but without a Civil Governor and with only one municipality, Santo Domingo de Guzm√°n, the national capital.
There are two (2) or more municipalities (in Spanish and in singular, "municipio") in every province. The municipalities are governed by municipal councils and mayors elected by popular vote. The municipal districts (in Spanish and in singular, "distrito municipal") are subdivisions of some municipalities ruled by a municipal council and a mayor named by the municipality to which they belong.
The Dominican Republic has 154 municipalities and 202 municipal districts.
The following is a table of the provinces and their capital cities. Population figures in the following table are from the 2002 census.
