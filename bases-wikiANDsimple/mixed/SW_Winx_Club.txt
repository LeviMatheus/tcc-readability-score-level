The Winx Club is an animated series starring six girls (Bloom, Layla, Tecna, Flora, Musa, and Stella) who can use magic. The girls have to fight Icy, Darcy, and Stormy who are witches who were kicked out of Cloud Tower. Together with their principal, Miss Faragonda, they learn to tap into their magical abilities called "Winx" and defeat their enemies. In the middle of the third season, all six of the "Winx Club" girls have their "Enchantix". This means they become full-fledged fairies. They have to earn their "Enchantix" by saving someone from their own "Relm" when they are in trouble.
