Infinity, also written formula_1, is larger than any number that can possibly be imagined. The term is from a Latin word meaning "without end".
Infinity is really not a number, but it is sometimes used as one. Numbers can be counted, but infinity cannot be counted. Now, people are proposing that infinity is just an abstract concept.
Infinity can be broken up in two different kinds; potential and actual infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is something that we cannot imagine or put a value on in our system of concepts.
