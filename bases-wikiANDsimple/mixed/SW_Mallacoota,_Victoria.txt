History.
The Bidawal Aborigines lived there before Europeans came. Europeans came after about 1830. Gold was found in 1894, and was mined for three years. In the 20th century the logging, farming and fishing industries declined, and the tourism and abalone industries grew. The town's largest business, the abalone co-operative, was started in 1967.
