Greenhouse gases reflect radiation from the Earth and stop it from being lost into space. This causes the Earth's temperature to be warmer than it would be without greenhouse gases. The name for this is the "greenhouse effect."
Most greenhouse gases are natural - water vapour is the most common, and causes most of the greenhouse effect on Earth. Other greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. A natural greenhouse effect is not bad. Without greenhouse gases, the earth would be 15 to 30 degrees Celcius colder, and life would probably not be possible here.
However, humans are adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Scientists believe that this has caused the planet's average temperature to rise. The most important greenhouse gas that humans add to the atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is released when people burn fossil fuels, like oil, coal, and natural gas.
In addition to burning fossil fuels, human beings add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by cutting down trees. They also add methane to the atmosphere by raising cattle.
