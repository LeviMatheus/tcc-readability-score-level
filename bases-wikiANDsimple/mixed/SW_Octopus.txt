Octopus (plural octopuses) is a kind of mollusc. Octopuses live in many places in the ocean, especially in coral reefs. There are many different types of octopuses, but they all have eight arms.
Nutrition.
They eat mostly fish and small crabs. Some species of octopuses also eat other octopuses. The octopus is also called the devil fish. It has a special ink pouch that it uses to darken the water when it feels like it is in danger.
Many biologists think they are the most intelligent of the invertebrate animals.
Structure.
Unlike most other cephalopods, most octopuses have only soft body with no internal skeleton. They have no protective outer shell like the nautilus, which is another type of animal. What is more, they have no sign of an internal shell or bone, like cuttlefish or squid.
A beak, similar in shape to a parrot's beak, is their only hard part.
Because of this, it is very easy for an octopus to squeeze through very narrow openings between rocks. An octopus has three hearts.The octopus is capable of squeezing through a hole as big as his eye, this gives an idea about how flexible and slippery this animal can be.
