Asian Dust (also yellow dust, yellow sand, yellow wind, or China dust storms) is a weather occurrence that happens each year. It affects much of East Asia during the spring. The dust comes from deserts in Mongolia, northern China, and Kazakhstan. The dust comes from surface winds and dust storms in the desert. The clouds are carried by eastward winds to China, Japan, east Russia and the Koreas. Smaller particles in the clouds can travel much further to places like the United States. In the last ten years, these dust storms have become a serious problem because they have picked up industrial pollutants. The dust storms in China have been called "yellow dust terrorism".
