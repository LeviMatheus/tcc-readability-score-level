History.
The first Oktoberfest was on 12 October 1810. The feast was for the wedding of King Ludwig I of Bavaria and Therese of Sachsen-Hildeburghausen. The feast lasted for 5 days. There was music, and you could eat and drink. At the end of it there was a big horse-race. The next years they organized this horse-race and the feast again, because the people had liked it so much.
