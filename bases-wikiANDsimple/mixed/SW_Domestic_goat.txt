The domestic goat ("Capra hircus" or "Capra aegagrus hircus") is a domesticated mammal. It comes from the Wild Goat.
A male goat is called a "buck" or "billy", a female is called a "doe" or "nanny". Young goats are called "kids".
People eat their meat and drink their milk, because people say that it is very good. With goat milk, cheese can be made, along with other dairy products. Some farmers use goats to control bad plants, called weeds.
