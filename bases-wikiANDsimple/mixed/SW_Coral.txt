Coral is a group of many similar types of very small animals that live in the ocean. Coral live together in colonies. Each new generation of a coral colony lives on the skeletons of other coral. By doing this over time, Coral forms into a reef. This reef is alive on the outside, and rock-like on the inside.
Coral is usually found in warm water like that found around Indonesia, but some type of coral can be found as far north as the very cold waters around Norway. The word comes from a Greek word, "korallion". Coral mostly eat small plankton, but they sometimes eat small fish.
