A logarithmic scale is a scale of measurement that uses the logarithm of a physical quantity instead of the quantity itself.
The logarithmic scale can be helpful when the data covers a large range of values – the logarithm reduces this to a more manageable range.
Some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (doubling the input strength adds a constant to the subjective signal strength, see: Stevens' power law). That makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular our sense of hearing perceives equal ratios of frequencies as equal differences in pitch.
On most logarithmic scales, "small" values (or ratios) of the underlying quantity correspond to "small" (possibly negative) values of the logarithmic measure.
Graphic representation.
A logarithmic scale is also a graphical scale on one or both sides of a graph where a number "x" is printed at a distance "c"·log("x") from the point marked with the number 1. A slide rule has logarithmic scales, and nomograms often employ logarithmic scales. On a logarithmic scale an equal difference in order of magnitude is represented by an equal distance. The geometric mean of two numbers is midway between the numbers.
Logarithmic graph paper, before the advent of computer graphics, was a basic scientific tool. Plots on paper with one log scale can show up exponential laws, and on log-log paper power laws, as straight lines (see semilog graph, log-log graph).
