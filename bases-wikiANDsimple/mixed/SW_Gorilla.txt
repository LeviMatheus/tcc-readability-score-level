A Gorilla is an ape of the genus "Gorilla". It is the biggest member of the primate order. It lives in Africa. The Gorillas' habitats (living places) are being wiped out by forest cutting for wood. Gorillas will not usually attack but if provoked become very aggressive.
Appearance.
Gorillas are the biggest primates. They can become very heavy, and are very strong. They have black skin and fur. Male gorillas' fur becomes silver/grey on their backs as they become older. Because of that older males are called silverbacks.
Life.
Gorillas live in the (rain)forests in central Africa. They mostly live on the ground, but they can also climb. When on the ground, they walk on their feet and finger knuckles. They are mostly herbivores, and eat leaves and fruit.
After a pregnancy of 8Â½ - 9 months the female gives birth to usually one baby. It stays with its mother for 3-4 years. Gorillas can live for up to 50 years.
