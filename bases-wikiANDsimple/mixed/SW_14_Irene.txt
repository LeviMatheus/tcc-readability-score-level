14 Irene is a very big Main belt asteroid.
14 Irene was found by J. R. Hind on May 19, 1851, and named after Eirene, a personification of peace in Greek mythology. She was one of the Horae, daughter of Zeus and Themis. The name was suggested by Sir John Herschel. Hind wrote,
The "Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations" in the Crystal Palace of Hyde Park, London ran from May 1 until October 18, 1851.
Hind suggested that the symbol for the asteroid should be "A dove carrying an olive-branch, with a star on its head", but an actual drawing of the symbol was never made before the use of graphical symbols to represent asteroids was no longer used.
There have been four reported stellar occultations by Irene.
