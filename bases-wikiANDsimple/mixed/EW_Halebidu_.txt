Halebidu (IAST: Haḷēbīḍ, also Halebeedu or Halebid, literally "old capital, encampment") is a town located in Hassan District, Karnataka, India. Halebidu (which used to be called Dorasamudra or Dwarasamudra) was the regal capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 12th century CE. It is home to some of the best examples of Hoysala architecture. Most notable are the ornate Hoysaleshwara and Kedareshwara temples. The city got the name "Halebidu" because it was damaged and deserted into "old capital" after being ransacked and looted twice by forces of the Delhi Sultanate in the 14th century.
The town is known for its temple complexes:
Halebidu is connected by road and rail to Hassan (30 km), Mysore (150 km) and Mangalore (184 km). It is close to Belur, known for its Vaishnavite Hindu temples.
