Air New Zealand Flight 901 was a scheduled passenger flight that crashed into Mount Erebus on November 28, 1979. It was a sightseeing flight to Antarctica that should have flown from Auckland, New Zealand, and back.
The flight's route had been adjusted without the crew's knowledge shortly before the crash. Because the weather conditions of the Arctic were so bad (severely limiting visibility), and the crew believed they were following the original flight plan, the plane crashed straight into Mount Erebus. Nobody survived.
