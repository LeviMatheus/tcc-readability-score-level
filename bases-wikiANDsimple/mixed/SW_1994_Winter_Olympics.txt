The 1994 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVII Olympic Winter Games, were celebrated in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway. Other possible host cities were Anchorage, Alaska, USA; Östersund/Åre, Sweden; and Sofia, Bulgaria. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee voted to change the schedule of the Olympic Games so that the summer and winter games would be arranged in alternating even-numbered years. Lillehammer won the right to host the event in September 1988 in Seoul before the opening ceremony of the 1988 Summer Olympics. The Lillehammer Games were held in 1994, the only time the Winter Games have occurred two years after the previous games.
The Lillehammer Olympics are thought by sport specialists and Olympic officials to be one of the greatest Winter Games ever, and it is among the greatest sporting events in history. It is notable for being the last Winter Olympic Games to date to have been held in a town (Lillehammer's population is just 25,000), rather than the large cities which have held the more recent Winter Olympic Games.
