The California Golden Seals were an ice hockey team in the NHL that played from 1966 to 1976. The Golden Seals entered the league at the start of the 1966-67 NHL season as the Oakland Seals. In the 1970-71 season, the team was renamed to the California Golden Seals. Due to poor attendance, the Golden Seals' owners moved to the team to Cleveland, where they became known as the Barons.
