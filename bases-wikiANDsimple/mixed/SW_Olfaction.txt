Olfaction is the sense of smell. The sense of smell is how a man or animal notices a smell (or odor) by using the nose. Animals have much better noses than people. Animals can detect small particles in the air or sometimes water that people can not.
Less Simple.
People have special cells in the nose that can detect some chemicals. These cells are called olfactory epithelium. All vertebrates have these cells. The smell is first processed by the olfactory bulb in the olfactory system. Then this information is given to the brain.
In insects, smells are sensed by sensilia on the antennae and first processed by the antennal lobe.
