Bad Doberan is a district in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Germany.
In the Middle Ages the region was made rich because Hanseatic city of Rostock was close. Today the city of Rostock is surrounded by the district, but not a part of it.
In 1793 the bathing resort of Heiligendamm (today a borough of Bad Doberan) was started, and the region became a summer residence for the dukes of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
In 1952 the districts of Bad Doberan and Rostock-Land were made. They were joined in 1994 to make the present district.
