"8 Eyes" is a 1988 video game created by Thinking Rabbit for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game has eight levels in it, and can be played by one or two players. In the game, a soundtrack, composed by Kenzou Kumei, had three songs for each of the eight levels, each set in a different part of the world. It has almost the same gameplay and graphics to "Castlevania". The name of the main character of the game is Orin, and he looks like Simon Belmont from the Castlevania games.
