Sperm are the male reproductive cells. Most animals and plants use sperm to reproduce. They have different ways of making and releasing the sperm. In all cases the sperm meet with the egg of a female and grow into a new organism.
The name sperm is taken from the greek word "sperma" meaning "seed".
Anatomy.
An animal sperm cell is capable of movement, as it has to get to the uterus to meet with the ovum. Animal sperm cells (including humans) have small 'head' and a long tail called a "flagellum". The flagellum acts like a motor to propel the sperm cell through the female reproductive system.
A plant sperm cell is "non motive", it can't move by itself. Plant sperm cells are contained within the pollen of a plant. They reach other plants through the wind, or insects such as bees.
In humans.
Human sperm is made in the testicles of a man. Human sperm contains 23 chromosomes. A human needs 46 chromosomes, so a sperm cell is called a "haploid" as it only has half. The other half is contained within the ovum or egg of a female. During sex, semen is shot out of the man's penis during ejaculation.
Semen carries the sperm into the womans vagina and down to the ovum in the uterus. During ejaculation millions of sperm cells are released, but only one hundred or so reach the egg.
If or when one does reach the egg, the two cells merge. Because they now have 46 chromosomes, they are called a "diploid". Thiis diploid turns into a zygote, which can grow into a fetus and eventually a baby.
In plants.
Plant sperm cells cannot move by themselves. Plant sperm cells are contained within a sticky liquid called pollen,
They rely on "transportation" to take their sperm cells to other plants. For example a bee lands on a plant to collect the pollen. Some pollen wil get stuck to the bee. The bee moves on to another plant and the pollen falls onto that plant. The pollen falls down a "pollen tube" until it reaches the ovule at the bottom.
