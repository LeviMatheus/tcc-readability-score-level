The Paleolithic (or Palaeolithic) is a prehistoric era distinguished by the development of the first stone tools. It covers the greatest portion of humanity's time (roughly 99% of human history) from 2.5 or 2.6 million years ago, with the introduction of stone tools by hominids such as "Homo habilis", to the introduction of agriculture and the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000Â BC. The Paleolithic era ended with the Mesolithic, in Western Europe, and in areas not effected by the Ice age with the Epipaleolithic (such as Africa).
During the Paleolithic humans were grouped together in small scale societies such as bands and made their living by gathering plants and hunting wild animals.
At the time, humans used stone, wood and bone tools as well as leather and vegetable fibers. But the last two were not preserved till our time.
Chronology of Paleolithic and the following periods.
Traditionally, the Paleolithic is divided into three (somewhat overlapping) periods: the Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic, and the Upper Paleolithic. The three ages mark technological and cultural advances in different human communities.
After the Paleolithic follow Mesolithic and Neolithic, which marks the end of Stone Age. Then follow Bronze Age and Iron Age.
