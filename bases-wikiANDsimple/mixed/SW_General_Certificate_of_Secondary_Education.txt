The General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) is a set of exams taken in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and other British territories. They are usually taken by students aged 16 after two years of study. Some students can take their exams early if their teachers think them able. Most students taking their GCSE study nine or ten subjects.
All students have to study English, Mathematics and Science until they are 16, but they do not have to take the GCSE exams.
Most schools require that a student passes 5 or more GCSE exams at grades C or above before they can move on to study A-levels.
