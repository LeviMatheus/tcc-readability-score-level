The Master Sword is a sword found in The Legend of Zelda series. Link uses it as a sword to damage enemies.
Known as the Sword of Evil's Bane, the Master Sword is to only be held by a person destined to be the Hero of Time. Link in The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is supposedly the first holder of the Master Sword. The other incarnations of Link are then given the right to wield the Master Sword due to those incarnations being in the bloodline of the Knights of Legend.
