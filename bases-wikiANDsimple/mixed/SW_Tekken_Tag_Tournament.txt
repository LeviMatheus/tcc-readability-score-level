"Tekken Tag Tournament" is an update to Tekken 3. It has most of the characters from Tekken 1, Tekken 2 and Tekken 3. It was released on the PS2 in 2000.
Story.
Tekken Tag Tournament has no story so that makes it non-canonical.
Characters.
Marshall Law, the Jack robot from the original "Tekken" game, the first King, the first Kuma, and Doctor Boskonovitch, as well as Gon, the manga character who appeared in the PlayStation version of "Tekken 3", were not included as characters in "Tekken Tag Tournament". However, Doctor Boskonovitch makes a cameo in the Tekken Bowling minigame.
New characters.
If the player chooses Kazuya and Devil on the same Tag Team, Kazuya will transform into Devil (and vice-versa) instead of them tagging.
