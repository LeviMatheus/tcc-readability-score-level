Aurora was the ancient Roman equivalent of Eos. Eos was the ancient Greek goddess of the dawn. "Aurora" is the Latin word for dawn.
Aurora renews herself every morning at dawn and flies across the sky. She announces the morning's arrival. She has a brother and a sister. Her brother is the sun, and her sister is the moon. She also has many husbands and four sons, one for each cardinal direction: North, East, South, and West.
Aurora is comparable to Eos in Greek mythology and to Ushas in Hindu mythology.
One of her lovers was Tithonus. Aurora asked Zeus to grant immortality to Tithonus. However, she failed to ask him for eternal youth. As a result, Tithonus ended up aging eternally.
In Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet" (i.i) Montague says of his lovesick son Romeo
The asteroid 94 Aurora was named after her.
