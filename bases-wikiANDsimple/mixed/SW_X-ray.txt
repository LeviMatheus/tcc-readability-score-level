X-ray is part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with frequency higher than ultraviolet radiation. The frequency of X-ray covers a wide range. It can penetrate many solid materials. X-ray can be produced by hitting metal with fast-moving electrons.
X-ray photography is used in medicine to see bones and cancers, and other things inside bodies.
There are small amounts of X-rays around in the atmosphere. X-rays can change living cells. This means that exposing the human body to high doses of x-rays, for a long time should be avoided. Changing living cells can be dangerous. It can cause cancer, amongst other diseases. It can also be good, as cancer cells can be killed that way. Like with any treatment, there are side-effects.
X-rays cannot see soft tissue very well. To detect tumors, other imaging technologies are used, like Magnetic resonance imaging.
