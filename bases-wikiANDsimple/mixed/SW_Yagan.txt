Yagan (c. 1795â€“11 July 1833) was a Noongar warrior who played an important part in early indigenous Australian resistance to European settlement and rule in the area of Perth, Western Australia. He led a series of attacks in which white settlers were killed. A reward was offered if he was captured dead or alive, and he was shot dead by a young settler. Yagan's death has passed into Western Australian folklore as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers.
His head was sent to London as a curiosity, only to stay in storage until 1964, when it was buried in an unmarked grave. It was uncovered in 1993 and then sent back to Australia. It still remains a source of controversy and the head remains unburied.
