The Animals were an English music group, who were most popular in the 1960s. They were known for their bluesy sound, and their deep-voiced singer Eric Burdon.
One of their first hit songs, "The House Of The Rising Sun", was an old American folk song, which they performed with a rock and roll beat. Folk musician Bob Dylan was impressed by the Animals version of the song.
Other Animals hits included "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place", "Don't Bring Me Down", "It's My Life", "See See Rider", "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", and "Sky Pilot". The original Animals disbanded, and Burdon moved to the United States, where he formed a new version of the band. They made more records, like "San Franciscan Nights".
The original Animals reunited in later years, to perform concerts, and Burdon performed Animals songs with other bands. Bass guitarist Chas Chandler became a music producer, with artists like Jimi Hendrix.
