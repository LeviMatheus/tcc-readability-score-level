Krakatoa (Indonesian name: "Krakatau") is a volcano near the Indonesian island of Rakata in the Sunda Strait. It has erupted repeatedly in known history. The best known of these events occurred in late August 1883.
The 1883 eruption ejected more than six cubic miles (25 cubic kilometres) of rock, ash, and pumice, and made the loudest sound ever recorded by human beings â€” the sound was heard as far away as Perth in Australia (very far), and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius (Very far). Many thousands of people were killed and injured by the eruption, mostly in the tsunami (giant wave) which followed the explosion.
The eruption destroyed two-thirds of the what was then the island of Krakatoa. New eruptions at the volcano since 1927 have built a new island, called "Anak Krakatau" (child of Krakatoa).
