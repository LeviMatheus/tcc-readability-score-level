Early life.
John Hunter was born in Leith, Scotland. His parents were William Hunter and Helen Drummond. He lived for a while with his uncle at Lyn, Norfolk. He studied music with composer Dr. Charles Burney. He started studying at the University of Aberdeen so that he could become a minister in the Church of Scotland. In 1754 he decided to become a sailor and started as the captain's servant in "HMS Grampus". The "Grampus" was a 14 gun sloop.

By 1755 he was an able seaman in the "HMS Centaur", the next year a midshipman on the "HMS Union" and the "HMS Neptune". These were the flagships of Admiral Charles Knowles. In 1757 Hunter took part in an attack on Rochefort. In 1757 he was involved in the attack on Quebec. Hunter passed his exams in navigation and astronomy in 1760 and qualified to be a lieutenant. It took until 1780 to get a job as lieutenant.
Hunter was a midshipman with Admiral Durrell on his flagships, the "HMS Royal Ann", "HMS Princess Amelia" and the "HMS Royal George". Durell made Hunter the master's mate in his new ship, the "HMS Launceston". He served in North America and by 1768 was the ship's master. He served on the "HMS Carysfort" at Jamaica from 1769 to 1771. He went to the East Indies on the "Intrepid" from 1772 to 1774. He then served in the "Kent" and the "Foudroyant". He returned to North America and was on the "HMS Eagle" with Admiral Lord Howe. With Howe's help and support, Hunter was finally made a lieutenant, 20 years after he passed his exams. Officer jobs were hard to get; there were more officers on shore on half pay than there were serving on ships.
John Hunter became lieutenant on the "HMS Berwick" and then on the "HMS Victory". He was made captain of the fireship "HMS Spitfire", and in November 1782, the sloop "HMS Marquis de Seignelay".
