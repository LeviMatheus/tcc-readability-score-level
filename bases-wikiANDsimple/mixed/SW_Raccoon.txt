The Raccoon ("Procyon lotor"), also known as the Northern Raccoon, Common Raccoon, Washer Bear or Coon, is a widespread, medium-sized, omnivorous mammal native to North America.
Description.
Recognized by its striped face and ringed tail, the raccoon has invaded almost every habitat and is commonly found even in towns and cities. The raccoon is curious, clever, and solitary and deceptively cuddly-looking. It owes its success to its ability to live in a wide variety of habitats and survive on a flexible diet.
Habitat.
Although most raccoons live in the wild, close contact with humans does not bother them. They often nest in empty buildings, garages, sheds, and even the attics of houses. Since raccoons are nocturnal animals, they are most active at night. Raccoons do not hibernate in the winter, but those that live further north, where it is colder, grow thick coats to keep them warm and spend long periods sleeping.
