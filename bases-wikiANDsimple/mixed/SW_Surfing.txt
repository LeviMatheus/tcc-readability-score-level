Surfing is a water sport. It is done in the ocean or sea, where the surfer uses his surfboard to catch a wave, and ride in towards the shore.
Surfing was invented by the Polynesians, at least 4000 years ago. It has become a popular sport among both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers comprise a unique culture. Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its mecca remains Hawaii, where the international surfing championships are held annually.
