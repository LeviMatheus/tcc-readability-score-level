Whisky is an alcoholic drink distilled from grain and aged in wooden casks.
The name comes from a gaelic word. In Scotland it is known as Scotch whisky or just Scotch. In Ireland, which has a different gaelic language, it is called whiskey, with an added letter "e". Whiskey made in the United States uses the Irish spelling.
Most whiskies contain around 40% alcohol.
Scotch whisky.
Scotch whisky is legally defined by Scotch Whisky Order of 1990 (UK), and the Scotch Whisky Act of 1988.
Alcohol is a favourite way to collect tax (called excise duty) in the United Kingdom. When Gordon Brown, a Scot, became Chancellor of the Exchequer, he concentrated on taxing beers and wines, and did not increased the duty on whisky. This, he said, was to help the Scotch whisky industry to recover and make more money and increase exports.
