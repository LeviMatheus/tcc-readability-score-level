The Inns of Court are professional associations, in London, in which every English barrister must belong to. The associations have directing and disciplinary functions over their members. The Inns also provide libraries, dining facilities and professional accommodations to members. Each Inn also has a church or chapel.
Over the centuries the number of active Inns of Court was reduced to four, which are Lincoln's Inn, Gray's Inn, Inner Temple and Middle Temple.
