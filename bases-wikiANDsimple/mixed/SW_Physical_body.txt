In physics, a physical body (sometimes called simply a body or even an object) is a collection of masses, when you look at them as one object only.
For example, a cricket ball can be understood as an object but the ball also consists of many particles (pieces of matter).
A human's, animal's or vegetable's physical body is made up of organs and tissues and is a part of the total living being which in the human being may also include a psychological or spiritual component.
