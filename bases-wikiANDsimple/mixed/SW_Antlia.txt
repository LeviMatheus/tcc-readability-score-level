Antlia is a constellation, or group of stars in the sky that form a picture. It looks like an air or vacuum pump. Its stars are so faint that before astronomers had powerful electronic telescopes, nobody had given it a name. People who live in the northern parts of the world can see it in latitudes to 66 degrees north and people who live in the southern parts of the world can see it 50 degrees south from January through March.
