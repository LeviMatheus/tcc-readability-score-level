Anaphylaxis is a severe and fast multi-system allergic reaction. Anaphylaxis is triggered by a substance, called an allergen, that the body believes is bad. Very small amounts of allergens can still cause anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe medical emergency, as the airway quickly closes. The brain can not survive more than a few minutes without oxygen. Death within minutes is possible. The most severe type, called "anaphylactic shock", will cause death very quickly if not treated.
Emergency treatment.
Calling for help is very important when dealing with anaphylaxis because medical help is needed immediately. CPR or Rescue breathing may be necessary if the patient stops breathing on their own. Epinephrine should be given to the person right away, because the epinephrine prevents the airway from constricting more and keeps the heart beating. Most people who have been diagnosed with anaphylaxis carry an EpiPen (pictured) or something similar to use in the event of anaphylactic shock. EpiPens contain epinephrine.
