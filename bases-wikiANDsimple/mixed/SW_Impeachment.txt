Impeachment in many places is part a process to remove government officials without that official wanting to leave his job. It is like an indictment (something that the prosecutor needs to get before the trial). After somebody gets impeached, a legislature votes on whether or not to convict, or find him guilty. The second legislature is sometimes made up of the same people that impeached him, and sometimes it isn't.
