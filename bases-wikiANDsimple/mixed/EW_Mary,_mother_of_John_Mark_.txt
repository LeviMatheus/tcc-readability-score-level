Mary, mother of John Mark is mentioned in the , which says that, after his escape from prison, Peter went to her house: "When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying." This seems to be the only mention of her in the Bible. From this it would appear that Maryâ€™s house was a place of assembly for the Apostles and other Christians.
The question whether her son John Mark can be identified with others called Mark or John in the New Testament is discussed in the article about him. Greek scholars reject his identification with Mark the Evangelist and have a separate feast for John Mark in their synaxarion. Catholic scholars are divided on this issue.
Mary, mother of John Mark is included in the Old Roman Martyrology of the Catholic Church. But later on, a revision was made hence the removal of Mary, mother of John Mark in the roster of saints. Still considered as blessed but because of that many questions her sainthood hence considering her as not a saint.
