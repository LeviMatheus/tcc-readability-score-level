The Monty Hall problem is a puzzle. It has to do with chance. The puzzle is based on America's game show "Let's Make a Deal". The name comes from the show host, Monty Hall.
In the puzzle, there are 3 doors. Behind 2 doors there are goats. And behind the last door there is a car. The host asks a player to choose a door. After the player chooses a door, the host opens a door with a goat behind it. Then, the host asks the player if he would like to change his selection.
In the puzzle, it is proved that if the player changes his choice, the chance of him getting a car is 2/3. And if the player does not change his choice, then the chance of him getting a car is 1/3.
1. If the player picks a goat, then the host will show the other goat. Then if the player changes his choice, he will get a car.
2. If the player picks the other goat, then the host will show the first goat. Then if the player changes his choice, he will get a car.
3. If the player picks the car, then the host will show a goat. Then if the player changes his choice, he will get a goat, NOT a car.
