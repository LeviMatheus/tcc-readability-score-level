The Feathertail Glider ("Acrobates pygmaeus"), also known as the Pygmy Gliding Possum, Pygmy Glider, Pygmy Phalanger and Flying Mouse, is the world's smallest gliding mammal, and is named for its long feather-shaped tail. Although only the size of a very small mouse (65 to 80 mm and 10 to 14 g), it can leap and glide long distances from tree to tree, up to 25 metres. Like other gliding mammals, the Feathertail Glider has a skin membrane between the fore and hind legs; thicker than that of the other marsupials like the Sugar Glider, but smaller in proportion, extending only between the elbows and knees.
