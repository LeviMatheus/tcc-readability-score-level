Falling is movement that happens due to gravity, such as when something rolls off a table and falls down to the floor. Falling is a common cause of people's injuries, especially for elderly people and for people who do sports and other leisure activities.
Elderly people.
In some cases, elderly people become less steady on their feet. If elderly people fall to the ground, they are at a greater risk of having serious injuries, such as breaking their hip.
Sports.
During sports and other recreational activities such as bicycling or skateboarding, people are more likely to fall. Some bicyclists and skateboarders wear protective clothing to protect their body in the event of a fall, such as a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads.
Other meanings.
There is also an expression "falling in love," which means when two people begin to feel romantic love or emotional attachment to each other.
