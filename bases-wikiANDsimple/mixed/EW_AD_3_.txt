AD 3 (III) or 3 AD was a common year starting on Monday or Tuesday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar (the sources differ, see leap year error for further information) and a common year starting on Monday of the Proleptic Julian calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Lamia and Servilius (or, less frequently, year 756 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination "AD 3" for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
