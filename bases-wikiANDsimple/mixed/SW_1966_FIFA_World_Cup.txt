The 1966 FIFA World Cup was the eighth FIFA World Cup. It was held in England from July 11 to July 30. England was chosen as hosts by FIFA to celebrate 100 years of football in England. England won the final beating West Germany 4-2. This was England's first (and so far only) World Cup win. England also became the first host to win since Italy won it in 1934. Later Germany, Argentina and France won it at their homes.
