The anticipated 1944 Winter Olympics, which would have been officially known as the V Olympic Winter Games (because of the cancellation of 1940's V Olympic Winter Games), would have been celebrated in 1944 in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Cortina d'Ampezzo had won the right to host the event in June 1939, but because of World War II, the 1944 Winter Olympics were cancelled. As a result, the V Olympic Winter Games took place in Saint Moritz, Switzerland in 1948. Cortina d'Ampezzo later held the 1956 Winter Olympics.
