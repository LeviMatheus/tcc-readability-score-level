The Inquisition is the name for a number of judgments. The Catholic Church did most of them, for heresy. In the Middle Ages, heresy was common. There were also special people to judge these heresies. The usual punishment for those who were found guilty was death. There were several movements, and waves of inquisition.
The word Inquisition comes from Latin "quaerere". That means to "to turn", "to ask a question".
