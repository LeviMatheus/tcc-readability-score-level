A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, a normal calculator will add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere. Even our computer is a calculator.
Some calculators, like the abacus will work without batteries, others, like the electronic calculator won't. There are two types of electronic calculators, the simple one, with only the main functions of plus, minus, times and division, and sometimes a square root, and the scientific one, with many other functions too such as factorials, and permutations.
There are different ways to write mathematics on a calculator. For example, after pressing "3" and then "+" and then "2" and then "=" (or "ENTER") the number "5" will be displayed on the screen. This is called Infix notation. Many more advanced calculators use postfix notation, that is, "3 4 +" instead of "3 + 4 ="; The third way of noting things, "+ 3 4", called prefix notation, is rarely found on calculators.
