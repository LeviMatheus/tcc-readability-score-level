A joint (articulation) is the place at which two bones make contact (articulate). Joints allow movement and give mechanical support.
Joints have cartilage in between to make the movement flexible.Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.
