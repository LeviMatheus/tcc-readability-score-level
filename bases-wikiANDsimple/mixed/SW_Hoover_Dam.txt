The Hoover Dam is a large dam on the Colorado River. It is located on the border of the states of Arizona and Nevada. The dam is named after the former US President Herbert Hoover. At first it was called "Boulder Dam", but the name was changed to honour Hoover who was president when the idea of building the dam started.
