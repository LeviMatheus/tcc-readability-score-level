Ecstasy (also known as MDMA, E, X, or XTC), is an illegal drug. Ecstasy comes in tablet/pill form, and is most commonly swallowed.
History.
On December 24, 1912, a German medicine company called Merck patented Ecstasy. The patent was granted in 1914.
In the 1950s, the United States army conducted several experiments with ecstasy, such as using it on animals.
Supply.
Ecstasy, like most other illegal drugs in the United States, is widely available. Ecstasy is bought by the pill. Pills often cost from $1 to $10 each. In the United Kingdom, it is common to pay £2 or £3 per pill. In Australia, it is common for these pills to cost about $25, but they can range from $7 to over $40 each.
Legal Use.
Ecstasy is illegal in the United States and was called a "Schedule I" drug. Schedule I drugs have no medical value and are highly addictive. Today, some people consider Ecstasy a "Schedule III" drug, because of its use in therapy.
