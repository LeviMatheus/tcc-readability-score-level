In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem describes the behaviour of holomorphic functions near their essential singularities. It is named for Karl Theodor Wilhelm Weierstrass and Felice Casorati. In Russian literature it is called Sokhotski's theorem.
Formal statement of the theorem.
Start with some open subset formula_1 in the complex plane containing the number formula_2, and a function formula_3 that is holomorphic on formula_4, but has an essential singularity at formula_2 . The "Casorati–Weierstrass theorem" then states that 
This can also be stated as follows: 
Or in still more descriptive terms:
The theorem is considerably strengthened by Picard's great theorem, which states, in the notation above, that formula_3 assumes "every" complex value, with one possible exception, infinitely often on formula_6.
In the case that formula_3 is an entire function and formula_22, the theorem says that the values formula_23
approach every complex number and formula_24, as formula_13 tends to infinity.
It is remarkable that this does not hold for holomorphic maps in higher dimensions,
as the famous example of Pierre Fatou shows.
Examples.
The function "f"("z") = exp(1/"z") has an essential singularity at 0, but the function "g"("z") = 1/"z"3 does not (it has a pole at 0).
Consider the function
This function has the following Taylor series about the essential singular point at 0:
Because formula_28 exists for all points "z" ≠ 0 we know that "ƒ"("z") is analytic in a punctured neighborhood of "z" = 0. Hence it is an isolated singularity, as well as being an essential singularity. 
Using a change of variable to polar coordinates formula_29 our function, "ƒ"("z") = "e"1/"z" becomes:
Taking the absolute value of both sides:
Thus, for values of "θ" such that cos "θ" &gt; 0, we have formula_32 as formula_33, and for formula_34, formula_35 as formula_33.
Consider what happens, for example when "z" takes values on a circle of diameter 1/"R" tangent to the imaginary axis. This circle is given by "r" = (1/"R") cos "θ". Then,
and
Thus,formula_39 may take any positive value other than zero by the appropriate choice of "R". As formula_40 on the circle, formula_41 with "R" fixed. So this part of the equation:
takes on all values on the unit circle infinitely often. Hence "f"("z") takes on the value of every number in the complex plane except for zero infinitely often.
Proof of the theorem.
A short proof of the theorem is as follows:
Take as given that function "f" is meromorphic on some punctured neighborhood "V" \ {"z"0}, and that "z"0 is an essential singularity. Assume by way of contradiction that some value "b" exists that the function can never get close to; that is: assume that there is some complex value "b" and some ε &gt; 0 such that |"f"("z") − "b"| ≥ ε for all "z" in "V" at which "f" is defined.
Then the new function:
must be holomorphic on "V" \ {"z"0}, with zeroes at the poles of "f", and bounded by 1/ε. It can therefore be analytically continued (or continuously extended, or holomorphically extended) to "all" of "V" by Riemann's analytic continuation theorem. So the original function can be expressed in terms of "g":
for all arguments "z" in "V" \ {"z"0}. Consider the two possible cases for
If the limit is 0, then "f" has a pole at "z"0 . If the limit is not 0, then "z"0 is a removable singularity of "f" . Both possibilities contradict the assumption that the point "z"0 is an essential singularity of the function "f" . Hence the assumption is false and the theorem holds.
History.
The history of this important theorem is described by
Collingwood and Lohwater.
It was published by Weierstrass in 1876 (in German) and by Sokhotski in 1868 in his Master thesis (in Russian).
So it was called Sokhotski's theorem in the Russian literature and Weierstrass's theorem in
the Western literature. 
The same theorem was published by Casorati in 1868, and
by Briot and Bouquet in the "first edition" of their book (1859).
However, Briot and Bouquet "removed" this theorem from the second edition (1875).
