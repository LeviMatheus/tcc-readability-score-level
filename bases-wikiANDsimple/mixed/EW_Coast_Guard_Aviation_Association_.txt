The Coast Guard Aviation Association, formerly known as the Ancient Order of the Pterodactyl (AOP) is a fraternal association founded in 1977. The organization has the purpose of focusing on United States Coast Guard aviation history. On 5 May 2007, the organization was renamed the Coast Guard Aviation Association.
Membership is for former and present officers and enlisted personnel of the United States Coast Guard, and designated pilots of other military services and foreign governments who have piloted Coast Guard aircraft while involved in exchange programs between the Coast Guard and their respective service or government.
Its goals include furthering and preserving the history of Coast Guard aviation and maintaining camaraderie between past and present Coast Guardsmen. The Coast Guard Aviation Association is headquartered in Chantilly, Virginia.
