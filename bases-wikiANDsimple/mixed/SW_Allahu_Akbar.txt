Allahu Akbar is a Muslim saying. It is often used in situations ranging from a greeting to an expression of strong sentiments. It is most correctly translated as "God is greater", but in many instances "God is great" is an equally correct translation.
"Allahu Akbar" is the first part of the Adhan, which is heard 5 times daily in Muslim communities. The saying is a very strong expression that summarizes the entire core of Islam.
This Arabic phrase was added to the Iraqi flag, in Saddam Hussien's handwriting, in 2001. Muslims say it before changing positions during there prayers.
