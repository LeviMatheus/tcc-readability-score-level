Wookieepedia (the "Star Wars" Wiki) is an online encyclopedia for information on the Star Wars fictional universeâ€”including information of six films, as well as Expanded Universe. It is a more specialized and useful wiki for those who wish to go further than the basics in the Star Wars universe, and is almost entirely in-universe. The name Wookieepedia is a portmanteau of Wookiee and encyclopedia, being a pun on name of Wikipedia. Wookieepedia is hosted by Wikia.
