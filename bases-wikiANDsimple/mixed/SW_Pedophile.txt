A pedophile is an adult who is sexually attracted to children who have not reached puberty, or who are not yet fully sexually adult. A pedophile has a mental disorder called "pedophilia". Some people with pedophilia have sex with children or use children in a sexual way. This is called "child sexual abuse". Most, but not all, children who are sexually abused, are abused by people who have pedophilia. Some adults have pedophile feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children. The common definition also says that a pedophile is at least 5 years older than the victim, and at least 16 years of age.
Is it common?
Medical researchers do not know how many people in the population are pedophiles. This is because it is hard to study people's feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings. A second reason is that when an adult or teenager sexually abuses a child, people often call the abuser a "pedophile", but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason. A person is only a pedophile if they are sexually attracted to children. If a person sexually abuses a child to frighten or punish them, for example, then it may not be true pedophile behaviour. However, most child sexual abuse is committed by pedophiles.
Some studies have shown that those pedophiles who are attracted only to children, if they act on their feelings and abuse a child, often abuse many more victims than those pedophiles who also have sex with adults.
The people who abuse children or teenagers are often known to them, and are not strangers. Around half the adults who commit child sexual abuse against strangers also abuse their own children.
Treatment.
As of 2008, most doctors believe that pedophilia cannot be cured. The current approach to deal with pedophiles tries to change the behaviour of the pedophile. It does not change their sexual attraction. Using this treatment, some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again.
