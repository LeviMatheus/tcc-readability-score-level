Nature.
New Zealand was isolated from the rest of the world for a long time. Because of this there are many plants and animals that only live in New Zealand. Before humans came to New Zealand, there were no mammals except two bat species. Instead New Zealand has many different kinds of bird, for example the kiwi.
