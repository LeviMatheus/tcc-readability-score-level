In the fictional "Star Wars" universe, the Jedi or Jedi Knights are members of an old order, who use a power they call The Force.
The Jedi use The Force to have magic-like powers. Their typical weapon is the lightsaber, a sword-like weapon with an energy blade.
The Jedi try to lead a good and virtuous life, serving others. They keep and defend the peace of the galaxy.
The opposite of the Jedi are the Sith, who follow the Dark side of the Force.
