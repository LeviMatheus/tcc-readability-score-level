The Mongol Empire, an area ruled by the great Mongol khans in the 13th and 14th centuries, was one of the largest land empires in history.
The original homeland of the Mongols, was bounded by the Khingan Mountains on the east, the Altai and Tian mountains on the west, the Shilka River and the mountain ranges by Lake Baikal on the north, and the Great Wall of China on the south.
It was founded by Genghis Khan in 1209 AD when he brought together the Mongol tribes. He later died in 1227 AD. Later Kublai Khan would go on to expand the empire and found the Mongol-ruled Yuan Dynasty of China. It later broke into several empires, all of which were later destroyed.
