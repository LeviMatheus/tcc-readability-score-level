Dundee Football Club, founded in 1893, are a football team based in the city of Dundee, Scotland. They are nicknamed "The Dee" or "The Dark Blues" and play their home matches at Dens Park. Their home shirt colour is dark blue.
Dundee FC currently play in the Scottish First Division, having been relegated from the Scottish Premier League in 2005. The team is currently managed by Alex Rae, who played for the club but recently retired from professional football. Rae was appointed on 24 May 2006, following the sacking of Alan Kernaghan. For the past three seasons they have failed to gain promotion back to the top tier as they finished 7th in 2005-2006, 3rd in 2006-2007 and 2nd in 2007-2008. In the 2005-2006 Dundee managed to reach the Scottish Cup semi-final but were beaten 3-0 by Gretna, then a Scottish Second Division side.
Unusually for a city of its size, Dundee supports two senior professional football teams, Dundee FC and Dundee United. Their grounds are within a few hundred yards of each other and are the two closest professional football grounds in the United Kingdom.
