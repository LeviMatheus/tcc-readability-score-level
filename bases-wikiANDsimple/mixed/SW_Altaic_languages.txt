Altaic is suggested as a language family. It would include 66 languages that are spoken by about 348 million people, mostly in and around Central Asia and northeast Asia.
According to the best-known classification of Altaic, it consists of the Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic language families. It is probably fair to say that this is the meaning attributed to "Altaic" by most general linguists.
However, since the publication of Gustaf John Ramstedt's "Einführung" in 1952–1957, most Altaicists have included Korean in Altaic. Since the publication of Roy Andrew Miller's "Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages" in 1971, most have also included Japanese (Nicholas Poppe) or better Japonic, consisting of Japanese and Ryukyuan.
A few linguists even count Ainu with the Altaic languages, but as part of a node including Korean and Japanese, in contradistinction to a Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic node, with Korean-Japanese-Ainu and Turkic-Mongolic-Tungusic in turn forming a node at a higher level (e.g. Street 1962).
The core version of Altaic, consisting of Turkic, Mongolic, and Tungusic, is sometimes referred to as "Micro-Altaic" while the expanded version, including Korean or Korean and Japanese, is referred to as "Macro-Altaic".
