Activities in physics.
To get the data that physics relies on, experiments are made sometimes.
Sometimes experiments are not possible, but data is still found by observation.
Often special kinds of devices, machines and instruments have to been designed and built to make the measurements and observations in physics.
To explain the data, theories are produced.
Many people work in using the methods, data and theories of physics to make things or do tasks. This is called applied physics. Applied physics sometimes overlaps with engineering.
Fields of physics.
Physics is roughly broken into two parts; classical physics and modern physics. Classical physics is the physics that does not use quantum mechanics or relativity. Modern physics is the physics that uses quantum mechanics and relativity. There is some overlap between classical physics and modern physics. Modern physics was mainly created after the year 1900.
Fundamental forces.
In unified field theory, physicists attempt to understand how these four forces are all different aspects of a single force.
Theories of physics.
A theory is an explanation created to describe the measurements and observations. There are many theories in physics. Some theories belong mainly to classical physics and some belong mainly to modern physics.
