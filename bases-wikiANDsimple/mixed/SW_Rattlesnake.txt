The rattlesnake is a kind of snake, a reptile. About 50 kinds of rattlesnakes are known. They are a kind of pit viper. Men of science call the two big groups of rattlesnakes (each called a genus) either "Crotalus" or "Sistrurus". All of them have a poison bite, but some kinds are a much greater danger than others.
The name "rattlesnake" is used because they have a special tail with several parts on the end that can make a loud "bzzzz" sound, or rattle.
Rattlesnakes live in North and South America, especially, but not always, in dry areas.
