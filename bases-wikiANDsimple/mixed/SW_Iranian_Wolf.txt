The Iranian wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) is a subspecies of Grey Wolf which ranges from Lebanon, Northern Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. The Iranian wolf was thought to be the most likely direct ancestor of the Dingo, however recent evidence has shown the Dingo to be more closely related to domestic dogs.
