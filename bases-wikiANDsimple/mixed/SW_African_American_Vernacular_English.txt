African American Vernacular English (AAVE) is a name for the way some black persons talk. Linguists who study various spoken forms of language gave it its name. Some non-black persons use this dialect, too. Some of its pronunciations and grammar resemble the way people talk in West Africa.
It first came about in the 16th and 17th centuries.The African-slaves developed a way to communicate["citationÂ needed"] among all their various tribes.
African American Vernacular English became famous in 1996, when some educators in Oakland, California said they wanted to use AAVE to help teach black kids. They called it Ebonics. However, Ebonics often has a negative connotation.
There are many rules that govern how the sounds of AAVE are different from Standard English. Some have to do with pronunciation and vocabulary (or lexicon). Most have to do with grammar. This includes verb tenses, and sentence structure.
Hip hop music has made AAVE more famous since the 1980s. Some people think it is cool and they try to speak it or learn it even if they are not really familiar with it. Some non-black people can speak it well.
