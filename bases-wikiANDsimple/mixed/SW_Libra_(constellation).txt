Libra (, symbol, Unicode) is a constellation of the zodiac. It lies between Virgo to the west and Scorpius to the east. It once represented the claws of Scorpius.
Some features.
α and β Librae are the scales' balance beam, and γ and σ are the weighing pans.
σ Librae was formerly known as γ Scorpii even though it is well inside the boundaries of Libra. It was not renamed as σ Librae until 1851 (by Benjamin A. Gould).
