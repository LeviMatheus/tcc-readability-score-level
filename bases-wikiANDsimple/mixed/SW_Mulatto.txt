Mulatto (from Spanish "mulato", small mule) is a word referring to a person who is born to one Black parent (often an African-American) and one Caucasian parent. The term may be considered offensive or rude to some, because of its origin. The term is also used to refer to a light brown color, because of a mulatto's skin color. Many people prefer terms such as "biracial" and "of mixed race" over "mulatto".
