People with learning disabilities, also called learning difficulties, are people who find it hard to gain knowledge or understanding. Some people with learning difficulties also find it hard to fit in with other people because there are many things that people must know to live in society.
Learning difficulties can be things that people can learn to live with on their own, like dyslexia (a difficulty with reading and writing). They can also be very big things that mean a person needs a lot of help (like autism). Adults with learning difficulties are sometimes misunderstood by other people who think that they are stupid or have mental illnesses. However, they can often deal with their difficulties by doing things in different ways. Some people with learning difficulties can be very clever. Historians think that some important historical people had learning difficulties, for example, Sir Isaac Newton.
