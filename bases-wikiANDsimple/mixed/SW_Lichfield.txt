Lichfield is a small city in Staffordshire, England.
The first part of the name comes from a nearby Roman-British village called "Letocetum". It was captured by the Mercians some time before 669, when it was called "Licidfelth". Between 786 and 803, the Christian archbishop in England was here, instead of Canterbury.
