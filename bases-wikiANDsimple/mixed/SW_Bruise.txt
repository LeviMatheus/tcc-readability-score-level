A bruise, also called a contusion or ecchymosis, is a kind of injury to biological tissue in which the capillaries are damaged, allowing blood to seep into the surrounding tissue.
It is usually caused by blunt impact. Bruises often cause pain but are not normally dangerous. Sometimes bruises can be serious and lead to other more life threatening forms of hematoma, or can be associated with serious injuries as fractures and internal bleeding. Minor bruises may be easily recognized, in people with light skin color, by their characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as "black and blue") in the days following the injury.
In language.
More generally, "bruise" is used metaphorically to mean any minor injury in other fields than health. It means that the injury is painful and sensitive but minor and will recover on its own.
