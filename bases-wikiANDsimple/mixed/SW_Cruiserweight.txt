Cruiserweight is a division in boxing for fighters who weigh over 175 pounds and up to 200 pounds (91kg). The weight limit was once 190 pounds. The World Boxing Council created this weight division in the late 1970's because it felt that some fighters were too small to fight in the heavyweight division but too big to fight in the light heavyweight division. So they made a weight class in-between. Many cruiserweight champions and contenders may eventually fight in the heavyweight division.
Evander Holyfield was cruiserweight champion.
