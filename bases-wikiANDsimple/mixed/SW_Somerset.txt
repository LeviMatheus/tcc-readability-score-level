History.
The name "Somerset" comes from the Anglo-Saxon phrase "Sumorsaete". This means "the land of the summer people", because in the past people could only live on the land in the summer. In the winter, the land was flooded.
In the past, the northern border of Somerset was the River Avon. However, as the city of Bristol has grown, the border moved south.
In 1974 parts of north Somerset, the city of Bristol and parts of south Gloucestershire were joined into a new county. This county was named Avon. In 1996 Avon was split into 4 parts, which are now unitary authorities. People usually say that 2 of these parts (named North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset) are part of Somerset, even though they have their own councils.
The oldest prison in England which is still used is in a town named Shepton Mallet in Somerset. Somerset also has the world's oldest road which people built. It is called the Sweet Track; it was built in about 3800 BC.
Industry and tourism.
There is not much large industry in Somerset, but Bridgwater is a port, and Yeovil is important in building helicopters.
Farming is an important industry in Somerset, but not as many people work in this industry today. Somerset is famous for its cider (an alcoholic apple drink) and it has many apple orchards.
