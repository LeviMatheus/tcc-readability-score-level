DeMuDi ("Debian Multimedia Distribution") is a defunct Linux distribution based on Debian with improvements for music, sound and video production.
DeMuDi was developed by the AGNULA Project, a European Union funded project to improve access to multimedia software, and was also known as A/DeMuDi, with A standing for Agnula.
When funding stopped volunteers continued to work on the project for a short time, but it has now it has totally joined the Debian Multimedia Project.
