The F-105 Thunderchief was a bomber during the Vietnam War. It first flew in 1955, and was introduced in 1958. It was used as a bomber, but was later replaced by the F-4 Phantom II and the F-111 Raven. But it was still in service for a while as a Wild Weasel. It could carry an electronic counter-measures pod that could mess up the enemy radar.
