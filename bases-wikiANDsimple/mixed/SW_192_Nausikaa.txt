192 Nausikaa is a big main belt asteroid. It is an S-type asteroid.
It was found by Johann Palisa on February 17, 1879. The name comes from Nausica√§, a princess in Homer's Odyssey.
Based on the lightcurve data from Nausikaa, a possible moon was reported in 1985. However, it has not been confirmed.
A shape model of Nausikaa has been constructed, also based on the lightcurve data. It indicates a roughly-cut, but not very stretched body.
In 1998, an occultation of a star by the asteroid was seen from the United States.
