Prokaryote is a word that describes a type of cell. The name comes from Greek "pro-" (meaning "before") and "carion", meaning "nut" or "kernel". Prokaryotes are cells that do not have a cell nucleus. They also lack other things eukaryotes (cells with a true nucleus) have. Prokaryotes do not have membranes inside the cell. This means that there are no vacuoles, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticula or other organelles inside the cell.
Most prokaryotes are unicellular. Most are bacteria. Some prokaryotes are called Archaea. These include simple organisms, that were first discovered in extreme environments. Most of them can survive at very high or very low temperatures. Some of them can also survive in highly salty, acidic or alkaline water. Some have been found in geysers, black smokers or oil wells.
Cells with a nucleus are usually called Eukaryotes.
