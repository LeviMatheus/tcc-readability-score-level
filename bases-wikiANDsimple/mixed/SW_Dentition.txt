Dentition is the development of teeth and where the teeth are in the mouth. Almost all mammals have up to four different types of teeth: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars. Mammals that have different types of teeth are called "heterodont". If they do not, they are called "homodont".
In many mammals, the children have a set of baby teeth that fall out. When they fall out, adult teeth grow in. Animals that have baby teeth and adult teeth are called diphyodont.
Dentition in the study of history.
Dentition is important to people who study history. This is even more important if they are studying older things. Dentition is used to see where people moved, because people from different places have different teeth.
