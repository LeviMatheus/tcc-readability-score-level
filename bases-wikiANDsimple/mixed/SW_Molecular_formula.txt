A molecular formula (or chemical formula) shows how many different atoms in one molecule of a chemical compound and how they are connected together. An example of a molecular formula is H2O2 or hydrogen peroxide (can also be called dihydrogen dioxide). What makes this a molecular formula is that it is composed of mark two non-metals: hydrogen and oxygen. A mixture of individual hydrogen and oxygen molecules is highly combustable in fire, but when they are chemically combined together in a chemical reaction they form water.
