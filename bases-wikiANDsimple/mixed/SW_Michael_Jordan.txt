Michael Jordan (born February 17, 1963) is a retired American basketball player. Many people believe Jordan is one of the greatest basketball players to ever play in the NBA. He won six championships playing for the Chicago Bulls and head coach Phil Jackson. The Chicago Bulls team set a record by winning 72 games. Jordan was part of this team and played together with men like Dennis Rodman, Scottie Pippen, and Toni Kukoc. Jordan also won two Olympic gold medals for basketball. His first was in 1984 as a college player and his second was in 1992 as an NBA player.
In the middle of his career in basketball, Jordan switched to a career in minor league baseball. He played for the Chicago White Sox minor league team, but hit only one home run during his whole baseball career. He eventually bought part of the Washington Wizards basketball team and was a part time player. Jordan is now officially finished with his basketball career.
