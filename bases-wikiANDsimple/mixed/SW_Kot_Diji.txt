The ancient site at Kot Diji (Urdu: کوٹ ڈیجی) was the forerunner of the Indus Civilization. The people of this site lived about 3000 BC. The remains consist of two parts; the citadel area on high ground, and outer area.
Located about 22 kilometres south of Khairpur in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. The site is situated at the foot of the hills where a fort (Kot Diji Fort) was built around 1790 by Talpur ruler of Upper Sindh, Mir Suhrab who reigned from 1783 to 1830. This fort built on the ridge of a steep narrow hill is well preserved.
