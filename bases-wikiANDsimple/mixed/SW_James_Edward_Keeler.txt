James Edward Keeler (September 10 1857â€“August 12 1900) was an American astronomer.
He worked at Lick Observatory beginning in 1888 but was appointed director of the University of Pittsburgh's Allegheny Observatory in 1891. He returned to Lick Observatory as its director in 1898, but died not long after in 1900. He had married in 1891 and left a widow and two children.
He discovered two asteroids, although the second was lost and only recovered about 100 years later.
