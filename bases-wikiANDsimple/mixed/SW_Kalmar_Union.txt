The Kalmar Union was a historical union of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Western Finland, and various other provinces and areas. At that time, Norway included Iceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Orkney, and parts of Finland belonged to Sweden. The union was founded at a meeting in the town Kalmar in Sweden in 1397. The union broke up in 1523 because Sweden became independent.
