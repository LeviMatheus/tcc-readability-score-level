The electric eel, "Electrophorus electricus", is a species of fish. It is capable of generating powerful electric shocks. The animal uses these shocks both for hunting and to defend itself. It is an apex predator in its South American range. This means that usually, it has no enemies except other animals of its own species. Despite its name, it is not an eel at all but rather a knifefish.
