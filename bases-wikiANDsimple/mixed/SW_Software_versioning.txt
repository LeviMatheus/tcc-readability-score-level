Software Versioning is a way to tell the different states of Computer software apart. Computer software has different states in its development process. Each state in the process is given a unique Version. Versions are either names, dates, or they can be done as some other form of numbering. Sometimes these states are also called "revisions".
Many times, after a program has been made, things called "patches" can be downloaded from the program's website. The patches will make small changes or fixes to the main program. When a patch is used, the program is advanced to the next version. For example, a computer game is first at version 1.0 when it is released. Later, the player may download a patch, which changes the game to version 1.1, 1.01, or something similar to that.
