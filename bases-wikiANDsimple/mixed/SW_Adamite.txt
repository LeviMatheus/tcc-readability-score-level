Adamite is a mineral that can be either yellow, purple, green, pink, or yellowish-green in color and is made from crystals. It is very easy to break and it can be scratched by a copper penny. Adamite is not radioactive. It is named for the French mineralogist Gilbert Joseph Adam (1795-1881), who was the person who discovered it. It is found in Chile, in the Atacama Desert.
