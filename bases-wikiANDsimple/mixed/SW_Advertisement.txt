An advertisement (or ad for short) is anything that draws good attention towards a product, service or person. Ads appear on television, as well as radio, newspapers, and magazines.
Television advertisements.
Television advertisements (commercials, or "advert" in United Kingdom) are advertisements between television shows. They are usually for products, other television shows or movies and normally last around 30 seconds long.
Internet advertisements.
Internet advertisements (also known as a "banner ad" or "popup") are advertisements on a website. They are often still images or flash animations.
The owner of the website will get money when a user clicks on the advertisement. Sometimes they will get a percentage of the money if they buy a product.
Radio advertisements.
Radio advertisements are audio advertisements that play between music on a radio station. They normally last 15 seconds in length.
