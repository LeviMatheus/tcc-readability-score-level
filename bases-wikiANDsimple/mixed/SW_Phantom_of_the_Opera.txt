"The Phantom of the Opera" ("Le Fantôme de l’Opéra" in France) is a French novel by Gaston Leroux. It was published in 1910; an English edition came out a year later.
The book was turned into a famous stage play by Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1986.
Several movie versions have been made, most notably in 1925, 1943, 1974 (as Brian de Palma's "The Phantom of the Paradise") and 2004.
