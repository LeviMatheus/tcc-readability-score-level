Artibonite is one of the ten departments (French: "départments", singular "départment") of Haiti. It is named Artibonite because the Artibonite river flows across the department from east to west.
With an area of 4,984 km², it is largest department of Haiti. It has a population of 1,168,800 (2002). The main cities are Gonaïves (the capital) and Saint-Marc.
It is bordered to the northwest by the Nord-Ouest Department, to the north and northeast by the Nord Department, to the east by the Centre Department and to the south by the Ouest Department. The Gulf of Gonâve is to the west.
Most of the rice of Haiti is grown in the Artibonite department.
The independence of Haiti was proclaimed in the "Place d'Armes" of Gonaïves on 1 January 1804 by Jean Jacques Dessalines.
