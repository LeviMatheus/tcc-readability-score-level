A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor device. It is a type of diode that makes one color of light when electrically biased in the forward direction. This effect is a form of electroluminescence. The color of the light depends on the chemical composition of the semiconducting material used, and can be near-ultraviolet, visible or infrared.
