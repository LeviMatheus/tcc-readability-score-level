Year 107 (CVII) was a common year starting on Friday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Sura and Senico (or, less frequently, year 860 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 107 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
