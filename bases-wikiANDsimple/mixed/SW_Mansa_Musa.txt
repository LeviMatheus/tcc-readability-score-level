Mansa Musa was a 14th century Mansa (king). He ruled the Mali Empire. He is famous for his Hajj. On it, he is said to have given out millions of US dollars worth of gold. As a matter of fact, he gave out so much gold in Cairo that the value stayed relatively low for many years. It also helped to spread Islam.
