Pineapple is a plant and a fruit. It is from Brazil, Bolivia, and Paraguay, but is grown as a crop in other tropical areas, most famously in Hawaii.
The pineapple ("Ananas comosus") is a tropical plant and fruit (berry), probably native to Brazil or Paraguay. The plant is a short (1–1.5 m) herbaceous perennial with 30 or more trough-shaped and pointed leaves 30–100 cm long, surrounding a thick stem. The leaves of the Smooth Cayenne cultivar mostly lack spines except at the leaf tip, but the Spanish and Queen cultivars have large spines along the leaf margins. Pineapples are the only bromeliad fruit in widespread cultivation. It is slightly acidic, if you have a sensitive tongue, you may not want to eat it. The Pineapple fruit is very tasty, some people like in on pizza, and some people like it on icecream.
