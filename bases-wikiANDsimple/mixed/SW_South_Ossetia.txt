South Ossetia (Ossetian: Республикӕ Хуссар Ирыстон, "Respublikæ Xussar Iryston"; Russian: Республика Южная Осетия, "Respublika Yuzhnaya Osetiya"; Georgian: სამხრეთ ოსეთი, "Samkhret Oseti" (unofficial) is a place in Georgia.
South Ossetia was a Soviet oblast (region) with some self-rule. It declared its independence and controls big parts of the region, but its separation from Georgia has not been recognized by any other country and is de jure (officially) a part of the Georgian region (mkhare) of Shida Kartli.
The rebels were supported by Russian and Cossack forces but, Georgia itself refuses to recognise rebel South Ossetia as an independent state; the government calls it by the medieval name of Samachablo or, more recently, Tskhinvali region (after the republic's capital).
