History.
The town was founded by people that came to look for gold in the Mao river and other rivers of the region. Later, some families came to live here to cut the many trees, mainly pines, that there were around the town.
On 9 April 1884, it was created the "Puesto Cantonal de Guaraguanó" in the Monte Cristi province. "Puesto Cantonal" was similar to a municipality; in English, "County (Military) Post". On 23 March 1898, the name of "Guaraguanó" was changed to the present name, "Monción", in honor of "Benito Monción", one of the heroes of the Restoration War against Spain.
When the Santiago Rodríguez province was created in 1948, Monción was one of the municipalities of that new province.
