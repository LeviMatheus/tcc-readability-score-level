His Majesty King Muhammad VI is the King of Morocco and is the head of state (Person in charge of the country). Even though he is the head of state, he does not choose what Morocco should do about things like education (teaching people), healthcare (making sick people better) or other choices. The person who chooses for the people in Morocco is the Prime Minister, who is in charge of the government. Today, the Prime Minister is Abbas AlFassi.
Geography.
Morocco is next to the countries of Algeria to its east and Western Sahara to its south. The Mediterranean Sea lies to the north of Morocco, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
Much of Morocco is in the Sahara Desert and so most people live in areas close to the coast. Morocco has an area of 446,550 kmÂ².
The capital of Morocco is Rabat. About 1.2 million people live in Rabat. The biggest city in Morocco is however Casablanca, with nearly 4 million people living there. Both Rabat and Casablanca are ports.
People and culture.
The population of Morocco is 34,343,219. People from Morocco are called Moroccans. Most Moroccans are either Arabs or Berbers.
The official language of Morocco is Arabic, but many people also speak Berber. French is also spoken, because Morocco used to be a "protectorate" (a type of colony) of France. Since Morocco is not far from Spain, some people speak Spanish as well.
Most Moroccans follow Islam as their religion.
Economy.
Mining is the largest part of Morocco's economy. The next largest part comes from Moroccans working abroad and sending money home to family and friends. Tourism is also important and many people come to see the historical places of Morocco.
The currency of Morocco is called the "dirham (MAD)".
