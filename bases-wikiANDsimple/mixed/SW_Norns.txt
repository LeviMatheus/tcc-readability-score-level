The Norns are deities in Norse mythology that governed fate. They are named Urd (the past), Verdandi (the being) and Skuld (what is to come). Skuld is also the name of a Valkyrie.
They are at the base of the tree Yggdrasil (or above the Bifröst bridge alternatively). They weave the tapestry of fates. Each person's life is a string in their loom. The length of the string is the length of the person's life. Even the gods have their strings, though the Norns hide the strings from the gods. So everything is set out beforehand. There is no luck, there is no randomness.
The Greeks called the Norns Moirae and the Romans called them Parcae.
The three norns feature in the opening of Richard Wagner's opera Götterdämmerung.
