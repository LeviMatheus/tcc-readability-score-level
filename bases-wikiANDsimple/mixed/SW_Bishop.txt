Bishop is a title for a rank in the clergy of a Christian Church. Usually, there are first priests, then there are bishops. In the Catholic church, the pope is chosen amongst all the bishops. According to Roman Catholic church law, this does not have to be the case; any male, unmarried, baptized Christian who is judged fit for the office can become pope. However, the last pope who was not a bishop was Urban VI (elected in 1378).
The pope is also the bishop of the city of Rome. All bishops answer to the pope (or to patriarchs in the orthodox churches).
Usually a bishop can be identified by a special hat, called a mitre.
