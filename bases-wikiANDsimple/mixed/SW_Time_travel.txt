Time travel is a fictional (made up) activity of going back in time to the past of the future. Scientists such as physicists say that time travel is not possible with our current technologies.
Movies and television shows.
Science fiction and fantasy movies and TV shows have been based on stories of people who travel through time. For example the US movie "Back to the Future" tells a made-up story about a professor who builds a machine that can take people into the future or back in the past.
Another example of a made-up story about time travel is in "Charmed", but instead of using machines and science, they use magic to go to specific times and places.
