The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXII Olympic Winter Games, is an international winter sports event that will be celebrated from February 7 to February 23, 2014. The host city, Sochi, Russia, was chosen on July 4, 2007, during the 119th International Olympic Committee (IOC) meeting in Guatemala City, Guatemala. This will be Russia's first time hosting the Winter Olympics (the Soviet Union hosted the 1980 Summer Games in Moscow though).
