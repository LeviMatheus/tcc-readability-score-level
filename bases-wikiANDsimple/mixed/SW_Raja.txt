A Raja (Sanskrit "राजा" (rājā), also spelled Rajah) is a monarch, or princely ruler of the Kshatriya varna.
The title has a long history in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, as it is found in the Rigveda. It can also be used as a name for non-royal Indians.
In Pakistan, Raja is still used by many Muslim Rajput clans as hereditary titles. "Raja" is also used as a name by Hindus and Sikhs.
