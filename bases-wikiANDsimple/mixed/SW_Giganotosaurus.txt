Giganotosaurus is one of the biggest carnivorous dinosaurs yet discovered. It had a length of 40-43 ft (12.2-12.5 m). The Giganotosaurus weighed about 7.2 tons and stood 12 ft tall at the hips. It walked on two legs and had a brain the shape and size of a banana. It had enormous jaws with 8-inch long teeth in a 6-foot (1.8 m) long skull. Giganotosaurus was a theropod from the mid-Cretaceous, living about 100-95 million years ago.
It is a dinosaur that means "giant southern lizard". Its fossil was found in Argentina in 1994. 70 percent of the skeleton has been found. Near the Giganotosaurus, fossils were found of 100-foot-long plant eaters. It is thought that these were victims of the Giganotosaurus.
Giganotosaurus was probably supported as the largest carnivorous dinosaur of all time it weighed nearly 8.2 tons and was nearly 17 feet [5.5m] feet high. Recent discoveries of giganotosaurus show lengths of 48-50 ft [1.6-14 m]. But through the years it has met some challenges such as spinosaurus a 33-52 foot [10-16m] carnivore with crocodile like jaws and conical teeth. So we do not have clear evedince wether spinosaurus was bigger than giganotosarus.But we do know that giganotosaurus was larger than tyrannosaurus in height and length. It may have preyed on the largest sauropods such as argentinosaurus as it did in packs in the walking with dinosaurs special chased by dinosaurs land of giants and dinosaurs giants of patagonia scientists are looking for more giganotosaurus fossils and maybe they will.
