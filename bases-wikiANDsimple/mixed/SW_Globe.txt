A globe is a picture of a planet drawn on a sphere. It is like a scale model of the planet.
Most globes are maps of the Earth. The most common types are political and physical. Political globes show countries, and physical globes show landscape like mountains and rivers.
Global as an adjective is used to mean the entire world rather than any special place. It is also used in fields like computers to mean across an entire hard drive, network, or any other operation.
