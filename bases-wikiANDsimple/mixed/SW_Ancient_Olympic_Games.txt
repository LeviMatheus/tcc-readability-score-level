The Ancient Olympic Games were a series of athletic competitions held between the city-states of Ancient Greece. They used to be called the Olympic Games (; "Olympiakoi Agones") until the modern day Olympic Games started. The Ancient Olympic Games began in 776 BC in Olympia, Greece. They ran until 393 AD.
Prizes at the games were olive wreaths, palm branches and woollen ribbons.
