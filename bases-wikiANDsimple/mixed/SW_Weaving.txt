Weaving is the interlacing of two sets of threads at right angles to each other to form cloth. Weaving is usually done on a loom.
One set of threads is called the "warp". These threads are held taut and in parallel order on the loom by "harnesses" creating a space called the "shed". The "weft" thread is wound onto "bobbins". The bobbins are held in a "shuttle", which carries the weft thread through the shed. The warp threads are moved over and under the weft threads
