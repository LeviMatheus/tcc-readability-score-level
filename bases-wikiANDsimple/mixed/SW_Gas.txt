A gas is one of the states of matter. Gases are "fluid". This means that they can freely move and expand to fill a container. They can be pushed into a smaller volume, or expanded into a greater volume. A gas has a very low density, because the molecules or atoms in the gas are far apart. The volume of a gas mainly depends on two things: temperature and pressure. If the temperature increases and the pressure is constant, the gas's volume will increase. If the pressure increases and the temperature is constant, the gas's volume will decrease.
The word "gas" can also refer to specific gases, such as natural gas, laughing gas (which is nitrous oxide), or acetylene. It can also be referred to the gas that comes out of the body by the digestive system. This happens when there is an air in the last 7 to 8 inches of the colon.
Sometimes people use "gas" as a shorter name for gasoline (which is called petrol in some counties), or for the gases used in chemical warfare, like mustard gas.
