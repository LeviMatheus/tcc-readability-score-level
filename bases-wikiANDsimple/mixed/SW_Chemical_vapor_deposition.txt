Chemical vapor deposition is a method of putting a thin layer of metal on to a surface using very low heat. It is specially useful for coating thin glass with metal without damaging the glass, using such a thin layer of metal that the glass can be seen through. This technology was invented by the Head of the Chemistry Department of Harvard University, Professor Roy Gordon, in the 1970s and perfected by his team during the 1980s. Chemical vapor deposition has a vast range of uses. Hip replacement joints are coated using chemical vapor deposition to make them lighter, stronger, and longer lasting. TFT displays (flat screen televisions and computer monitors) are made using chemical vapor deposition. This technology is also used to prevent double glazing windows and supermarket freezers from steaming up.
