Kanata was orinally part of the Township of March. It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th Century. It was mainly agricultural(Farms) until the 1960s when it became the site of alot of construction.

It was planned to have a mix of offices, residential(Housing) area, and green area. Kanata was divided into a number of communities. Each was Intented to have it's own Business Center and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan's Grant, and Kanata Lakes.
