Emmanuelle is the lead character in a series of French softcore based on a character created by Emmanuelle Arsan in the novel "Emmanuelle" (1959). Starting in the 1970s, many very successful movies were made from the book (and its sequels).
At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Alain Siritzky said that a worldwide search was to begin for a new Emmanuelle to star in a new series of films.
