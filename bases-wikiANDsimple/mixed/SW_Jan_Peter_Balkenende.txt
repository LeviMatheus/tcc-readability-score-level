Jan Peter Balkenende (born 7 May 1956 in Kapelle) is a Dutch politician. He has been the Prime Minister of the Netherlands since 2002. He is a member of the Christian CDA party.
In other countries, he is perhaps most famous because he looks like Harry Potter. This makes him popular with young children, but many Dutch make jokes about it and call him "Jan Potter Balkenende" and other names like that.
Balkenende lives in Capelle aan den IJssel.
