Mercury is a dense, opaque, metallic gray liquid. Mercury was often used in thermometers as it expands uniformly with any rise in the temperature. However, mercury is expensive, toxic, and cannot be used to measure temperatures lower than -39ËšC (as mercury freezes at that point). Mercury has been replaced largely by alcohol for use in thermometers, as alcohol is cheaper and safer than mercury.
