Sulfur mustard is a chemical compound. It can be used for chemical warfare. Most sulfur mustards are odorless, colorless viscious liquids at room temperature. When used in warfare, they have a color yellowish to brown. Some of them smell like culinary mustard, horseradish or garlic. They got their name from the smell, but are completely unrelated to culinary mustard.
Sulfur mustard (in its form mustard gas) was synthesized by Frederick Guthrie in 1860. It may have been discovered as early as the 1820s, by M.Depretz.
Its use during warfare was prohibited by the Geneva Protocol of 1925. This protocol outlawed the use of poison gas (which was widely used in the First World War). In 1993 an additional agreement the Chemical Weapons Convention was ratified. It also outlaws the production and stockpiling of such agents.
