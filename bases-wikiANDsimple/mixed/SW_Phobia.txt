Those who suffer, usually very strongly want to avoid (keep away from) what they fear. People with arachnophobia, for example, do not like spiders, and want to keep away from the places where they might find spiders.
It is hard to tell how many people suffer from phobias; numbers indicate though that between 5 and 13 percent seem to have a phobia. Women suffer from phobias about twice as often.
There are different ways to help people with phobias. There is treatment available; it focuses on making the patient less sensitive to the fear they suffer from, or showing him or her how the cycle of fear works. There is also medication available (mostly sedatives) that help people cope. Finally there are self-help groups.
It is said to originate from agreek god FOBO.
