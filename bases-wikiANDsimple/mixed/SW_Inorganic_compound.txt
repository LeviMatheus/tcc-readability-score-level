An inorganic compound is a chemical compound that is "not" an organic compound. Traditionally, inorganic compounds came principally from mineral sources of non-biological origin. Most known inorganic compounds are however synthetic and are not obtained directly from nature.
According to contemporary definitions, inorganic compounds include all compounds containing metals and metalloids. Although most carbon compounds are considered organic, cyanide salts, carbon oxides and carbonates are usually considered to be inorganic.
