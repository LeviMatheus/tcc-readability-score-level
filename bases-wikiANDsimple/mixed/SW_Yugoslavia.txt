Yugoslavia was a country in Europe. It existed from 1918 to 1992. From 1918 until 1928 it was called the "Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes". From 1928 until World War II it was the "Kingdom of Yugoslavia". In the war Croatia was a Nazi puppet state. After the war was born the "Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" with six republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Slovenia, and two autonomous provinces in Serbia: Vojvodina in the north, and Kosovo, next to Albania. In 1991 came the independence of Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and in 1992 of Bosnia-Herzegovina, causing the end of the country. Serbia and Montenegro, were the last two republics in the Socialist Yugoslavia. In 1992, they formed a new "Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" (FRY). In 2003, the FRY became the "State Union of Serbia and Montenegro". In 2006, the state union ended when Montenegro decided to be their country.
