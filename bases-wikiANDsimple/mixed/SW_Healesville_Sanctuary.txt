Healesville Sanctuary, or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park, is a zoo at Healesville in Victoria. It only keeps animals that come from Australia. It has a history of breeding Australian animals. It was the first zoo to breed a platypus. The only other zoo is Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also helps by breeding the endangered Helmeted Honeyeater.
The zoo is in a natural bush setting. Paths wind through different habitat areas with wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 Australian birds.
There are tours, bird shows and information areas for visitors.
Dr Colin MacKenzie (knighted in 1929) set up the "Institute of Anatomical Research" in 1920. It was on of land which had been part of the Coranderrk Aboriginal Reserve. The Reserve was given to the Healesville Council in 1927. It became the "Sir Colin MacKenzie Sanctuary" in 1934.
The first platypus bred in captivity was born at the Sanctuary in 1943 when it was managed by David Fleay.
