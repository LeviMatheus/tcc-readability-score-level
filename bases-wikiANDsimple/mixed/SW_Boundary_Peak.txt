Boundary Peak is a mountain, (or "peak"), in the southwestern U.S. State of Nevada. The county is Esmeralda. It is the highest point in Nevada. It is less than two miles from the Cal/Nev state line, which is why it is called "Boundary Peak". Boundary Peak is 13,141 feet tall, and the closest town is Dyer, a famous ghost town.
