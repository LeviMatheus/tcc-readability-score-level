The Victoria Cross for Australia (VC) is the highest military decoration given for bravery "in the face of the enemy" to members of the Australia Armed Forces. The medal was called the "Victoria Cross", but the name was changed in 1991. The "Victoria Cross" was started in 1856 for bravery in the Crimean War. The first medals were made from captured Russian cannons.
The first winner of the "Victoria Cross for Australia" is SAS Trooper Mark Donaldson. Donaldson won the medal for bravery in Afghanistan in September 2008. The medal was given to him in a ceremony on January 16, 2009. He was the first winner of a VC for 40 years.
