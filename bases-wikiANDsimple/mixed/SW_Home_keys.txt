On a QWERTY keyboard, the letters "ASDFGHJKL" and the semicolon (;) are called the home keys, or sometimes the home row.
Structure.
The home keys A, S, D, F, H, J, K, and L are where the fingers are placed, with both thumbs resting on the space bar. The pinkies (plural of pinky) go on the A and; keys, the ring fingers (fingers closest to the pinkies) on S and L, middle fingers on D and K, and the index fingers (those closest to the thumb) on F and J. Some computers have little bumps on the F and J letters to help the user tell where the home keys are. When the fingers are placed on the home keys, almost every key should be reachable from that position.
