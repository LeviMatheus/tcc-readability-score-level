Simultaneous multithreading, acronym SMT, is a technique for improving the overall efficiency of superscalar CPUs with Hardware multithreading. SMT permits multiple independent threads of execution to better utilize the resources provided by modern computer architectures.
Multithreading is similar in concept to multitasking but is implemented at the thread level of execution in modern superscalar processors.
The key factor to distinguish them is to look at how many instructions the processor can issue in one cycle and how many threads from which the instructions come.
