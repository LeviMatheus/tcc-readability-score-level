Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn (15 July 1606 â€“ 4 October 1669) was a famous Dutch painter and artist.
He was born in Leiden. In 1631 he went to live in Amsterdam, because many people there had heard of him and wanted him to paint their portraits. He married a woman called Saskia van Uylenberg. They had four children, but three of them died very young. After Saskia died, Rembrandt lived with a woman called Hendrickje Stoffels who had been his servant, and they had a daughter called Cornelia. Rembrandt died in Amsterdam on October 4, 1669.
Rembrandt painted many very famous pictures. Some of them are very large, and some of them are dark and sad. He was such a good painter, that many of his pictures make people feel as if they are taking part in what is happening. Paintings by Rembrandt can be seen in famous art galleries all over the world.
