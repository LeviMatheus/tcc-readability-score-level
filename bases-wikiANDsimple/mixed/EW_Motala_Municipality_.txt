Motala Municipality ("Motala kommun") is a municipality in Östergötland County in southeast Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Motala.
In 1971 Motala Municipality was formed by the amalgamation of the "City of Motala" with some of the adjacent rural municipalities. Three years later more entities were added, among them the former "City of Vadstena". In 1980 a new Vadstena Municipality was split off.
Geographically, Motala is situated where Lake Vättern drains into the river system of Motala ström, which was of central importance to the massive industrialization of Sweden in the 19th century.
