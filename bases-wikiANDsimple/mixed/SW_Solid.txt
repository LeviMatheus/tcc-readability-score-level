Solid is one of the four most common states of matter. Many natural solids are crystals. The molecules in a solid thing its atoms vibrate with little movement, so the entire thing cannot change shape or volume very easily.
When a solid becomes a liquid, this is called melting.
When a solid becomes a gas, this is called sublimation.
