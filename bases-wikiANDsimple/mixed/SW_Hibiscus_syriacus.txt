Hibiscus syriacus is one of the common flower trees found in gardens. This tree is sometimes called Rose of Sharon in English. It grows as a small tree (or shrub). A name in China is 木槿, and ムクゲ in Japan.
The part of the name "syriacus" seems to say that the origin of this plant is Syria, but the exact origin is so far unknown. Historically it was grown in ancient China and then it became a popular plant in Korea. Today the flowers are national symbols of Korea. And in Japan, the flowers are often shown at tea ceremonies for decoration.
There are many variations of flowers in Europe and in Asia; especially in Japan, because gardeners of the past were willing to produce different colors and shapes of flowers.
