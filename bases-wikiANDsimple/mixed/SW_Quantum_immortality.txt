Quantum Immortality is a theory in which it is proposed that the consciousness stays alive even though the conscious being dies. For example, someone detonates an bomb beside the victim, that victim survives in an alternate universe by being injured but living, or by the bomb not detonating. However, in the original universe, the victim "dies" in the blast. The consciousness is sent to that alternate universe where it will keep living.
