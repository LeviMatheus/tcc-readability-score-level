Human rights is the idea that people should have rights "just because" they are human beings. These rights are seen as "universal," which means they are meant for everyone, no matter what their race, religion, ethnicity, nationality, age, sex, political beliefs (or any other kind of beliefs), intelligence, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
Human rights history.
The idea of human rights comes from ideas found in religion and philosophy.
The modern Western idea of human rights started in the European Enlightenment.
In the 16th century, some people started suggesting that everyone had the right to choose their religion and their leaders. This sort of thinking was important in the English Civil War. After the war, the philosopher John Locke argued that people should have these rights; he was one of the first people to call them "human rights." These ideas were also important in the American revolution and the French revolution in the 18th century
Human rights laws.
Because people believe that human rights are important, countries make laws to protect them. These laws say that governments cannot take away people's basic rights. They make sure people who take away other people's rights are punished.
Some major political organizations have made statements that promote human rights. These are not laws, but they affect us anyway. If groups or countries do not follow these statements, others will condemn them (say that they are "very" bad); and then people may not talk with them, do business with them, or help them.
Some of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions. The United States' and France's constitutions are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights.
These are United Nations human rights "Covenants": agreements between people or countries. The countries who sign these two covenants agree to follow them.
Human rights abuses.
Abuse means to hurt someone very badly. Human rights abuse happen when a person is hurt in a way that violates (goes against) his human rights. Human rights abuses are also often called "human rights violations".
Many people, groups, and countries think protecting human rights is very important. But not everyone in the world believes in human rights. If people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people. Even if these people have no political power, they can be violent to other people. There are many people who work to protect everyone's human rights; some of these are government groups, and some are not with any government. They are sometimes called "Human Rights Organizations".
