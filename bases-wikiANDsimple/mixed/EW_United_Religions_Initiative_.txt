The United Religions Initiative (URI) is a global grassroots interfaith network.
It has local and global initiatives through more than 800 member groups and organizations, called Cooperation Circles, to engage in community action such as conflict resolution and reconciliation, environmental sustainability, education, women's and youth programs, and advocacy for human rights.
The organization was founded by William E. Swing, along with David Cooperrider and Diana Whitney. The URI Charter was signed by more than two-hundred people present, and hundreds more joining over the Internet, at a ceremony in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA on June 26, 2000.
URI also holds consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
