About the books.
Sometimes, the main character from one book is the mother of the main character from another book. For example, Tilly Middleton from "Bloody Tower" is the mother of Kitty Lumsden from "The Queen's Spies".
At the end of each book, there is some information about the time in history the book was about. Sometimes there is a timeline, or a fictional biography of the main character.
