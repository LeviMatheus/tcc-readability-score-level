"Lark Rise to Candleford" is a 2008 British television costume drama series, adapted by the BBC from Flora Thompson's trilogy of semi-autobiographical novels about the English countryside. The first episode aired on 13 January 2008 on BBC One and BBC HD. Its cast includes actors from other late 2007 and early 2008 BBC costume dramas such as "Sense and Sensibility" and "Cranford".
The filming of a second series is expected to begin in May 2008.
Changes from source material.
The Debtors Act of 1869 abolished imprisonment for debt and the series makes much of Mrs Arless's, played by Dawn French, imprisonment for debt. In the novels the events are played out in the 1880s and later, imprisonment for debt would therefore be anachronistic.
