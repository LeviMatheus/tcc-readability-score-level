Varg Vikernes(born Kristian Vikernes on February 11, 1973 near Bergen, Norway) is a black metal musician, convicted murderer, arsonist and political activist. In 1991 Vikernes created the one-man music project Burzum. Burzum quickly became important within the early Norwegian black metal scene. Later he became a part of the Heathen Front and wrote several writings on Germanic neopaganism. In a documentary on heavy metal, he was described as "the most notorious metal musician of all time."
In the early 1990's, there were black metal bands that believed in burning churches to prove their hatred for Christianity. Vikernes was found guilty of arson and the murder of another black metal singer. He was sent to prison for 21 years. Vikernes was up for parole in 2008 but it was denied.
