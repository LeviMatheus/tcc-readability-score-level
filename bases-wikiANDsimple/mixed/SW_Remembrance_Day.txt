Remembrance Day (in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom) is a day to remember people who fought and died in wars. It is on November 11th to remember the end of World War I on that day in 1918. Remembrance Day was started in 1919 by King George V from the United Kingdom. On the same day, other countries also have days to remember war and soldiers. There is Veteran's Day in the United States, and Armistice Day in France, Belgium, New Zealand and other countries.
Traditions.
There are some things that people do on Remembrance Day. One is having two minutes of silence at 11:00 AM. It is at 11:00 AM because that is when World War I ended. At a ceremony for Remembrance Day, before the two minutes of silence, a song called "The Last Post" is played on a bugle (or sometimes a trumpet). At the end of the silence, the bugle plays a song called "Reveille."
People often bring wreaths made of poppies to Remembrance Day ceremonies. The wreaths honor people who have died in wars.
In many countries, many people wear a fake poppy on Remembrance Day, and for a few days before. The poppy is a symbol to show that they remember the wars, and the soldiers who fought in them. Poppies were chosen to be a symbol because they often grew in battlefields, after the soldiers stopped fighting there.
