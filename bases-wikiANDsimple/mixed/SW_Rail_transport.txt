Rail transport is the movement of passengers and goods using wheeled vehicles designed to run on railway tracks. In most countries, this transportation method helps international trade and economic growth. Railways provide an energy-efficient way to transport material over land. The railway tracks are a large part of the system and provide smooth and hard surfaces on which the wheels of the train roll with a little friction. Also, the track spreads the weight of the train which means larger amounts can be carried than with trucks and roads.
