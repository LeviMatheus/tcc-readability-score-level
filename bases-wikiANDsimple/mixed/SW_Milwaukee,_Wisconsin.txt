Milwaukee is the largest city in the state of Wisconsin and 22nd-largest in the UnitedÂ States. The city is the county seat of Milwaukee County. It is on the southwestern shore of Lake Michigan, and is about 90 miles (145 kilometers) north of Chicago. As of the 2004 U.S. Census, Milwaukee had 583,624 people living in it.
The strange Indian name (Algonquin) has been subject to confusion. Latest and most authentic is based on (anasazipublishing.com pg. 79) the etymology shown on 1673 map by French. The town was shown as MESQUAKI-NINS. This means the people of the Mesquakie lived there. They now have a Casino in Iowa by same name, Mesquakie. The etymology is ME SEKI WA KI or "bodies of red and yellow" based on the yellow/orange clay that protected them from insects. Evidentally their language lacked a word for "orange". Actually, later the city was nick-named Cream City becasue of the famous color bricks manufactured there from that yellow clay.
