The Kingdom of Armenia was an independent kingdom from (approximately 355 years) 190 BC to AD 165, and a client state of the Roman Empire from 165 to 428.
After the destruction of the Seleucid Empire, a Hellenistic Greek successor state of Alexander the Great's short-lived empire, a Hellenistic Armenian state was founded in 190 BC by Artaxias I. At its height, from 95 to 66 BC, Armenia extended its rule over parts of the Caucasus and the area that is now eastern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Armenia was one of the most powerful states in the Roman East. It came under the Roman sphere of influence in 66 BC.
By the second century BC, the population of Greater Armenia (including today’s Karabakh) spoke Armenian, implying that today’s Armenians are the direct descendants of those speakers.
