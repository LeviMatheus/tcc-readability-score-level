In Buddhism, the word "Dharma" also means the very old teachings of the Buddha. So, when a person "studies Dharma," they are studying what the Buddha taught people.

In Hinduism.
In Hinduism, dharma is the spiritual law for human beings. It is the way of goodness, truth and duty. For example, for a youth, a big part of dharma is to be a good student. Parents’ dharma is to raise and support their family. Teacher’s dharma is to teach and the dharma of the police to protect others. Each age brings new responsibilities, so dharma will change. It is everyone’s dharma to be honest, kind and religious, and to be a good citizen. Hindus believe that following dharma fulfills the highest purpose on earth. When people follow dharma, they feel good about themselves, and life is most rewarding.
