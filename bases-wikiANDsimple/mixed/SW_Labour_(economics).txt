In classical economics and all microeconomics labour (or labor) is a measure of the work done by human beings and is one of three factors of production, the others being land and capital. There are macroeconomic system theories which have created a concept called human capital (referring to the skills that workers possess, not necessarily their actual work), although there are also theories that think human capital is a contradiction in terms.
Compensation and measurement.
