The Tungusic languages (also known as Manchu-Tungus, Tungus) are spoken in Eastern Siberia and Manchuria. Many linguists consider them to be part of the Altaic languages but many others do not think that is correct. Many Tungusic languages are in danger, and the long-term future of the family is uncertain.
