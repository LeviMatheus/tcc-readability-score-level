A Geiger counter (sometimes called Geiger-Müller counter) is a dosimeter that can measure ionizing radiation. The tool was developed by Hans Geiger and Ernest Rutherford in 1908. It was improved by Walther Müller in 1928.
Geiger counters can detect the presence of radiation. Some can also detect the intensity of it, and the angle from which it comes.
