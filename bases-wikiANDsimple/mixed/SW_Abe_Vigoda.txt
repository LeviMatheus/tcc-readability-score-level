Abe Vigoda (born February 24, 1921) is an actor in both television and movie. His most well known roles are playing mobster Sal Tessio in the movies "The Godfather" and ', and playing Detective Phil Fish on television shows "Barney Miller" and "Fish", "Fish" having been a spinoff of "Barney Miller".
In 1982, "People" magazine said that Vigoda had died, even though he did not. Vigoda took the error with a sense of humor, even appearing in a picture where he was in a coffin, holding said magazine. Since then, the false death information, as well as the question to whether Vigoda is dead or alive, has been used as a joke sometimes on various television shows and internet websites, including, a website that says if Vigoda is alive or dead.
