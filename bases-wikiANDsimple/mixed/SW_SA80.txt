SA80 or "Small Arms of the 80's" is the name of a weapons family used by the British Army and Royal Marines, all are of bullpup design; meaning the magazine is placed behind the trigger allowing the weapon to be shorter yet still have a long barrel.
The series includes an assault rifle know as the L85 and a Light Support Weapon (LSW) designated the L86 as well as a Carbine variant for helicopter crews and a bolt action army cadet variant. although amazingly accurate for their size the SA80 family has been plagued by poor reliability problems that have been addressed with an upgrade by the German arms company H&K when it was British owned; resulting in the A2 series, however not all models have been upgraded and A1 generations can be recognized by their simple circular cocking handle. A new upgrade program is under way for a very small number of SA80s since late 2007.
