Anorexia nervosa is a mental health condition and an eating disorder. The short name for this condition is anorexia. People with anorexia think that they are fat, or desperately fear becoming overweight or fat. They try to lose weight by eating too little and doing too much exercise. They do not eat the amount of food their body needs, in an effort to avoid gaining weight. This causes them to stay at a weight that is not normal for their age and height.
Diagnosis.
Doctors use the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to make a diagnosis and decide if a person has anorexia or not. Four signs of anorexia are listed in the manual. People do not have to show all four signs for the doctor to decide that they have anorexia.
