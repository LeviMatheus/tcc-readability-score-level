An avalanche is a phenomenon of nature. It is linked to snow. When there is a lot of snow on a mountain, some of the snow may come down the mountain, for some reason. This is then called an avalanche. People talk about avalanches because they may be dangerous to skiers, and other people doing winter sports.
Big avalanches may carry stones, boulders and trees with them. They may bury people under them. If the people are not found rapidly enough by rescue teams they will die of suffocation (not getting enough air) or of hypothermia (freezing cold).
European avalanche risk table.
In Europe, the avalanche risk is widely rated on the following scale, which was adopted in April 1993 to replace the earlier non-standard national schemes. Descriptions were last updated in May 2003 to enhance uniformity.
