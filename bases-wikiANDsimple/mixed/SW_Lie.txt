A lie is something that someone says that is not true. People that are lying often want others to believe that the lie is truth. People can have many reasons for lying, such as if they are hiding something, if they want something from you, or white lies. Some people are pathological liars.
Sometimes a person will say something that is not true, but they do not know it is not true. This person either learned the wrong information somewhere, or is delusional.
