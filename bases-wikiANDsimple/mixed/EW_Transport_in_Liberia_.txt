Transport in Liberia consist of railways, highways, seaports and airports.
Railways.
Historically, three railways were built in Liberia to export ore from mines; they were damaged during civil war. In 2010, only the Bong mine railway was operational but the Lamco Railway was at least partially rebuilt by Arcelor Mittal and put back into service in 2011. There are no rail connections with other countries, although there has been a proposal to extend the Bong mine railway to serve a mine across the border in Guinea.
