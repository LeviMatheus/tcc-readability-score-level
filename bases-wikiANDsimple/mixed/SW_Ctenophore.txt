The phylum Ctenophora (), commonly known as comb jellies'", is a phylum that includes the sea gooseberry ("Pleurobrachia pileus") and Venus' girdle ("Cestum veneris"). They are classically grouped with Cnidaria (jellyfish) in the Coelenterata infrakingdom. Ctenophores have recently been identified as the most basal known lineage of animals.
Even though they look like jellyfish, they are zoologically not related to them: They lack the characteristic cnidocytes (stinging cells) but have connective tissues and a nervous
system. There are close to 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea. Although there are a few benthic species, most are members of the gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire plankton biomass worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult; for this reason data on their lifespan are not available, but it is known that ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age and so can be assumed to have a short generation cycle.
The word "ctenophore" (or, without the "c") comes from Greek, "kteno"-, "kteis", "comb" and -"phore", meaning "bearer". It comes via the New Latin "ctenophorus" in the 19th century.
