A chemical property is a property, quality or way that an object is. A chemical property cannot usually be measured without changing or making the object chemically different or different in a way that would affect its chemical or atomic structure. This is different than the physical property of the substance because this property is only shown when the substance is reacting or changing its chemistry; because of this it is difficult to see a chemical property. Chemical properties are determined with an experiment or a highly developed model.
