The pelagic zone is the part of the open sea or ocean that is not near the coast or sea floor. The name comes from the Greek πέλαγος ("pélagos"), which might be roughly translated as "sea" but is more accurately translated as "open sea."
Sub-sections of the pelagic zone.
The bathypelagic, abyssopelagic, and hadopelagic zones are very similar in character, and some marine biologists count them as a single zone or consider the latter two to be the one zone. Some define the hadopelagic as waters below 6000 meters, whether in a trench or not.
