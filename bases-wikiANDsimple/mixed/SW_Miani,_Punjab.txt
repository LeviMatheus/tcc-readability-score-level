Sargodha itself was the homeland of Khatris and had a large concentration of the ancient Khatri clans. Khatris are found among both Hindu as well as Muslim Punjabis. Some Khatris were converted to Islam after he introduction of Islam into the Punjab. Miani continues to have a population of Muslim Khatris or Punjabi Shaikhs.
Miani was nicknamed Namak-Miani (salt Miani) because it was the main marketplace for salt that was mined from the mountains around Khewra.
