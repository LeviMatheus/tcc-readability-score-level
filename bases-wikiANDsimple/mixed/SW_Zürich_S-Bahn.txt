Zürich S-Bahn (German "S-Bahn Zürich" is a suburban rail system that links the City of Zürich to its agglomeration. The system has existed since 1990, when it was the first suburban rail system to begin operating in Switzerland.
Mid 2008, there were 380 kilometres of railway track, 171 stations and 28 lines. In 2007, about 355’653 passengers used the system every day.
Each line generally has two trains an hour.
Since 2002, there are also 7 lines that run during the night (usually one train per hour) druring week-ends, in the nights Friday-Saturday, and Saturday- Sunday. These are complemented by a number of bus lines. Usually, travelling with these night lines is subject to an extra fare, which has to be bought in addition to the normal ticket.
At the moment, between 75 and 80 mililon people use the system every year. About 70% of the people living in the agglomeration use the system. Plans include gradually introducing 4 trains per hour on most lines, and to extend the offer to 4 trains per hour between Zürich and Winthertur during the whole day, and not just during rush hour. A new tunnel is currently being built. This will allow trains from Wintherthur, Oerlikon to run through zurich main station without changing direction.
