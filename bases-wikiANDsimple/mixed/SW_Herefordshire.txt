Herefordshire (known as County of Herefordshire) is a county in the West Midlands region of England. It borders the English counties of Shropshire to the north, Worcestershire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south east and the Welsh counties of Gwent to the south west and Powys to the west. It is not to be confused with Hertfordshire, a county north of London.
It is pronounced (i.e. first syllable as in "herring", and -e- a separate syllable).
The county town of Herefordshire is the cathedral city of Hereford.
Waterways.
Historically, the Rivers Wye and Lugg were navigable but the wide seasonal variations in water levels mean that few craft larger than canoes and coracles are now used. There are canoe centres at, Glasbury-on-Wye, and Ross-on-Wye, as well as a rowing club in Hereford.
The early nineteenth century saw the construction of two canals, The and The but these were never successful and there are now few remains to be seen.
