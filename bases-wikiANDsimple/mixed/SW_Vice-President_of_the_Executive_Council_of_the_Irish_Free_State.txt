The Executive Council was the cabinet of the Irish Free State, it was headed by the "President of the Executive Council".
Constitution of The Irish Free State said that the Vice President would act for the President of the Executive Council while he was absent, or until a new President was elected
Because the Executive Council only had five, six or seven members, the Vice President was also a minister in charge of a department.
Neither the ministry of the Irish Republic nor the Provisional Government had a deputy head of government, so the office of Vice-President of the Executive Council was a new idea of the Free State. In 1937 when the Constitution of the Irish Free State was replaced by Bunreacht na hÉireann the Vice President was replaced by the Tánaiste.
