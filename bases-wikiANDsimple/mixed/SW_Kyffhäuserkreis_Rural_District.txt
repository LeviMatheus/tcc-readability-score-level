Kyffhäuserkreis is a rural district in the northern part of Thuringia, Germany.
History.
In the 12th century there was a castle on the Kyffhäuser mountains, which was built during the reign of emperor Frederick I. According to the local legend, the emperor did not die, but instead went to sleep in this castle.
From 1579 on the region belonged to Saxony, but after 1815 it was divided between the Prussian Province of Saxony and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen.
In 1952 the two districts of Artern and Sondershausen were set up by the East German government. These districts were merged in 1994, with only a few municipalities joining other districts.
Partnerships.
The district has a partnership with the district Ahrweiler in Rhineland-Palatinate, which was actually established with the district Artern in 1990.
Geography.
The district is named after the "Kyffhäuser" mountains. The main river is the Unstrut, which flows through the east of the district.
