A eunuch is a castrated man. His genitals are removed. This can be cutting off the testicles or removing the penis and the testicles.
Over the millennia since, eunuchs had a lot of different functions in different cultures such as domestics, treble singers, religious specialists, government officials, military commanders, and guardians of women or harem servants.
