A Carabiner is a metal loop, which can be opened on one side. The other side is often called "spine". Carabiners are often used for rock climbing, sailing and canoeing. They also are often used for construction of high buildings or window cleaning. The word comes from the German word "Karabinerhaken", which means "hook for a carbine".
