Chlorine (chemical symbol Cl) is a chemical element. Its atomic number (which is the number of protons in it) is 17, and its atomic mass is 35.45. It is part of the Group 7 (halogens) on the periodic table of elements. A highly irritating, greenish-yellow gaseous halogen, capable of combining with nearly all other elements, produced principally by electrolysis of sodium chloride and used widely to purify water(usually in a swimming pool), as a disinfectant and bleaching agent, and in the manufacture of many important compounds including chloroform and carbon tetrachloride. Atomic number 17; atomic weight 35.453; freezing point -100.98°C; boiling point -34.6°C; specific gravity 1.56 (-33.6°C); valence 1, 3, 5, 7. it was discovered in 1774 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele who thought it contained oxygen. Chlorine was named in 1810 by Humphry Davy who insisted it was an element.
