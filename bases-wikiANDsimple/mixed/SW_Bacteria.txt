Bacteria (one of them is a bacterium) are very small organisms (living things). They are so tiny they can be seen only through a microscope. Bacteria are made up of just one cell, so they are a kind of "unicellular organism". They are among the simplest single-cell organisms on earth, where they have been living for many billions of years.
There are more individual bacteria than any other sort of organism on the planet. Most bacteria live in the ground or in water, but many live inside or on the skin of other organisms, including humans. There are about ten times as many bacterial cells as human cells in each of our bodies. Some bacteria can cause diseases, but others help us in everyday activities like eating, digesting food and absorbing oxygen. Some even work for us in factories, producing cheese and yoghurt.
A bacterium reproduces (creates more bacteria) by dividing in half and creating two "child" cells. Each child is identical in shape to the parent, but smaller.
They vary widely in size and shape, but in general are at least ten times larger than viruses. A typical bacterium is about 1 Âµm (one micrometer) in diameter, so a thousand bacteria lined up would be one millimeter long.
Bacteria are identified and grouped by their shapes. The bacilli are rod-shaped, the cocci are ball-shaped and the spirilla are spiral-shaped.
Pathogenic bacteria, the harmful kind, enter the human body from the air, water or food. Once inside, these bacteria attach themselves to or invade specific cells in our respiratory system, digestive tract or any open wound. There they begin to reproduce and spread while using the human body as a source of their own nutrients and energy.
