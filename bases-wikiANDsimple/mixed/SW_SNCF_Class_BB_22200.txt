The BB 22200 is a class of electric locomotives in service with the French railways SNCF, built by Alsthom between 1976-1986. They are a polycurrent version (1500 CV direct current and 25 kV 50 Hz AC) of the BB 7200 and BB 15000 classes, with which it shares the exterior appearance. Thanks to this characteristic they can run in all French electrified lines.
