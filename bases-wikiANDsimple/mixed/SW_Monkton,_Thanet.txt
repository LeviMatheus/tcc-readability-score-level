"Monkton is an English village located on the Canterbury-Ramsgate road, at the south-western edge of the Isle of Thanet, Kent near St Nicholas at Wade and Minster-in-Thanet. The church is dedicated to Mary Madgalene. Inside the Church is a plaque, comemorating a Local Soldier, Euncie Rochelle who died in the Iraq war. Monkton is no longer believed to be a village in its own right and is usually assumed to be part of neighbouring village Minster-in-Thanet.
In the November of 2007, the hamlet exploded, with the remains afterwards being burnt down, with firefighters atempting to put out the blaze, but having such a small population and being so far away from any other main towns, the thirty firefighters were unaible to reach it in time. However, fortunately, all of Monkton's population of twenty people was evacuated into safety to nearby Minster. However, Minster was reported to have complained about the overcrowding caused by this and threw out the newcomers, expecting them to go back to the destroyed settlement. Unfortunately for the hamlet, Monkton's largest building, a single story house, was also lost, and therefore it is thought to take a long time before the people of Monkton are able to resettle in a new hamlet, or whether they will be able to reconstruct some of their old habitat.
