Field Hockey is a well-liked sport for both men and women. It is played in many countries all around the world.
The game is played between two teams and each team is made up of eleven players.
Field hockey is played with a ball on natural grass, or on sand-based or water based artificial turfs with a small hard ball.
The field played on is rectangular and has a goal at each end. A semi-circle about 15 meters from the goal is known as the shooting circle. Goals can only be scored when the ball is in the shooting circle.
The hockey stick that is used is a J shape and made out of wood, glass and fibre. The stick has a curve hook at the end.
The positions are similar to the game soccer; in which they have fullbacks, halfbacks and forwards.
Each team has a selected person who plays the goalkeeper. The goalkeepers try and stop the opposition team from scoring goals.
Each player has to wear shin guards and a mouth guard, to protect their shins and protect their teeth.
