Reconnaissance, sometimes referred to as scouting, is the act of exploring (especially military or medical) to gain information. Often referred to as "recce" (UK, Canada and Australia,) or "recon" (U.S.,), the associated formal verb is "reconnoitre" (British spelling) or "reconnoiter" (American spelling). In informal English, both "recce" and "recon" are often also used as a verb.
