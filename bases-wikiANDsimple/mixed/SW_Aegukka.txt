Aegukka (Aeguk-kka; 애국가; 愛國歌), meaning The Patriotic Song is the national anthem of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). It should not be confused with South Korea's anthem, which has the same name. It is sometimes also known by the first bit of the song, "Achhimŭn pinnara" (아침은 빛나라), meaning "Let Morning Shine".
