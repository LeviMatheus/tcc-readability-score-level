Tin is a slightly soft, silvery metal. It is chemical element 50 on the periodic table (the number tells us where the element is found on the table). The chemical symbol for tin is Sn. Its melting point is 231.93°C and its boiling point is 2602°C.
People discovered tin long ago and used it with other metals. When copper and tin are mixed together, bronze is made, and bronze was useful and looked like gold. Tin can be mixed with other metals so that they do not rust too much. Tin foil and tin pans are also useful. Tin foil is not used anymore, as aluminum foil is cheaper.
Boxes for food are often made of tin. We call such boxes "tins". Biscuits (cookies) can be kept in a tin. Sardines can be bought in small tins.
