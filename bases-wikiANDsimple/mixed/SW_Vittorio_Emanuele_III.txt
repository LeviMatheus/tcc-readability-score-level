Vittorio Emanuele III (11 November, 1869 â€“ 28 December, 1947) was king of Italy from 1900 to 1946.
Vittorio Emanuele III was the son of Umberto I. He became king, at age 31, after his father was killed in 1900. Because people said Vittorio Emanuele had worked together with Benito Mussolini too much, Italy became a republic in 1946.
