Dilong (which means 'emperor dragon') is a genus of small carnivorous dinosaur. This only species is "Dilong paradoxus". It is from Lower Cretaceous near Lujiatun, Beipiao, in the western Liaoning province of China, Around 130 million of years.
The name is derived from the Chinese 帝 dì meaning 'emperor' and 龙 lóng meaning 'dragon'. "Di", "emperor", refers to the relationship of this animal to T.Rex, the "king" tyrannosaurid. "Long" is used to name Chinese dinosaurs in much the same way that the latin "-saur(us)" is in the West. The specific name, "paradoxus", is a Latinisation of the Ancient Greek παράδοξον meaning 'against received wisdom'.
Adult tyrannosaurs are found in Alberta (Canada) and Mongolia.
