The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is a trade agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada. The agreement became effective on January 1, 1994. It removed taxes on products traded between the United States, Canada, and Mexico. It also protects copyright, patents, and trademarks between those three countries. It was updated with the North American Agreement for Economic Cooperation, which helped set more environment regulations and helped reduce pollution. It was also updated with the North American Agreement for Labor Cooperation, which helped people fight for better labor conditions.
Effects.
Since it took away taxes between products traded between the US, Canada, and Mexico, Mexico has been buying more stuff from the US. It saved U.S. companies on the cost of selling stuff to Mexico, and it saved Mexican companies on the cost of buying things from U.S. companies.
Another one of its benefits is that labels on stuff exchanged between the three countries come in French, English, and Spanish. That way, Mexicans can read the Spanish label, Americans can read the English label, and Canadians who speak French can read the French label.
NAFTA also encouraged more immigration between the U.S. and Mexico. However, it did not increase immigration between Mexico and Canada, or the U.S. with Canada.
