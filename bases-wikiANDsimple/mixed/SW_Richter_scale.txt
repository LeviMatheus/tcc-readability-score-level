The Richter magnitude scale is a scale of numbers used to tell the size of Californian earthquakes. Charles Richter developed the Richter Scale in 1935.
Earthquakes that are 4.5 or higher on the Richter scale can be measured by tools all over the world.
The scale is logarithmic, with a base of 10. This means that an earthquake which scores 3.0 on the scale is ten times as powerful that one that scores 2.0.
