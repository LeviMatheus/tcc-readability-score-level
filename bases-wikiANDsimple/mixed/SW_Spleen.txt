The spleen is a gland that works closely with the circulatory system. The spleen produces, monitors, destroys and stores red blood cells. The spleen also has two other functions, the red and white pulp. The white pulp helps fight infections and the red pulp removes unwanted materials. Until recently, the purpose of the spleen was not known.
The spleen is above the stomach to the left, underneath the rib cage. Spleens in healthy adults are 9 to 13 centimetres (3.5 to 5.1 in) in length.
