Java man is the name given to fossils discovered in 1891 at Trinil on the baks of the Bengawan Solo River in Eats Java, Indonesia, one of the first known specimens of Homo erectus. Its discoverer, Eug√®ne Dubois, gave it the scientific name "Pithecanthropus erectus", a name derived from Greek and Latin roots meaning "upright ape-man".
