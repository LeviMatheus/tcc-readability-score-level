Diego Rivera (December 8, 1886 â€“ November 24, 1957) was a famous Mexican painter and muralist. He was born in Guanajuato City, Guanajuato.
Rivera is most famous for his 1933 mural, "Man at the Crossroads," for the lobby of the RCA Building at Rockefeller Center. Before he finished the mural, people saw that there was an image of Vladimir Lenin and other communist images in it. Rivera was fired because of this and the mural was destroyed.
Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, was also a famous Mexican painter.
