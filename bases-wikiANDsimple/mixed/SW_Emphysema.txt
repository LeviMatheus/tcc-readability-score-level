Emphysema is a disease of the lungs. It happens when the little air sacs at the ends of your airways in your lungs start to break down. People with emphysema may find it hard to breathe because they trap air in their lungs and have a hard time getting air out of their lungs.
Emphysema is one of the diseases referred to as a Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). The other disease is chronic bronchitis.
Most people get emphysema through smoking. As emphysema progresses over the years, patients with emphysema may find it increasingly difficult to climb inclines and stairs, exercise vigorously, and do physical activities at the pace of those with healthy lungs. Emphysema patients may also need extra oxygen if their lungs are not able to get enough oxygen from their lungs to the rest of the body.
People who suffer from emphysema may have swollen legs. This is due to a build up of fluid in the legs (which also may happen in the lungs). Severe cases of emphysema require hospital treatment but there is little they can do to help. The damage cannot be reversed.
