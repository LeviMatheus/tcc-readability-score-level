Coin collecting is when people buy or keep coins which are old, rare, beautiful or just interesting for the pleasure of owning them. Coin collecting is a very old hobby, Julius Caesar was a coin collector. Coin collecting can be very cheap, because many coins from the last century and from very late Roman times were made in large amounts, so there are lots of them to go around. Some coins, however are very expensive, because lots of collectors want them, and only a few examples exist. Some coin collectors like to collect one coin of each date for a type of coin, and this makes some coins rare dates, because there are lots of the type but only a few of the date. Other colletors like to collect one coin of each King or Queen of a country.
