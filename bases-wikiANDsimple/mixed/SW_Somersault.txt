A somersault is an acrobatic move where a person tucks in mid-air and moves the feet over the head. The somersault can be done forwards, backwards, or sideways and is similar to a "flip" (or, if performed backwards, a "backflip").
The word comes from the old French word "sombresault", which is no longer used.
