762 Pulcova is a main belt asteroid. It was found by Grigoriy N. Neujmin in 1913, and its provisional name was 1913 SQ. It is named after Pulkovo Observatory, near Saint Petersburg. Pulcova is 137 km in diameter, and is a C-type asteroid, which means that it is dark in colouring and is made of carbonates. Its density appears to be unusually low, which means that it may be a loosely-packed rubble pile, not a solid object.
In 2000, astronomers at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, found a small, 15 km moon orbiting Pulcova at a distance of 800 km. It was one of the first asteroid moons to be seen.
