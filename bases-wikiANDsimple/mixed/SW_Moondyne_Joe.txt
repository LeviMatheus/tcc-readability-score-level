Moondyne Joe was a bushranger from Western Australia who was born in 1826 and died in 1900. His real name was Joseph Bolitho Johns.
Moondyne Joe was a thief who was sent to Australia from England to serve a sentence for stealing three loaves of bread, one piece of bacon, several cheeses, and other goods. After he arrived in Australia, he was released and went to live in the bush in the hills around Perth. While he was there he stole a horse and was sent to prison at Fremantle.
He escaped from prison and was later recaptured. This happened several more times until he was finally released for good in 1871.
