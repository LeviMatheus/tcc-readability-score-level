A character is a person in a work of art such as a novel, play, opera or movie. If it is a made-up person (not someone who really lived) it is a "fictional character". Some examples are Kermit the Frog, Yoda, and Bart Simpson of "The Simpsons.
The word character can also mean "personality". We can say that someone has a "strong character" meaning a strong, confident personality. It is sometimes used as a noun in this sense: "He is a real character" (meaning someone you cannot easily forget).
A character role in a play means one of the people in the play who have a particular character (personality). They contrast with the main characters of the play. For example, there may be two lovers who are the main characters of the story. The character roles might be: a wicked step-mother, a kind nurse, an old wise man, a stupid fool, a servant who is very old etc.
