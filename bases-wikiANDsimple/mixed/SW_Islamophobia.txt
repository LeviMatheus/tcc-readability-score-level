Islamophobia is a political term meant as an insult that literally means the fear of Muslims. It is sometimes used to describe a hatred of the religion and its followers and often actions taken in order to voice this fear and hatred. "Islamophobia" can supposedly take the form of criticisms against certain ideological positions taken by believers but almost always state the religion itself as the actual problem.
Many muslims are put through many hardships and and unfair treatments because of this.
