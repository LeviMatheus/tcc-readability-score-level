Censorship is when someone, often a government, does not allow certain things to be published. A censor is a person whose job is to look at all types of media and remove material. There are many reasons to censor something, like protecting military secrets, stopping immoral or anti-religious works, or keeping political power. Censorship is almost always used as an insult, and there is much debate over what censorship is and when it is okay.
When there is freedom of speech and freedom of the press, most information can published. However, even in developed countries with much freedom of the press, there are some things that cannot be published. For example, journalists are usually not allowed to publish many secrets about the military, like where troops will be sent on a mission. Pornography, especially child pornography, is censored in many countries because it is seen as not moral. For these reasons, the government might arrest anyone who publishes them.
Debate.
There is much debate about when censorship should be allowed. For example, U.S. President Richard Nixon censored The New York Times when they tried to publish articles about the Pentagon Papers, a group of classified military documents that showed Nixon and the military lied Vietnam War. The Supreme Court in New York Times Co v. United States overturned the censorship, saying that Nixon had not shown it would be dangerous to the military, just embarrassing. In other countries, journalists and bloggers (who are usually not seen as journalists) are sometimes arrested for saying bad things about the government. In Egypt, Kareem Amer was famously arrested for insulting Islam and calling the president of Egypt, Hosni Mubarak, a dictator.
Non-Governmental Censorship.
Governments are not the only ones who censor information. For example, when the history department at Middlebury College did not allow professors to accept Wikipedia as a source in papers, some said it was censorship.This was because the department was telling professors (who usually have academic freedom) what works they should and should not accept. Sometimes a group or a website - even the Simple English Wikipedia - will not allow some facts, articles, and pictures that they do not think should be seen. There is much debate over the difference between censorship and editing, that is, deciding what should or should not be published.
