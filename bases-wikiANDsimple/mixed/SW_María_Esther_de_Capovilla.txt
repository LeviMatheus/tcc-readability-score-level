María Esther de Capovilla (September 14, 1889 – August 27, 2006) was a Ecuadorian supercentenarian and the world's oldest living between May 29, 2004, aged 114 years 258 days, and her death from pneumonia on August 27, 2006, aged 116 years 347 days. At the time of her death she was and still is, as of October 2008, the sixth oldest person on record (fifth oldest if the questionable case of Shigechiyo Izumi is discounted). Following Capovilla's death, Elizabeth Bolden became the world's oldest person.
