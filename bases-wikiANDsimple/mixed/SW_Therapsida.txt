Therapsids ("Therapsida"), previosly known as the "mammal-like reptiles", are an order of synapsids. Traditionally, synapsids were referred to as reptiles. However, when the term is used cladistically, the taxon also includes the mammals, which are descended from the cynodont therapsids.
Characteristics.
Therapsids' temporal fenestrae were larger than those of the pelycosaurs. The jaws of therapsids were differentiated into frontal incisors for nipping, large lateral canines for puncturing and tearing, and molars for shearing and tearing, and molars for shearing and chopping food. Therapsids legs were positioned more vertically beneath their bodies than were the sprawling legs of reptiles and pelycosaurs.
