History.
Flash was created by FutureSplash (a multimedia company) in 1995. Then it was called "FutureSplash Animator" (this was in fact Flash 1.0). FutureSplash along with Flash were soon bought by Macromedia around 1997, who in December 2005 was again bought by Adobe Systems. From Flash version 2 to 8 it was called "Macromedia Flash", now it is called "Adobe Flash". The current version is Adobe Flash CS4, made in October 2008.
