Freiberg (i.e. "free mountain") is a city in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, capital of the Freiberg Rural District.
The city was founded in 1186, and has been a centre of the mining industry in the Erzgebirke Mountains for centuries.
In 1944 the Flossenburg concentration camp built a subcamp built outside the city of Freiberg. It housed over 500 female survivors of other camps, including Auschwitz Birkenau. Altogether 50 or so SS women worked in this camp until its evacuation in April 1945. The female survivors later reached the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.
