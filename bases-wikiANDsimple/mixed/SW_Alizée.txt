Alizée Jacotey (born August 21, 1984) is a French singer. Born in Ajaccio, Corsica, she goes by the stage name Alizée — the feminine form of "alizé" meaning "trade wind". She was discovered by Mylène Farmer, following her winning performance in the talent show, "Graines de Star", in 1999. While working with Mylène Farmer and Laurent Boutonnat, Alizée came up with two albums — both of which were hits inside and outside of France.
