Liverpool is a city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England. Its population in 2019 was approximately , making it the tenth-largest English district by population. Liverpool's metropolitan area is the fifth-largest in the United Kingdom with a population of 2.24 million.
Liverpool is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in North West England's county of Lancashire. It became a borough in 1207, a city in 1880, and a county borough independent of Lancashire in 1889. Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along with general cargo, freight, and raw materials such as coal and cotton, merchants were involved in the slave trade. In the 19th century, Liverpool was a major port of departure for English and Irish emigrants to North America. It was also home to both the Cunard and White Star Lines, and was the port of registry of the ocean liners , , , and .
In 2019, Liverpool was ranked fifth on the list of the most visited UK cities. It is noted for its culture, architecture, and transport links. The city is closely associated with the arts, especially music; the popularity of the Beatles, who are widely regarded as the most influential musical group in history, cemented the city's status as a tourist destination. Since then, Liverpool has continued to produce many notable musicians and record from the city have produced 56 No. 1 hit singles, more than any other city in the world. It also has a long-standing reputation as the origin of various , , , , , , and . The city has the second-highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and listed parks in the UK; only the capital, London, has more. The Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City includes the Pier Head, Albert Dock, and William Brown Street. In sports, the city is best known for being the home of Premier League football teams Liverpool FC and Everton FC, with matches between the two being known as the Merseyside derby. The annual Grand National horse race takes place at Aintree Racecourse.
Several areas of Liverpool city centre were granted World Heritage Site status by UNESCO in 2004, and the city's vast collection of parks and open spaces has been described as the "most important in the country" by England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest. Its status as a port city historically attracted a diverse population from a wide range of cultures, primarily Ireland, Norway, and Wales. It is also home to the oldest black community in the UK and the oldest Chinese community in Europe. Natives of Liverpool (and occasionally longtime residents) are formally referred to as "Liverpudlians" but are more often called "Scousers", a reference to the form of stew made popular by sailors in the city, which also became the most common name for the local accent and dialect. The city celebrated its 800th anniversary in 2007 and was named the 2008 European Capital of Culture, which it shared with the Norwegian city of Stavanger. Its designation as European Capital of Culture resulted in a sharp uptick in the city's fortunes, as the money gained from the EU was spent on regenerating large parts of the city that had become run down.
Origins of the name.
The name comes from the Old English "lifer", meaning thick or muddy water, and "pōl", meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as "Liuerpul". According to the "Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names", "The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained". The place appearing as "Leyrpole", in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool. Other origins of the name have been suggested, including "elverpool", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey. The adjective "Liverpudlian" was first recorded in 1833.
Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form “Leverpool” with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) &gt; Danetry, never-do-well &gt; ne’er-do-well).
In the nineteenth century, some Welsh publications used the name “Lle’r Pwll” (“(the) place (of) the pool”), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that “Lle’r Pwll” was the original form.
Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a nineteenth-century coining. “Llyn” is pool, but “lleifiad” has no obvious meaning. Professor G. Melville Richards (1910‐1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in “Place Names of North Wales”, does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that “lleifiad” is used as a Welsh equivalent of “Liver”.
A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give “lleifiad” is possible, but unproven.
History.
Early history.
King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool. By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 500. The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in an H shape: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).
In the 17th century there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including an eighteen-day siege in 1644. In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, "Liverpool Merchant", set sail for Africa, Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament, although arguably the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development. Since Roman times, the nearby city of Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey.
As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715. Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.
19th century.
By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine.
In her poem "Liverpool" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.
Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, "the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself."
For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London, and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer. Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.
In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.
As early as 1851 the city was described as "the New York of Europe". During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship.
20th century.
The postwar period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to integrate veterans into the economy. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including police strikes in London among the Metropolitan Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the UK, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919 they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing.
In this period, race riots also took place in Cardiff, Newport and Barry, and there had been incidents in Glasgow, South Shields, London, Hull and Salford. Similarly, racial riots of whites against blacks took place across the United States in numerous industrial cities, so that a black leader termed the period of time Red Summer. In that first postwar year, there were also riots in Caribbean and South African cities.
The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. Thousands of families were relocated from the inner-city to new suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though this is largely subjective. Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city.
Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's. The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.
The "Luftwaffe" made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Much of the immediate reconstruction of the city centre has been deeply unpopular. It was as flawed as much subsequent town planning renewal in the 1950s and 1960s. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. Since 1952 Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war.
A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive.
The construction of suburban public housing expanded after the Second World War. Some of the older inner-city areas were redeveloped for new homes.
In the 1960s Liverpool was the centre of the "Merseybeat" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music for years and were internationally popular. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed for years together; they were the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980 after the Beatles stopped performing together. Liverpool airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.
Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool in 1974 became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside.
From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were thrown out of jobs. By the early 1980s unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK, standing at 17% by January 1982. This was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression 50 years previously.
In the later 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. Since the mid-1990s the city has enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average.
 At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today.
21st century.
To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice.
Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism has also become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy.
In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 m development based on Paradise Street. This produced the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed 'Liverpool ONE,' the centre opened in May 2008.
In 2007, the city celebrated the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool, for which a number of events were planned. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The main celebrations, in September 2008, included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, and represents the "eight legs" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel.
Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration has continued through to the start of the early 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects include new buildings in the Commercial District, the King's Dock, Mann Island, the Lime Street Gateway, the Baltic Triangle, the RopeWalks, and the Edge Lane Gateway. All projects could be eclipsed by the Liverpool Waters scheme, which if built will cost in the region of £5.5billion and be one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Liverpool Waters is a mixed-use development planned to contain one of Europe's largest skyscraper clusters. The project received outline planning permission in 2012, despite fierce opposition from such groups as UNESCO, which claimed that it would adversely affect Liverpool's World Heritage status.
In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014, and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.
Inventions and innovations.
[[File:Liverpool School Tropical Medical School 3.JPG|thumb|left |The [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]], the first such school in the world]]
Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams, and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool ([[Wapping Tunnel]]). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and [[Cardiff]].
The first [[Royal School for the Blind (Liverpool)|School for the Blind]], [[Mechanics' Institutes|Mechanics' Institute]], High School for Girls, council house, and Juvenile Court were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the [[RSPCA]], [[NSPCC]], [[Age Concern]], [[Relate]], and [[Citizen's Advice Bureau]] all evolved from work in the city.
The first [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] station, public bath and wash-house, sanitary act, medical officer for health ([[William Henry Duncan]]), district nurse, [[slum clearance]], purpose-built ambulance, X-ray medical diagnosis, school of tropical medicine ([[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]]), motorised municipal fire-engine, free school meal, cancer research centre, and [[zoonosis]] research centre all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to [[Ronald Ross]], professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world. [[Orthopaedic surgery]] was pioneered in Liverpool by [[Hugh Owen Thomas]], and modern medical anaesthetics by [[Thomas Cecil Gray]].
The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by [[James Newlands]], appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer. Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association and the first [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales|Institute of Accountants]]. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.
In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library ([[The Lyceum, Liverpool|The Lyceum]]), athenaeum society ([[Liverpool Athenaeum]]), arts centre ([[Bluecoat Chambers]]), and public art conservation centre ([[National Conservation Centre]]). It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra ([[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]]) and repertory theatre ([[Liverpool Playhouse]]).
[[File:Oriel Chambers - geograph.org.uk - 530888.jpg|thumb|right|[[Oriel Chambers]], the first "modern" building in the world]]
In 1864, [[Peter Ellis (architect)|Peter Ellis]] built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, [[Oriel Chambers]], which was a prototype of the [[skyscraper]]. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey. It was the largest store in the world at the time.
Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by [[John Hulley]] and Charles Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook. The programme of the first modern Olympiad in [[Athens]] in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics. In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the [[British Olympic Association]]. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the [[Olympic Charter|International Olympic Charter]].
Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]], a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884. The [[Mersey Railway]], opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary and the world's first deep-level underground stations ([[Liverpool James Street railway station]]).
In 1889, borough engineer [[John Alexander Brodie]] invented the football goal net. He also was a pioneer in the use of [[pre-fabricated]] housing and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road ([[A5058 road|A5058]]) and intercity highway ([[East Lancashire Road]]), as well as the [[Queensway Tunnel]] linking Liverpool and [[Birkenhead]]. Described as "the eighth wonder of the world" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years.
In 1897, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] filmed Liverpool, including what is believed to be the world's first [[tracking shot]], taken from the [[Liverpool Overhead Railway]], the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use [[electric multiple unit]]s, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator.
Liverpool inventor [[Frank Hornby]] was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: [[Meccano]], [[Hornby Model Railways]], and [[Dinky Toys]]. The [[British Interplanetary Society]], founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the "[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]", is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.
In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside of London to be awarded [[blue plaques]] by English Heritage in recognition of the "significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life".
Government.
Liverpool is governed by a [[Unitary Authority]], as when [[Merseyside County Council]] was disbanded civic functions were returned to a district borough level. However several services such as the [[Merseyside Police|police]] and [[Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service|fire and rescue service]], continue to be run at a county-wide level. The city also elects four [[member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|members of Parliament]] (MPs) to the [[Westminster Parliament]].
Mayor and local council.
[[File:LpoolTownHallOM.jpg|thumb|left|The late Georgian [[Liverpool Town Hall]]]]
The City of Liverpool is governed by the [[Directly elected mayor of Liverpool]] and [[Liverpool City Council]], and is one of six metropolitan boroughs that combine to make up the [[Liverpool City Region]]. The mayor is elected by the citizens of Liverpool every four years and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the council. The council's 90 elected [[councillors]] who represent local communities throughout the city, are responsible for scrutinising the mayor's decisions, setting the budget, and policy framework of the city. The mayor's responsibility is to be a powerful voice for the city both nationally and internationally, to lead, build investor confidence, and to direct resources to economic priorities. The mayor also exchanges direct dialogue with government ministers and the prime minister through his seat at the Cabinet of Mayors. Discussions include pressing decision-makers in the government on local issues as well as building relationships with the other [[directly elected mayors in England and Wales]]. The mayor is [[Joe Anderson (politician)|Joe Anderson]].
The City of Liverpool effectively has two mayors. As well as the directly elected mayor, there is the ceremonial lord mayor (or civic mayor) who is elected by the full city council at its annual general meeting in May and stands for one year in office. The lord mayor acts as the "first citizen" of Liverpool and is responsible for promoting the city, supporting local charities and community groups as well as representing the city at civic events. The [[Lord Mayor]] is Councillor Christine Banks.
For local elections the city is split into 30 local council wards, which in alphabetical order are:
During the local elections [[2011 Liverpool Council election|held in May 2011]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from regaining power for the first time in 12 years, during the [[2010 Liverpool Council election|previous elections in May 2010]]. The Labour Party gained 11 seats during the election, taking their total to 62 seats, compared with the 22 held by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Of the remaining seats, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] won three and [[Green Party of England and Wales|the Green Party]] claimed two. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], one of the three major political parties in the UK had no representation on Liverpool City Council.
In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall on Capital of Culture funding.
While Liverpool through most of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a municipal stronghold of Toryism, support for the Conservative Party recently has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the [[Monetarism|monetarist]] economic policies of prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] after her [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] victory contributed to high unemployment in the city which did not begin to fall for many years. Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however the city has seen hard times under Labour governments as well, particularly in the [[Winter of Discontent]] (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom but also suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied.
Liverpool City Region Combined Authority.
The City of Liverpool is one of the six constituent local government districts of the [[Liverpool City Region]]. Since 1 April 2014, some of the city's responsibilities have been pooled with neighbouring authorities within the metropolitan area and subsumed into the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]].
The [[combined authority]] has effectively become the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and The Mayor of Liverpool, along with the five other leaders from neighbouring local government districts, take strategic decisions over economic development, transport, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure.
As of July 2015, negotiations are currently taking place between the UK national government and the combined authority over a possible devolution deal to confer greater powers on the region. Discussions include whether to introduce an elected ‘Metro Mayor' to oversee the entire metropolitan area.
Parliamentary constituencies and MPs.
Liverpool has four [[United Kingdom constituencies|parliamentary constituencies]] entirely within the city, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]]: [[Liverpool Riverside (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Riverside]], [[Liverpool Walton (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Walton]], [[Liverpool Wavertree (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Wavertree]] and [[Liverpool West Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool West Derby]]. At the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|last general election]], all were won by Labour with representation being from [[Kim Johnson (politician)|Kim Johnson]], [[Dan Carden]], [[Paula Barker]] and [[Ian Byrne (politician)|Ian Byrne]] respectively. Due to [[Constituencies in the United Kingdom general election, 2010|boundary changes]] prior to the 2010 election, the [[Liverpool Garston (UK Parliament constituency)|Liverpool Garston]] constituency was merged with most of [[Knowsley South (UK Parliament constituency)|Knowsley South]] to form the [[Garston and Halewood (UK Parliament constituency)|Garston and Halewood]] cross-boundary seat. At the most 2019 election this seat was won by [[Maria Eagle]] of the Labour Party.

Environment.
[[File:Liverpool Bay.png|thumb|[[Satellite imagery]] showing [[Liverpool Bay]], Liverpool and the wider [[Merseyside]] area]]
Liverpool has been described as having "the most splendid setting of any English city." At (53.4, −2.98), northwest of London, located on the [[Liverpool Bay]] of the [[Irish Sea]] the city of Liverpool is built across a ridge of [[sandstone]] hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]].
The [[Mersey Estuary]] separates Liverpool from the [[Wirral Peninsula]]. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to [[Bootle]], [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] and [[Maghull]] in south [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] to the north, and [[Kirkby]], [[Huyton]], [[Prescot]] and [[Halewood]] in [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]] to the east.
Climate.
Liverpool experiences a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: "Cfb"), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and Temperature records have been kept at Bidston since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as 1845. Bidston closed down in 2002 but the [[Met Office]] also has a weather station at [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]]. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from on 21 December 2010 to on 2 August 1990, although, Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of on 19 July 2006.
The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5hrs in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5hrs in July 2013.
Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds have been seen in 1998, 2014 and 2018.
During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom. Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008 while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012. Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 4 September 1974 and the latest on 2 June 1975.
Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being October 1787, which recorded of rain and the driest being February 1932, with . However, droughts can occasionally become a problem, especially, but not exclusively, in the summer, this happened most recently in 2018. However, the longest run of days without any rainfall was 41 days between 16 July and 25 August 1995. The driest year on record was 1991, with of rainfall and the wettest was 1792, with .
Since Bidston closed down in 2002, new records are:

Suburbs and districts.
Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include:
Green Liverpool.
In 2010 Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust Commissioned [[The Mersey Forest]] to complete "A Green Infrastructure Strategy" for the city.
Green belt.
Liverpool is a core urban element of a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.
Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] throughout the borough, at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.
The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council and the size in the city amounts to .
Demography.
Population.
The city.
At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 UK Census]] the recorded population of Liverpool was 466,415, a 6.1% increase on the figure of 439,473 recorded in the 2001 census. The population of the central Liverpool local authority peaked in the 1930s with 846,101 recorded in the 1931 census, before suburbanisation and the establishment of [[new towns]] in the region. As with many British cities including [[London]] and [[Manchester]], the city centre covered by the Liverpool council area had experienced negative population growth since the 1931 census. Much of the population loss was as a result of large-scale resettlement programmes to nearby areas introduced in the aftermath of the Second World War, with satellite towns such as [[Kirkby, Merseyside|Kirkby]], [[Skelmersdale]] and [[Runcorn]] seeing a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).
Liverpool's population is younger than that of England as a whole, with per cent of its population under the age of 30, compared to an English average of per cent. , 66 per cent of the population was of working age.
Urban and metropolitan area.
Liverpool is the largest local authority by population, GDP and area in Merseyside. Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Liverpool is defined as a standalone [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS3 area by the ONS for statistical purpose]], and makes up part of the NUTS2 area "Merseyside" along with East Merseyside (Knowsley, St Helens and Halton), Sefton and the Wirral. The population of this area was 1,513,306 based on 2014 estimates.
The "[[Liverpool Urban Area]]" is a term used by the [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS) to denote the [[urban area]] around the city to the east of the [[River Mersey]]. The contiguous built-up area extends beyond the area administered by [[Liverpool City Council]] into adjoining local authority areas, particularly parts of [[Metropolitan Borough of Sefton|Sefton]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Knowsley|Knowsley]]. As defined by ONS, the area extends as far east as [[Haydock]] and [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]]. Unlike the Metropolitan area, the Urban Area does not include The Wirral or its contiguous areas. The population of this area as of 2011 was 864,211.
The "[[Liverpool City Region]]" is an economic partnership between local authorities in Merseyside under the umbrella of the [[Liverpool City Region Combined Authority]] as defined by the Mersey Partnership. The area covers Merseyside and the [[Borough of Halton]] and has an estimated population between 1,500,000 and 2,000,000 and.
In 2006 ESPON (now ([[European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion]]) released a study defining a "Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area" as a functional urban area consisting of contiguous urban areas, labour pool, and commuter "Travel To Work Areas". The analysis grouped the [[Merseyside]] metropolitan county with the borough of [[Halton (borough)|Halton]], [[Wigan]] in Greater Manchester, the city of [[Chester]] as well as number of towns in Lancashire and [[Cheshire]] including [[Ormskirk]] and [[Warrington]], estimating the polynuclear metropolitan area to have a population of 2,241,000 people.
Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area, or [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]].
Ethnicity.
[[File:LPool-wyrdlight-802532Z.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown Gate, [[Chinatown, Liverpool]]]]
According to data from the 2011 census, 84.8 per cent of Liverpool's population was [[White British]], 1.4 per cent [[White Irish]], 2.6 per cent White Other, 4.1 per cent [[Asian British|Asian or Asian British]] (including 1.1 per cent British Indian and 1.7 per cent British Chinese), 2.6 per cent [[Black British|Black or Black British]] (including 1.8 per cent Black African) and 2.5 per cent [[British Mixed-Race|mixed-race]]. 1.8 per cent of respondents were from other ethnic groups.
According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool (With surname origin), followed with their population are; 
Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest [[Black people|Black]] community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Black Liverpudlians can trace their ancestors in the city back ten generations. Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men. Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large [[British African-Caribbean people|African-Caribbean]], [[Ghanaians in the United Kingdom|Ghanaian]], and [[Somalis in the United Kingdom|Somali]] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations.
The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's [[Chinatown, Liverpool|Chinatown]] arrived as seamen in the 19th century. The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. [[Lita Roza]], a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry.
The city is also known for its large Irish population and its historically large [[Welsh people|Welsh]] population. In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as "the capital of North Wales." Following the start of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States. By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish. At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the [[Republic of Ireland]], while 0.54 per cent were born in [[Northern Ireland]], but many more Liverpudlians are of Welsh or Irish ancestry.
Other contemporary ethnicities include [[British Indian|Indian]], [[Latin American migration to the United Kingdom|Latin American]], [[Malaysians in the United Kingdom|Malaysian]], and [[Yemenis in the United Kingdom|Yemeni]] communities, which number several thousand each.
Religion.
[[File:Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 1304.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral of Christ the King]]]]
The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings, including two Christian cathedrals.
Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.
The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican [[Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool|Our Lady and St Nicholas]], colloquially known as "the sailors church", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the [[Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas]] (built in the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture]] style), and the [[Gustav Adolf Church, Liverpool|Gustav Adolf Church]] (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles).
Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]], which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual [[Liverpool Shakespeare Festival]], has one of the longest [[nave]]s, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], on Mount Pleasant next to [[Liverpool Science Park]], was initially planned to be even larger. Of [[Sir Edwin Lutyens]]'s original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by [[Sir Frederick Gibberd]]. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design it still incorporates the largest panel of [[stained glass]] in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called [[Hope Street, Liverpool|Hope Street]], a coincidence which pleases believers. The cathedral is colloquially referred to as "Paddy's Wigwam" due to its shape.
[[File:Al-Rahma Mosque, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Al-Rahma Mosque]] in the Toxteth area of Liverpool]]
Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed [[Moorish Revival]] [[Princes Road Synagogue]] is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's [[Moorish Revival]] synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool. Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant [[Jewish]] community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the [[Greenbank Park]] area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a [[Lubavitch]] [[Chabad House]] and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000. The [[Liverpool Talmudical College]] existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.
Liverpool also has a [[Hindu]] community, with a [[Mandir]] on [[Edge Lane]], [[Edge Hill, Merseyside|Edge Hill]]. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there. Liverpool also has the [[Guru Nanak]] [[Sikh]] [[Gurdwara]] in [[Wavertree]] and a [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]] Centre in the same area.
The city had the earliest mosque in England, and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by [[William Abdullah Quilliam]], a lawyer who had converted to [[Islam]], and set up the [[Liverpool Muslim Institute]] in a [[terraced house]] on West Derby Road. The building was used as a house of worship until 1908, when it was sold to the City Council and converted into offices. Plans have been accepted to re-convert the building where the mosque once stood into a museum. There are three mosques in Liverpool: the largest and main one, [[Al-Rahma mosque]], in the [[Toxteth]] area of the city and a mosque recently opened in the [[Mossley Hill]] district of the city. The third mosque was also recently opened in Toxteth and is on [[Granby Four Streets|Granby Street]].
Demonymy and identity.
Natives of the city of Liverpool are referred to as Liverpudlians, and colloquially as "Scousers", a reference to "[[scouse (food)|scouse]]", a form of stew. The word "Scouse" has also become synonymous with the [[Scouse|Liverpool accent and dialect]]. Many people "self-identify" as Liverpudlians or Scousers without actually being born or living within the city boundaries of Liverpool.
Economy.
[[File:Buildings near Princes Dock, Liverpool - from the Mersey Ferry.jpg|thumb|Apartment buildings within Liverpool's new [[Liverpool City Centre#Commercial District|commercial district]]]]
The Economy of Liverpool is one of the largest within the United Kingdom, sitting at the centre of one of the [[North West of England#Economy|two core economies]] within the [[North West of England]]. In 2006, the city's [[Gross value added|GVA]] was £7,626 million, providing a per capita figure of £17,489, which was above the North West average. Liverpool's economy has seen strong growth since the mid-1990s, with its GVA increasing 71.8% between 1995 and 2006 and employment increasing 12% between 1998 and 2006. GDP per capita was estimated to stand at $32,121 in 2014, and total GDP at $65.8 billion.
In common with much of the rest of the UK today, Liverpool's economy is dominated by [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector industries]], both public and private. In 2007, over 60% of all employment in the city was in the public administration, education, health, banking, finance and insurance sectors. Over recent years there has also been significant growth in the [[knowledge economy]] of Liverpool with the establishment of the [[Liverpool Knowledge Quarter]] in sectors such as media and life sciences. Liverpool's rich architectural base has also helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London, including doubling for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York, Paris and Rome.
[[File:Liverpool One 22.jpg|thumb|left|[[Liverpool One]] has helped move the city into the top five retail destinations in the UK]]
Another important component of Liverpool's economy are the tourism and [[leisure industry|leisure sectors]]. Liverpool is the sixth most visited UK city and one of the 100 most visited cities in the world by international tourists. In 2008, during the city's [[European Capital of Culture]] celebrations, overnight visitors brought £188m into the local economy, while tourism as a whole is worth approximately £1.3bn a year to Liverpool. The city's new [[Liverpool Cruise Terminal|cruise liner terminal]], which is situated close to the [[Pier Head]], also makes Liverpool one of the few places in the world where cruise ships are able to berth right in the centre of the city. Other recent developments in Liverpool such as the [[Echo Arena]] and [[Liverpool One]] have made Liverpool an important leisure centre with the latter helping to lift Liverpool into the top five retail destinations in the UK. [[File:Range Rover Evoque SD4 4WD Prestige – Frontansicht, 12. Juli 2014, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumbnail|The [[Range Rover Evoque]] is manufactured at [[Jaguar Land Rover]]'s plant [[Halewood Body &amp; Assembly|at Halewood]].]]
Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the [[Port of Liverpool|city's port]] and manufacturing base, although a smaller proportion of total employment is today derived from the port. Nonetheless the city remains one of the most important ports in the United Kingdom, handling over 32.2m tonnes of cargo in 2008. A new multimillion-pound expansion to the Port of Liverpool, [[Liverpool2]], is scheduled to be operational from the end of 2015, and is projected to greatly increase the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle. Liverpool is also home to the UK headquarters of many shipping lines including Japanese firm [[Nippon Yusen|NYK]] and Danish firm [[Maersk Line]], whilst shipping firm [[Atlantic Container Line]] has recently invested significant amounts in expanding its Liverpool operations, with a new headquarters currently under construction. Future plans to redevelop the city's northern dock system, in a project known as [[Liverpool Waters]], could see £5.5bn invested in the city over the next 50 years, creating 17,000 new jobs.
Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the [[Jaguar Land Rover]] [[Halewood]] plant where the [[Range Rover Evoque]] model is assembled.
Landmarks and recent development projects.
[[File:The Three Graces, Liverpool - 2012-05-27.jpg|thumb|Liverpool's Three Graces, the [[Royal Liver Building]], [[Cunard Building]] and [[Port of Liverpool Building]] at the [[Pier Head]]]]
Liverpool's history means that there are a considerable variety of [[architectural style]]s found within the city, ranging from 16th century [[Tudor architecture|Tudor buildings]] to modern-day [[contemporary architecture]]. The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the [[British Empire]]. There are over [[Listed buildings in Liverpool|2,500 listed buildings]] in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed and 85 are Grade II* listed. The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from [[City of Westminster|Westminster]] and more Georgian houses than the city of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by [[English Heritage]], as England's finest Victorian city. The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Known as the [[Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City]], the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of [[international trade]] and [[dock (maritime)|docking]] technology.
Waterfront and docks.
[[File:Albert Dock, Liverpool - DSC00940.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]] contains the UK's largest collection of Grade I listed buildings as well as being the most visited multi-use attraction outside London]]
As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed [[wet dock]] (the [[Old Dock]]) in 1715 and the first ever [[hydraulic]] lifting [[crane (machine)|cranes]]. The best-known dock in Liverpool is the [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]], which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain. Built under the guidance of [[Jesse Hartley]], it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. The Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the [[Merseyside Maritime Museum]], [[International Slavery Museum]], [[Tate Liverpool]] and [[The Beatles Story]]. North of the city centre is [[Stanley Dock]], home to the [[Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse]], which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.
One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the [[Pier Head]], renowned for the trio of buildings – the [[Royal Liver Building]], the [[Cunard Building]] and the [[Port of Liverpool Building]] – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the "Three Graces", these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built-in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of Maritime Liverpool and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.
[[File:Bluecoat Jan 6 2010 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bluecoat Chambers]], the oldest building in Liverpool city centre]]
In recent years, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Amongst the notable recent developments are the [[Museum of Liverpool]], the construction of the [[Liverpool Arena]] and BT Convention Centre on [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|Kings Dock]], [[Alexandra Tower, Liverpool|Alexandra Tower]] and [[1 Princes Dock]] on [[Prince's Dock, Liverpool|Prince's Dock]] and [[Liverpool Marina]] around [[Coburg Dock|Coburg]] and [[Brunswick Dock]]s. [[The Wheel of Liverpool]] opened on 25 March 2010.
However, plans to redevelop parts of the Liverpool have been marred by [[controversy]]. In December 2016, a newly formed company called [[North Point Global Ltd.]] was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the "New Chinatown" banner. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with glossy advertisements and videos, the "New Chinatown" development failed to materialise. In January 2018, the "Liverpool Echo" and "Asia Times" revealed that the site remained sans any construction, North Point Global as well as its subcontractor "Bilt" had both declared [[bankruptcy]], and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them. Five similar development projects, mostly targeting individual Chinese and Hong Kong based citizens, were suspended due to financial misappropriations.
Commercial district and cultural quarter.
[[File:Victoria Street, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|Victoria Street like many streets in the city centre is lined with dozens of listed buildings]]
Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought, then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.
The [[commercial district]] is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] layout. Having developed over a period of three centuries the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's World Heritage site.
[[File:St George's Hall, Liverpool - geograph.org.uk - 500194.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]]]]
The oldest building in the area is the [[Grade I]] [[listed building|listed]] [[Liverpool Town Hall]], which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of [[Georgian architecture]], the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain. Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed [[Bank of England, Liverpool|Bank of England Building]], constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank. Amongst the other buildings in the area are the [[Tower Buildings, Liverpool|Tower Buildings]], [[Albion House, Liverpool|Albion House]] (the former [[White Star Line]] headquarters), the [[Municipal Buildings, Liverpool|Municipal Buildings]] and [[Oriel Chambers]], which is considered to be one of the earliest [[Modernist]] style buildings ever built.
[[File:Municipal Buildings, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|[[Municipal Buildings, Liverpool|Municipal Buildings]]]]
The area around [[William Brown Street]] is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the [[William Brown Library]], [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library|Picton Reading Rooms]] and [[World Museum Liverpool]]. The area is dominated by [[neo-classical architecture]], of which the most prominent, [[St. George's Hall, Liverpool|St George's Hall]], is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe. A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with "[[SPQR|S.P.Q.L.]]" (Latin "senatus populusque Liverpudliensis"), meaning "the senate and people of Liverpool". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including [[Wellington's Column]] and the [[Steble Fountain]]. Many others are located around the area, particularly in [[St John's Gardens, Liverpool|St John's Gardens]], which was specifically developed for this purpose. The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the [[Roman Forum]].
Other notable landmarks.
[[File:Speke Hall, Liverpool.jpg|thumb|right|[[Speke Hall]] [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] is one of Liverpool's oldest buildings]]
[[File:West Tower from ground level.jpg|thumb|upright|[[West Tower]] has been the [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool|city's tallest building]] since completion in 2008]]
While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is [[Speke Hall]], a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]] [[manor house]] located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598. The building is one of the few remaining [[timber framed]] Tudor houses left in the [[north of England]] and is particularly noted for its [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian]] interiors, which was added in the mid-19th century. In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former [[manor house]]s including [[Croxteth Hall]] and [[Woolton Hall]], which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.
The oldest building within the city centre is the [[Grade I]] [[listed building|listed]] [[Bluecoat Chambers]], which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style, the building was influenced in part by the work of [[Christopher Wren]] and was originally the home of the [[Liverpool Blue Coat School|Bluecoat School]] (who later moved to a larger site in [[Wavertree]] in the south of the city). Since 1908 it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.
[[File:Liverpool Kathedrale 3.JPG|thumb|left|[[Liverpool Cathedral]] is regarded as one of the greatest buildings of the twentieth century and is one of the largest church buildings in the world]]
Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it. The [[Liverpool Cathedral|Anglican Cathedral]], which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain and the [[List of largest church buildings in the world|fifth largest in the world]]. Designed and built in [[Gothic style]], it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century and was described by former British [[Poet Laureate]], [[John Betjeman]], as 'one of the great buildings of the world'. The Roman Catholic [[Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first Cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.
In recent years, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. The largest of these developments has been [[Liverpool One]], which has seen almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space. Around the north of the city centre several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the [[RIBA]] award-winning [[Unity Buildings]] and [[West Tower]], which at 140m is [[List of tallest buildings and structures in Liverpool|Liverpool's tallest building]]. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including [[Central Village, Liverpool|Central Village]] / Circus, the [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]] gateway, and the highly ambitious [[Liverpool Waters]].
There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the [[art deco]] [[Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport Hotel|former terminal building]] of [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport|Speke Airport]], the [[University of Liverpool]]'s [[Victoria Building, University of Liverpool|Victoria Building]], (which provided the inspiration for the term "[[Red Brick universities|Red Brick University]]"), and the [[Britannia Adelphi Hotel|Adelphi Hotel]], which was in that past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.
Parks and gardens.
The English Heritage National Register of Historic Parks describes Merseyside's [[:Category:Parks and commons in Liverpool|Victorian Parks]] as collectively the "most important in the country". The city of Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.
Transport.
[[File:Benkid77 Kingsway Tunnel Approach Road 2 090809.JPG|thumb|right|The Wallasey entrance to the [[Kingsway Tunnel]]. Liverpool's skyline is visible in the background]]
Transport in Liverpool is primarily centred on the city's road and rail networks, both of which are extensive and provide links across the United Kingdom. Liverpool has an extensive local public transport network, which is managed by [[Merseytravel]], and includes buses, trains and ferries. Additionally, the city also has an international airport and a major port, both of which provides links to locations outside the country.
National and international travel.
Road links.
As a major city, Liverpool has direct road links with many other areas within England. To the east, the [[M62 motorway]] connects Liverpool with [[Kingston-upon-Hull|Hull]] and along the route provides links to several large cities, including [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]] and [[Bradford]]. The M62 also provides a connection to both the [[M6 motorway|M6]] and [[M1 motorway]]s, providing indirect links to more distant areas including [[Birmingham]], London, [[Nottingham]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Sheffield]]. To the west of the city, the [[Kingsway Tunnel|Kingsway]] and [[Queensway Tunnel]]s connect Liverpool with the [[Wirral Peninsula]], including [[Birkenhead]], and [[Wallasey]]. The [[A41 road]] and [[M53 motorway]], which both begin in Birkenhead, link to [[Cheshire]] and [[Shropshire]] and via the [[A55 road|A55]], to [[North Wales]]. To the south, Liverpool is connected to [[Widnes]] and [[Warrington]] via the [[A562 road|A562]] and across the [[River Mersey]] to [[Runcorn]], via the [[Silver Jubilee Bridge|Silver Jubilee]] and [[Mersey Gateway]] bridges.
[[File:Lime street july 2010.jpg|thumb|right|[[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Liverpool Lime Street Station]]]]
Rail links.
Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by [[Merseyrail]] and provides links throughout Merseyside and beyond (see [[Liverpool#Local travel|Local travel]] below), while the national network, which is managed by [[Network Rail]], provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary mainline station is [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street station]], which is the terminus for several lines into the city, with numerous destinations, including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with [[British Rail Class 390|Pendolino]] trains), [[Birmingham]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], Manchester, [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Leeds]], [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], [[Sheffield]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Norwich]]. In the south of the city, [[Liverpool South Parkway]] provides a connection to the city's airport.
Port.
The [[Port of Liverpool]] is one of Britain's largest ports, providing passenger ferry services across the [[Irish Sea]] to [[Belfast]], Dublin and the [[Isle of Man]]. Services are provided by several companies, including the [[Isle of Man Steam Packet Company]], [[P&amp;O Ferries]] and [[Stena Line]]. In 2007, a new [[Liverpool Cruise Terminal|cruise terminal]] was opened in Liverpool, located alongside the [[Pier Head]] in the city centre.
November 2016 saw the official opening of [[Liverpool2]], an extension to the port that allows [[Post-Panamax#Post-Panamax ships|post-Panamax]] vessels to dock in Liverpool.
[[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] runs into Liverpool city centre via [[Liverpool Canal Link]] at Pier Head since 2009.
[[Liverpool Cruise Terminal]] in the city centre provides long-distance passenger cruises, [[Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines]] [[MS Black Watch (1971)|MS Black Watch]] and [[Cruise &amp; Maritime Voyages]] [[MS Magellan]] using the terminal to depart to [[Iceland]], [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Norway]].

[[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]], which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. In 2008, the airport handled over 5.3 million passengers and today offers services to 68 destinations, including Berlin, Rome, Milan, Paris, Barcelona and Zürich. The airport is primarily served by [[low-cost airlines]], notably [[Ryanair]] and [[Easyjet]], although it does provide additional charter services in the summer.
Local travel.
Trains.
[[File:Liverpool Central - Northern Line - Platforms 1 and 2 - 02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Merseyrail]] network has extensive underground sections within the city centre. [[Liverpool Central railway station|Liverpool Central]] is the UK's busiest underground station outside London]]
Liverpool's [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom|local rail]] network is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network consists of three lines: the [[Northern Line (Merseyrail)|Northern Line]], which runs to [[Southport]], [[Ormskirk]], [[Kirkby]] and [[Hunts Cross]]; the [[Wirral Line]], which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to [[New Brighton, Merseyside|New Brighton]], [[West Kirby]], [[Chester]] and [[Ellesmere Port]]; and the [[City Line (Merseyrail)|City Line]], which begins at [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street]], providing links to [[St Helens, Merseyside|St Helens]], [[Wigan]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Warrington]] and [[Manchester]].
The network is predominantly electric. Electrification of the City Line was completed in 2015. The two lines operated by Merseyrail are the busiest British urban commuter networks outside London, covering of track, with an average of 110,000 passenger journeys per weekday. Services are operated by the [[Merseyrail]] franchise and managed by [[Merseytravel]]. Local services on the City Line are operated by [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]] rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within the city centre the majority of the network is underground, with four city centre stations and over of tunnels.
Buses.
[[File:Benkid77 Mersey Ferry 120605.JPG|thumb|[[MV Royal Iris of the Mersey]] is one of three ferries that provide cross river services between Liverpool and the Wirral]]
Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by [[Merseytravel]] and are run by several different companies, including [[Arriva North West|Arriva]] and [[Stagecoach Merseyside|Stagecoach]]. The two principal termini for local buses are [[Queen Square Bus Station]] (located near [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station|Lime Street railway station]]) for services north and east of the city, and [[Liverpool One Bus Station|Liverpool One Bus Station formerly known as Paradise Street Bus Interchange]] (located near the [[Royal Albert Dock, Liverpool|Albert Dock]]) for services to the south and east. Cross-river services to the [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A [[night bus service]] also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and Merseyside.
City Sights and City explorer by Maghull coaches offer a [[tour bus service]].
[[National Express]] also operates.
Mersey Ferry.
The cross river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the [[Mersey Ferry]], is managed and operated by [[Merseytravel]], with services operating between the [[Pier Head]] in Liverpool and both [[Woodside, Merseyside|Woodside]] in [[Birkenhead]] and [[Seacombe]] in [[Wallasey]]. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and during weekends. Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the [[River Mersey]] and surrounding areas.
Cycling.
In May 2014, the CityBike hire scheme was launched in the city. The scheme provides access to over 1,000 bikes stationed at over 140 docking stations across the city.
[[National Cycle Route 56]], [[National Cycle Route 62]] and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool.
Culture.
As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife amongst others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of [[European Capital of Culture]], during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including [[Go Superlambananas!]] and [[La Princesse]].

Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by "Guinness World Records" as the "World Capital City of Pop". Musicians from the city have produced 56 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world. Both the most successful [[The Beatles|male band]] and [[Spice Girls|girl group]] in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of [[the Beatles]] and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the [[Beat Music]] movement, which would eventually lead to the [[British Invasion]]. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including [[Billy J. Kramer]], [[Cilla Black]], [[Gerry and the Pacemakers]] and [[The Searchers (band)|The Searchers]]. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the [[Liverpool poets]], prompted American poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] to proclaim that the city was "the centre of consciousness of the human universe". Other musicians from Liverpool include [[Billy Fury]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]], [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]], [[Frankie Vaughan]], [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]], [[Ladytron]], [[The Zutons]], [[Cast (band)|Cast]], [[Atomic Kitten]] and [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]]. [[The La's]] 1990 hit single "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]" was described by "[[Rolling Stone]]" as a "founding piece of [[Britpop]]’s foundation."
[[File:Philharmonic Hall Liverpool.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]], home of the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]]]]
The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional [[symphony orchestra]] in the UK, the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra]], which is based in the [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool|Philharmonic Hall]]. The chief conductor of the orchestra is [[Vasily Petrenko]]. Sir [[Edward Elgar]] dedicated his [[Pomp and Circumstance#March No. 1 in D|Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1]] to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901. Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré [[Fritz Spiegl]] is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of [[Scouse]], but composed the music to [[Z-cars]] and the [[Radio 4 UK Theme]].
The [[Liverpool Mathew Street Music Festival|Mathew Street Festival]] is an annual street festival that is one of the most important musical events in Liverpool's calendar.

Other well established festivals in the city include [[Africa Oyé]] and [[Brazilica Festival|Brazilica]] which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively. The dance music festival [[Creamfields]] was established by the Liverpool-based [[Cream (nightclub)|Cream]] clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however the [[Echo Arena Liverpool|Echo Arena]] is by far the largest. Opened in 2008 the 11,000-seat arena hosted the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2008|MTV Europe Music Awards]] the same year and since then has held host to world-renowned acts such as [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Elton John]], [[Kanye West]], [[Kasabian]], [[The Killers]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], [[Rihanna]], [[UB40]].
Visual arts.
[[File:Liverpool Cultural Quarter.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Brown Street]], also known as the Cultural Quarter is a World Heritage Site consisting of the [[World Museum]], [[Liverpool Central Library|Central Library]], [[Picton Reading Room and Hornby Library|Picton Reading Room]] and [[Walker Art Gallery]]]]
Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London. [[National Museums Liverpool]] is the only English national collection based wholly outside London. The [[Tate Liverpool]] gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of [[Tate Modern]], the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The [[FACT centre]] hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the [[Walker Art Gallery]] houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of [[Pre-Raphaelite]] art in the world. [[Sudley House]] contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art. Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the University's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by [[John James Audubon|Audubon]] outside the US. A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter [[George Stubbs]] who was born in Liverpool in 1724.
The [[Liverpool Biennial]] festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide. It was during the 2004 festival that [[Yoko Ono]]'s work "My mother is beautiful" caused widespread public protest when photographs of a naked woman's pubic area were exhibited on the main shopping street.

Literature.
[[Felicia Hemans]] (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] [[Consulate general|consul]] in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and [[St. Asaph]] ([[Flintshire (historic)|Flintshire]]), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as "Land of my childhood, my home and my dead". Her first poems, dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who briefly corresponded with her.
A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including [[Daniel Defoe]], [[Washington Irving]], [[Thomas De Quincey]], [[Herman Melville]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] and [[Hugh Walpole]]. [[Daniel Defoe]], after visiting the city, described it, as "one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'".
[[Herman Melville]]'s novel [[Redburn]] deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections. Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856. Charles Dickens visited the city on numerous occasions to give public readings. Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81. Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, [[Jung]] famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.
Of all the poets who are connected with Liverpool, perhaps the greatest is [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], a twentieth-century Greek cultural icon, although he was born in Alexandria. From a wealthy family, his father had business interests in Egypt, London and Liverpool. After his father's death, Cavafy's mother brought him in 1872 at the age of nine to Liverpool, where he spent part of his childhood being educated. He lived first in Balmoral Road, then when the family firm crashed, he lived in poorer circumstances in Huskisson Street. After his father died in 1870, Cavafy and his family settled for a while in Liverpool. In 1876, his family faced financial problems due to the Long Depression of 1873, so, by 1877, they had to move back to Alexandria.
"[[Her Benny]]", a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher [[Silas K. Hocking]], was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime. The prolific writer of adventure novels, [[Harold Edward Bindloss]] (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool.
The writer, docker and political activist [[George Garrett (activist)|George Garrett]] was born in [[Secombe]], on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the [[Unity Theatre, Liverpool|Unity Theatre]] in the 1930s as part of the [[Popular Front]] against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Garrett died in 1966.
The novelist and playwright [[James Hanley (novelist)|James Hanley]] (1897–1985) was born in [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]], Liverpool, in 1897 (not [[Dublin]], nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family. Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. "[[The Furys Chronicle|The Furys]]" (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist [[Gerald Hanley]] (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not [[County Cork]], Ireland, as he claimed). While he published a number of novels he also wrote [[radio drama|radio plays]] for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably "[[The Blue Max]]" (1966). He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of [[Gandhi]] (1964). Novelist [[Beryl Bainbridge]] (1932–2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby [[Formby]]. She was primarily known for her works of [[psychological fiction]], often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the [[Costa Book Awards|Whitbread Awards]] prize for best novel in [[1977 Whitbread Awards|1977]] and [[1996 Whitbread Awards|1996]] and was nominated five times for the [[Booker Prize]]. "[[The Times]]" newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of "The 50 greatest [[British literature|British writers]] since 1945".
[[J. G. Farrell]] was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939. A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his "Empire Trilogy" ("[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]", "[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]" and "[[The Singapore Grip]]"), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44.
[[Helen Forrester]] was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011), who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the [[Great Depression]], including "Twopence to Cross the Mersey" (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the [[Liverpool poets]], who include [[Roger McGough]] and the late [[Adrian Henri]]. An anthology of poems, "[[The Mersey Sound (book)|The Mersey Sound]]", written by Henri, McGough and [[Brian Patten]], has sold well since it was first being published in 1967.
Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside – [[Ramsey Campbell]], [[Clive Barker]] and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, "Spook City" was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool. Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the "Hellraiser" series of films.

The [[University of Liverpool]] was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]]. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science.
[[File:Liverpool Community College Arts Centre - geograph.org.uk - 640908.jpg|thumb|[[Liverpool Community College]]'s Arts Centre]]
[[Liverpool Hope University]], which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe. It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone).
The [[Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine]], founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the [[University of Liverpool]] and houses an anti-venom repository.
[[Liverpool John Moores University]] was previously a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]], and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of [[John Moores (merchant)|Sir John Moores]], one of the founders of the [[Littlewoods Shop Direct Group|Littlewoods]] football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool [[Mechanics Institute]], opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university.

Sports stadiums.
[[File:Panorama of Anfield with new main stand (29676137824).jpg|thumb|left|[[Anfield]], home of [[Liverpool F.C.]]]]
Liverpool is home to the [[Premier League]] football clubs [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Liverpool F.C.]]
[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] has played at [[Anfield]] since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following [[Everton F.C.|Everton's]] departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield is classified as a 4 Star [[UEFA Elite Stadium]] with capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy.
After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to [[Goodison Park]] on the opposite side of [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]]. Goodison Park was the first major football stadium built in England. [[Molineux Stadium|Molineux]] (Wolves' ground) had been opened three years earlier but was still relatively undeveloped. St. James's Park, Newcastle, opened in 1892, was little more than a field. Only Scotland had more advanced grounds. Rangers opened [[Ibrox Stadium|Ibrox]] in 1887, while [[Celtic Park]] was officially inaugurated at the same time as Goodison Park. Everton performed a miraculous transformation at Mere Green, spending up to £3000 on laying out the ground and erecting stands on three sides. For £552 Mr Barton prepared the land at 4½d a square yard. Kelly Brothers of Walton built two uncovered stands each for 4,000 people, and a covered stand seating 3,000, at a total cost of £1,460. Outside, hoardings cost a further £150, gates and sheds cost £132 10s and 12 turnstiles added another £7 15s to the bill.[[File:Goodisonview1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Goodison Park]], home of [[Everton F.C.]]]]
The ground was immediately renamed Goodison Park and proudly opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA. But instead of a match, the 12,000 crowds saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new goal-end stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Main Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the other two stands are refurbished pre-Second World War structures.
Everton is currently looking to relocate. The club have had previously raised the subject before in 1996, and in 2003 were forced to scrap plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at [[King's Dock, Port of Liverpool|King's Dock]] due to financial reasons and also [[The Kirkby Project|Destination Kirkby]] to move just beyond Liverpool's council boundary in [[Kirkby]]. The latest plan is currently being drawn up to move to nearby [[Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium|Bramley-Moore Dock]] on Liverpool's waterfront.
