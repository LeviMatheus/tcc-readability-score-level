"Ten Who Dared" is a movie made by Disney in 1960. It tells the real story of an officer of the United States Army called John Wesley Powell who was the first to travel up the Colorado river with other nine men to make a map of the region, and the dangers they had to face in their trip.
Some people say it is one of the worst movies made by Disney.
