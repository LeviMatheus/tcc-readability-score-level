The Sermon on the Mount is a Biblical speech by Jesus of Nazareth to his followers and a large group of people around AD 30. Jesus gave the speech on the side of a mountain. The most popular part of the speech is the Beatitudes, which are at the beginning of the speech. The sermon also contains the Lord's Prayer. Other popular lines from the Sermon on the Mount are "turn the other cheek", "salt of the Earth", "light of the world", and "judge not, lest ye be judged".
Many Christians believe that the Sermon on the Mount is related to the Ten Commandments. They believe that is very important in explaining how Christians should act towards others.
Interpretation.
The author Christopher Knight says in his book "Hiram Key", that the 'Sermon on the Mount' did not happen. He thinks that Matthew 'stuck all kinds of passages together as though they were spoken one after another to a crowd on a mountain top.' Knight believes that 'the teachings were drafted into this one 'occasion' to avoid interrupting the flow of the overall story.' The "Hiram Key" was created by both Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas.
E. Earle Ellis (Professor of Theology) says that this sermon is Jesus asking believers to live in a way that will be standard in the future kingdom of God. As Ellis says, we are to speak Jesus' words, think his thoughts, and do his deeds. Since this will be the ethic of the future kingdom of God, people should live their lives in a way that will help them be ready to live in God's kingdom.
