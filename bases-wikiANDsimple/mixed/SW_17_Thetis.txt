17 Thetis is a big Main belt asteroid. It is a S-type asteroid, giving it a fairly bright silicate surface.
It was found by R. Luther on April 17, 1852. It was his first asteroid discovery. Its name comes from Thetis, the mother of Achilles in Greek mythology.
One stellar occultation of Thetis was seen from Oregon in 1999. However, the event was not timed.
