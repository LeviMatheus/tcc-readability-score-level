Wilhelm Busch (April 15, 1832 (Wiedensahl near Hannover) - January 9, 1908 (Mechtshausen)) was a German painter and poet who is known for his satirical picture stories.
After studying first mechanical engineering and then art in DÃ¼sseldorf, Antwerp, and Munich he started drawing caricatures.
One of his first picture stories, "Max and Moritz" (published in 1865), was a huge success. "Max and Moritz" as well as many of his other picture stories were early examples of the what became the modern comic strip. The idea of "Max and Moritz", for instance, has been an inspiration for the Katzenjammer Kids.
Wilhelm Busch also wrote a number of poems in a style similar to his picture stories. Besides that he produced more than 1,000 oil paintings that weren't sold until after his death in 1908.</td><td>
