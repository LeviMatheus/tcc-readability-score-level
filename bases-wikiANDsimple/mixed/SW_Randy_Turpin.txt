Randolph Adolphus ('Randy') Turpin (June 7,1928 â€“ May 17, 1966) was an English boxer who was the middleweight champion of the world in 1951.
Turpin was born in Leamington Spa and became a professional boxer in 1946. In 1951, Sugar Ray Robinson traveled to England and gave Turpin an opportunity to fight for his middleweight championship. Turpin became only the second man to defeat Robinson when he won a fifteen-round decision.
Robinson and Turpin had a rematch in September 1951 where Robinson regained the title by a tenth-round knockout.
He stopped boxing in the mid-1960s. He died by suicide in 1966.
