Mount Rainier is a mountain 54 miles (87 kilometres) southeast of Seattle, Washington, in the United States. It is the highest mountain in the Cascade Range, at 14,411 feet (4,392 metres). The top of the mountain is mostly covered by snow and glaciers. Rainier is an active volcano, but hasn't had an eruption for more than 100 years.
On March 2, 1899, U.S. President William McKinley made the mountain and area around it Mount Rainier National Park; the country's fifth national park.
