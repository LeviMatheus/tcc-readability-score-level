Life cycle means how a living thing is born, grows up, gets older, reproduces and dies.
It can also be used to describe products such as software. In this case it means how the software is designed, written, tested and released.
Humans have two stages in the life cycle, child and adult. Other animals may have more stages. Animals that lay eggs have three, and most insects have four.
