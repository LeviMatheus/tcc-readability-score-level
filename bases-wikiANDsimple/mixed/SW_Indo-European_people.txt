Indo-Europeans are speakers of Indo-European languages.
Speakers of Indo-European languages in historical times and nowadays usually are not called Indo-Europeans but with the name of their language family like: Anatolians, Tocharians, Aryans (Iranians, Indo-Aryans), Greeks, Celts, Italic peoples, Germanic peoples, Baltic peoples, Slavic peoples, Armenians, Albanians (or subdivisions of these groups).
Note that in any case the term "Indo-European" means matters of language, which do not necessarily correlate with divisions of ethnicity or even of specific culture.
