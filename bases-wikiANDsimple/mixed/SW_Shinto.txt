Shinto (Japanese: 神道) or Shintoism is the native religion of Japan. They believe there are many "Kami", translated as gods or nature spirits. Some "kami" are just spirits of certain places, and some are the overall "kami" (like "Amaterasu", the Sun goddess). The word "Shinto" comes from the Japanese words "神", "shin" -- the word for god, and "道", "tō" -- the word for "the way" or "path". So, Shinto means "the way of the gods."
State Shinto was the main religion of Japan before World War II. Many Shinto customs are not done in Japan today, and some are still done every day, but they are not meant to be religious actions.
