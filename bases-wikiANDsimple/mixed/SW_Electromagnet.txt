Electromagnets are magnets that are only magnetic when there is a coil of wire with electricity running through it. This is called a solenoid. The strength of the magnet is proportional to the current flowing in the circuit. Electromagnets are used for a variety of purposes. In a simple example, an electromagnet can pick up pieces of metal, iron, and steel. The electricity running through the wire is called a current. The current is a flow of electrons, negatively charged particles.
Electromagnets can be made stronger by adding more coils to the copper wire, or adding an iron core through the coils (for example a nail). You can also increase the current.
British electrician William Sturgeon invented the electromagnet in 1825.
An electromagnet is very beneficial because it can be deactivated easily, whereas a permanent magnet cannot be deactivated and will continue to affect its immediate environment. Iron stops being an electromagnet very quickly, but steel takes time to wear off. To make an electromagnet, wind copper wire around a steel rod. Then connect the two ends of the wire to the + and - side of the battery.
Electromagnets are used in everyday items such as burglar alarms, electric relays and fire bells. Their ability to metamorphose from the state of non-magnetic to magnetic just by passing an electric current through it allows it to be used in many different items.
