Astrology is watching the movement and constellations of the stars and the planets, and trying to tell the future, or what a person's life will be like.
Someone who does astrology is called an astrologer or astrologist or less often, astrolog.
Astrology and astronomy started out as the same thing, but today they are very different. Astronomy looks at the stars for science, but astrology does it for religious, superstitious and esoteric reasons.
Most scientists think that astrology does not work, because there is no scientific evidence.
