Blood type or blood group is a medical term. It describes the type of blood a person has. This blood type is based on whether or not there are substances on the outside of red blood cells that can cause an allergic reaction when it comes into contact with certain other blood cells. These substances are called "antigenic substances" or also "antigens".
When a blood transfusion or an organ donation takes place, it is important to know what type of blood the donor (who gives blood) and the receiver (who needs blood) have, so that the receiver's blood does not have an allergic reaction to the donor's blood. This can be very dangerous for the receiver.
There are many different blood group systems. Of these systems, the ABO blood group system in combination with the Rhesus blood group system are the most important. In this system the presence or absence of the A-antigen, the B-antigen and the RhD-antigen are determined.
ABO System.
In a laboratory, blood is tested for antigens. When a certain antigen is found, there are also always particular antibodies found. These antibodies will attack any antigens that it does not recognise.
The blood is thus tagged as being "A positive", "O negative" for instance, where the letter refers to the ABO blood group and "positive" or "negative" refers to whether or not the RhD-antigen of the Rhesus blood group system was found.
Compatibility.
People with type O negative blood are often called universal donors because they can give blood to any other bloodgroup. People with type AB positive blood are called universal recipients because they can receive blood from any other bloodgroup.
Of course, before a transfusion takes place, the blood is also tested thoroughly for all sorts of other things that might cause problems for the receiver.
