The hallux, also called the big toe, is the toe innermost (closest to the middle of the body) of the foot. It is usually, but not always, the biggest toe in the body. In humans, the hallux is longer than the toes next to it; this is inherited. The disease Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva causes people to have a small hallux. In some birds, the hallux is pointed backwords to help with grabbing.
