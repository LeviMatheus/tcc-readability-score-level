File formats are also known as file types. A computer stores data in a computer file in the shape of a file format. For example: images are stored in a different shape than music files.
Also, most types of data (for example text, image or sound) have many varieties of file formats, all with their own special strengths and weaknesses.
There are, for example, more than five ways to store text as a file. Two of the most known ways are: the plain ".txt" format and the simplest of the "HTML" formats. The difference is that a.txt file can only store a sequence of characters but an HTML file can also store links to other files and the formatting of the text, for example whether the text is bold, underlined or italic (but usually HTML should say whether the text is very important, a link, or not very important; whether important text should be bold, italic or red is then specified using a file in a special format called CSS).
Often a file in a file which can store more information is bigger than a file in a format which can only store simple basic data. But the file in the more functional (complex, with can store more information) format can be more difficult to use with more simple programs, and a faster computer can be needed to use it.
File formats made for commercial proprietary software are sometimes a secret, so that people who don't work in the company which made the proprietary software cannot use their own and others' files in the format without buying their software. That action is called vendor lock-in, and can be used to make a monopoly. Because of that, it is sometimes a crime.
