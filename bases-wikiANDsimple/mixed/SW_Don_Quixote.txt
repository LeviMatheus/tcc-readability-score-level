"Don Quixote" is a novel by Miguel de Cervantes. The book, published in two parts (1605 and 1615) is considered to be the first modern novel. It is about Don Quixote, Man of La Mancha. Don Quixote believes himself to be a knight, and makes "heroic" rescues, including slaying windmills. It was first written in Spanish, and soon afterwards was translated to English by Thomas Shelton.
