Transition metals are a group of metals that are found in the middle of the periodic table. They all have similar properties.
When transition metals react with other chemical elements to form chemical compounds, they often have really bright colors. For example, compounds of iron are red or green, while those of copper are white or green.
Some of the transition metals are necessary to keep humans healthy, such as iron, zinc, and chromium. Other elements in the transition metals can be harmful to our body, like cadmium and mercury. Other elements like gold do not really harm or help us.
