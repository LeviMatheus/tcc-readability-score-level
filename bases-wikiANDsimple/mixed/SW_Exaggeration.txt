Exaggeration means the describing of something and making it more than it really is. The verb is to exaggerate.
An example of exaggeration would be: “I was walking along when suddenly this enormous dog came up to me. It was as big as an elephant”. The dog may have been big, but it was certainly not as big as that.
Overstatement is another word that means almost the same thing. The opposite of overstatement is understatement.
A hyperbole (IPA:[haı'pɝ.bə.li]) is a type of exaggeration that is used in literature. It is a figure of speech. The opposite of hyperbole is meiosis, which is an understatement.
In modern slang, the word “hype” is sometimes used about something that is getting more publicity than it really deserves. The word hype comes from the word “hyperbole”.
