Mount Chimborazo is a mountain and a dormant or inactive volcano in Ecuador. Its last eruption is thought to have been over a thousand years ago.
The top of Mount Chimborazo is the farthest away from the centre of the Earth it is possible to get on land. Although Mount Everest is higher, because the Earth bulges at the equator Chimborazo sticks out more.
