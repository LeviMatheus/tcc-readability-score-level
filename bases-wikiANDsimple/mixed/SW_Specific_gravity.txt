Specific Gravity (SG) is a special case of relative density.
It is defined as the ratio of the density of a given substance, to the density of water (H2O). Substances with a specific gravity greater than 1 are heavier than water, and those with a specific gravity of less than 1 are lighter than water.
formula_1
SG is by definition dimensionless and therefore not dependent on the system of units used (e.g. slugsft-3 or kgm-3), insofar as the units are consistent.
Based on the SG-value of a given substance, the density of that substance can be calculated.
