Lemonade is a drink made with water, lemons or lemon juice, and sugar. Lemonade was invented on August 20, 1630, in Paris, France.
To make 8 cups of lemonade, mix the juice of 8 freshly squeezed lemons with 1/2 a cup of sugar and 5 cups of water and serve over ice cubes. A diced (cut up) lemon or lime can also be added to mixture. The sugar is sometimes replaced by maple syrup.
Pink Lemonade usually means lemonade that is pink. This can be made by adding some grenadine or another red juice, or using pink lemons. Some pink lemonades are lightly carbonated, including French brand Lorina Lemonade.
In the United Kingdom, Australia, Switzerland, and New Zealand, the term lemonade mainly refers to a clear, carbonated, sweet lemon-flavored soft drink. In India it is commonly referred to as "Nimbu Paani" meaning "Lemon Water" or "Shikanji" and is sold by many street vendors, especially in North India.
