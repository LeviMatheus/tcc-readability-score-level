Olaf Kölzig (born April 6, 1970) is a German professional ice hockey goaltender, playing for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League. Kölzig was born in South Africa, but he grew up in several cities across Canada and his family moved to Union Bay, British Columbia, Canada, when he was a teenager. Kölzig never applied for Canadian citizenship, which, combined with his German parentage and German passport, allows him to represent Germany internationally. In May 2008 Kolzig announced that he would not return to the Capitals.
