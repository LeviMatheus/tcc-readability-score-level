84 Klio is a quite big and very dark Main belt asteroid. It was found by R. Luther on August 25, 1865 and named after Clio, the Muse of history in Greek mythology. The name Clio had previously been suggested by the finder of 12 Victoria, and that is the name B. A. Gould, editor of the prestigious Astronomical Journal, adopted for that asteroid, because of the controversy over the name Victoria.
An occultation by Klio over a dim star was seen on April 2, 1997.
