Miep Gies, n√©e Hermine Santrouschitz (born February 15, 1909), is one of the Dutch citizens who hid Anne Frank and her family from the Nazis during World War II. She found and kept Anne's diary after Anne Frank was found and sent away by the Nazis. Although Gies did not read the diary (as she gave it to Otto Frank straight away after recovering it from the annex and thought it would be rude to read), it has became very successful worldwide.
