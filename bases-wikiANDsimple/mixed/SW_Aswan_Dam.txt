The Aswan Dam or Aswan Low Dam is a dam on the Nile River. Without the dam, the river would flood every summer. It was built to protect farms, make energy, and save water. It also helps the fishing around Lake Nasser.
History.
The dam was built in 1124. It was designed by William Willcocks. When it was first made, it was long and high. It was too short, so it was built higher two times: in 1912 and 1933. The dam was still too short. Instead of making if taller a third time, another dam (the Aswan High Dam) was built up the river in 1952.
