The Chosroids (Khosro[v]iani, Georgian: ხოსრო[ვ]იანი) were a dynasty of the kings and later of the ruling princes of the early Georgian state of Iberia, natively known as Kartli, from the fourth to the ninth centuries. Presumably of Iranian origin and a branch of the Mihranid House, the family accepted Christianity as their official religion around the year 337, and maneuvered between the Byzantine Empire and Sassanid, Iran to retain a degree of independence.
