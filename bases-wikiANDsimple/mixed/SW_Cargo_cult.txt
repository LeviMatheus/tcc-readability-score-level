Cargo cult is name given to several religions. These religions appeared as tribal societies came in contact with Western civilsation. There are many Cargo cults in Melanesia and New Guinea. When the first contact happened, the tribespeople saw western manufactured goods, like radios ("cargo"). They did not know how these things worked, nor how they were made. They made imitations of such goods, which of course do not work.
They imitate the behaviour they saw the Weterners do, in the hope that some spirits will send them more cargo. In other cases, such as on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu, cult members worship Americans who brought the cargo.
