Wehbe was born in a rural town in South Lebanon and now lives in Beirut. She started her music career with her debut album "Huwa az-Zaman" (Arabic: هو الزمن "It is Time").
Before she became a singer, she was a model. She won title "Miss South Lebanon" when she was sixteen. In 1995, she was the runner-up for Miss Lebanon before the public found out she had a daughter named Zeinab.
Her second 2005 album was "Baddi 'Ayš" (Arabic: بدي عيش "I Want to Live"). The first song from the album was "Ya Hayat Albi."
