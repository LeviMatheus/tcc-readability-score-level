Hello is a word used as a greeting in English. It is used to welcome somebody. When people want to be less formal, they simply say "Hi". There are also many other ways of saying "Hello", e.g. a wave of the hand, a salute or a bow (both very formal), a handshake (some groups of friends may have a secret handshake) or a High five (very informal). Saying "Hello" is a sign of politeness, especially if it said in a friendly way and with a smile.
Hello is also used by many people when they are answering a phone call. Sometimes, people can say "Good morning" in the morning or noon, and "Good evening" in the evening. "Hello Mark" is an example of greeting with hello.
Some more versions of the word "hello" include; Hi, What's up?, Hallo, Hiya, Hey, Yo, G'day, Y'alright, 'Yello, how are you?, 'Alright?' and many more.
On Chat games, people greet others using the ones as above, but they also use things such as: Hai and YoYoYo.
The opposite of hello is Goodbye (said when people are leaving).
When visiting other countries it is very good to know how to say "Hello" in the language of the country, although many languages these days use the English word "Hello".
