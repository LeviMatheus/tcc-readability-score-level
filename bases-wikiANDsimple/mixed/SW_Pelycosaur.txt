Pelycosaur (meaning "basin lizards") were the earliest, and most primitive synapsids; they were not dinosaurs. These quadrupeds -- animals that walk on four feet -- appeared during the upper Carboniferous and went extinct during the Permian period (before the Triassic period when the dinosaurs evolved).
Characteristics.
Pelycosaur began as small, lizard-like animals and evolved into larger, more differentiated type. Some were carnivores, some were herbivores; some had sailbacks like Dimetrodon, some did not. The swamp dwellers had a sprawling gait and were likely ancestors of the therapsids, which led to the mammals.
