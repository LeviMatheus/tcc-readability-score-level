The Magic Tour was the biggest and final tour by the English rock band Queen with their lead singer Freddie Mercury. The next band's tour "Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour" began some 19 years later, after the death of Freddie Mercury and the retirement of John Deacon. The tour took in 26 dates around Europe's stadiums, in support of their latest album "A Kind of Magic".
In 1987, Mercury was diagnosed with HIV and the band together made the decision to cease touring, making the concert at Knebworth on August 9th the last time the four members of Queen would perform onstage together.
