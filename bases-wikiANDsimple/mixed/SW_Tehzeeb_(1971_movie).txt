Tehzeeb, is a Pakistani Urdu film, It was released on November 20, 1971.
The makers of this film have been asked to change the lyrics of a reference to Misr might prove detrimental to diplomatic relations with that country. While the line Laga hai misr ka bazaar dekho changed to Laga hai husn ka bazaar dekho in the movie soundtrack, the gramophone records, already sold in good numbers, are beyond redemption.
