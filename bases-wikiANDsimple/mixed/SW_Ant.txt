An ant is a small species of insect that lives under the ground in very large groups. Each group is called a "colony". One ant colony may have thousands of ants.
A colony has a female ant, called a "queen", who lays eggs.
Those eggs will hatch into worker ants.
Ants are usually small, but can carry the weight of twenty ants.
Usually, worker ants will carry food back to the colony so that the other ants and the queen can eat.
