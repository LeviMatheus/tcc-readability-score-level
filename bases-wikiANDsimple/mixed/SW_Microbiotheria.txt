Microbiotheria are small order of opossums containing only one living species known as colocolo or monito del monte.
At one time they were placed in the order Didelphimorphia along with the other opossums, but due to several morphological differences were placed in a separate order. The skull's shape is peculiar, with several technical differences from the opossums.
Colocolos are small and have a prehensile tail and a pouch. They can be found mainly in Chile and Argentina in South America.
