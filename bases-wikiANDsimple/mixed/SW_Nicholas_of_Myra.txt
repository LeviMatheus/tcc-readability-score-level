Nicholas of Myra, also known as Nicholas of Bari, is the common name of the Bishop of Myra. Myra is near Antalya, in modern-day Turkey. He was born between 270 and 286. He died December 6, 326, 345 or 351. He was born in the Greek colony of Patara, in Asia Minor.
In the 11th century, his remains were taken to Bari, Italy, to save them from Turkish (Muslim) invaders.
What he did.
His parents were relatively well-off. Nicholas is said to have distributed his fortune among the poor. This is relatively well documented. Less documented deeds of his include saving children from drowning, saving young girls from being made prostitutes (because their father did not have the money for dowry), helping seamen in a storm and saving a child that was abducted.
Veneration.
In the Eastern Orthodox Church, Saint Nicholas of Myra is a very prominent figure. Very often, the third large icon on the Iconostasis in Orthodox churches is devoted to him. The other two are usually devoted to Jesus, and to Maria with the child.
In modern times.
He is the Saint behind Santa Claus. He is the patron Saint of Children, of Seafarers and merchants. The Hanseatic League chose him as their patron saint.
