Height is the distance between the lowest end and highest end of an object.
For example, people consider the bottom of the foot a person's lowest end, and the top of the head a person's highest end. The distance between my lowest end--the bottom of my foot--and my highest end--the top of my head--measures out to 64 inches, so my height measures out to 64 inches too. "My height is 64 inches."
