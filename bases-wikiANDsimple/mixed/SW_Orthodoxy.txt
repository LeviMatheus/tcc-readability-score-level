The word "orthodoxy", from the Greek "ortho" ('right', 'correct') and "doxa" ('thought', 'teaching', 'glorification'), is typically used to refer to the correct worship or the correct theological and doctrinal of religion.
Up to the advent of Christianity the term was not used like that in the Greek-speaking world. Orthodoxy is opposed to "heterodoxy" ('other teaching'), "heresy" and "schism". People who profess a doctrine considered to be false by the majority are most often called heretics. People who separate themselves from the body of believers, i.e. from full communion, are called schismatics.
