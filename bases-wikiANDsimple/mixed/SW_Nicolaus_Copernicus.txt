Nicolaus Copernicus (Niklas Koppernigk, in Polish: "Mikołaj Kopernik", February 19, 1473 – May 24, 1543) was an astronomer. People know Copernicus for his ideas about the sun and the earth. His main idea was that our world is "heliocentric", from helios - sun. He wrote about his theory that the sun was in the middle of the solar system in his epochal book, "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" (On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres).
Copernicus was born in 1473 in the city of Thorn (Toruń), in Royal Prussia, a mainly German-speaking region that a few years earlier had become a part of the Kingdom of Poland. He was taught first in Cracow and then in Italy, where he graduated as lawyer of the church. He studied also medicine to serve his fellow clerics. Copernicus spent most of his life working and researching in Frauenburg (Frombork), Warmia, where he died in 1543.
Copernicus was one of the great polymaths of his age. He was a priest, mathematician, astronomer, doctor, jurist, physician, classical scholar, governor, administrator, diplomat, economist, and even lead soldiers. During all these jobs, he treated astronomy like a hobby. However, his formula of how the sun, rather than the earth, is at the center of the universe is thought to be one of the most important scientific hypotheses in history. Many people believe it was the beginning of modern astronomy.
