The First Amendment to the United States Constitution is a part of the United States Bill of Rights that protects freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, and right to petition. It also does not allow the government to establish a national religion. Because of this it gives everyone certain unalienable (cannot be taken away or violated) rights.
