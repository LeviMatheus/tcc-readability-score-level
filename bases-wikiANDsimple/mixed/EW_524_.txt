Year 524 (DXXIV) was a leap year starting on Monday (link will display the full calendar) on the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Iustinus and Opilio (or, less frequently, year 1277 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 524 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
