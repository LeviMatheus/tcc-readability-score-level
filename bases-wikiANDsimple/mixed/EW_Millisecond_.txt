A millisecond (from "milli-" and second; symbol: ms) is a thousandth (0.001 or 10−3 or 1/1000) of a second.
A unit of 10 milliseconds may be called a centisecond, and one of 100 milliseconds a decisecond, but these names are rarely used.
To help compare orders of magnitude of different times, this page lists times between 10−3 seconds and 100 seconds (1 millisecond and one second). "See also" times of other orders of magnitude.
Examples.
The Apollo Guidance Computer used metric units internally, with centiseconds used for time calculation and measurement.
