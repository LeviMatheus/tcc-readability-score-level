The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a cipher (a method for encrypting) selected by NBS as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1976 then widely used internationally. The algorithm was initially controversial with classified design elements, a relatively short key length, and suspicions about a National Security Agency (NSA) backdoor. DES consequently came under intensive academic analysis and studies which enhanced the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.
DES is now considered to be insecure for many applications because a brute force attack is possible (see EFF DES cracker). This is mainly due to its short 56-bit key length; in January, 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation worked together to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes. There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are impractical to mount in practice. As of 2008, the best analytical attack is linear cryptanalysis, which requires 243 known plaintexts and has a time complexity of 239â€“43 (Junod, 2001); under a chosen-plaintext assumption, the data complexity can be reduced by a factor of four (Knudsen and Mathiassen, 2000). The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are theoretical attacks.
In some documentation, a distinction is made between DES as a standard and DES the algorithm which is referred to as the DEA (the Data Encryption Algorithm). When spoken, "DES" is either spelled out () as an abbreviation or pronounced as a single syllable () acronym.
In recent years, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
