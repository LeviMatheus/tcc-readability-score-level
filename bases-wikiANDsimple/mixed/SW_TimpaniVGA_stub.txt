Timpani (sometimes called kettle drums) are drums made out of large bowls that are usually made of copper, over each of which is stretched a skin-like material, to make what is known as the "drumhead".
"Timpani" is an Italian word. It is the plural of the word "timpano". However, "timpano" is rarely used in informal English. More often, a timpano is referred to as a "drum", a "timpani", or simply a "timp". Someone who plays a timpani is called a "timpanist".
Timpani are different from other drums because each one makes a certain musical note when it is hit with a special drumstick called a "timpani mallet". Other drums that are used in orchestras and bands make a sound rather than a note, and are not tuned. A player normally sits with a group of two, three or four timpani around him, which is why the name timpani is in the plural.
