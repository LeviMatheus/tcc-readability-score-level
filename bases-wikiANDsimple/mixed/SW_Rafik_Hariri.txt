Rafik Baha ad-Din Hariri (November 1, 1944 – February 14, 2005), (in Arabic: رفيق بهاءالدين الحريري) was a billionaire and a businessman. He was also the Prime Minister of Lebanon from 1992 to 1998, and he became Prime Minister again in 2000. But in October 20, 2004, he quit his job. He helped a lot in rebuilding Beirut, which was damaged from the fightings during the civil war.
Hariri was killed on February 14, 2005. 1000 kg of TNT exploded near his car. His car was passing through the St. George Hotel in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. People are still trying to learn who did it, and it is done with help from the United Nations. Serge Brammertz is leading this investigation. Many people in Lebanon said that the government of Syria and its friends did it. So far, Brammertz said that a DNA evidence collected from the exploded area shows that the killing was done by a young man. It is believed that his man blew himself up at the time.
