Pangolins (or scaly anteaters) are mammals which live in Africa and Asia. They have scales on their skin. There are different types of pangolin. Some types live in trees. All pangolins eat ants and termites. They catch their food using their tongues. Pangolins curl up when they feel scared so that their soft belly is hidden from attack. In southern China and other countries people kill pangolins to eat them. Because of this, there are not many pangolins left in some places.
