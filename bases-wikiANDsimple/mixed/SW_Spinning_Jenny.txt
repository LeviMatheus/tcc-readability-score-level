The spinning jenny is a multi-spool spinning wheel. It was invented "circa" 1764 by James Hargreaves in Stanhill, near Blackburn, Lancashire in the northwest of England The device dramatically reduced the amount of work needed to produce yarn, with a single worker able to work eight or more spools at once.
The spinning jenny was a huge success due to the fact that it could hold more than one ball of yarn, therefore making more clothing materials in a shorter amount of time while reducing the overall cost.
