If Only You Were Lonely is the second album released by Hawthorne Heights. Many listeners consider the album more on the dark side, than the first Hawthorne Heights album.
The album includes a few songs where screaming is absent, and others where it is only used in a small part of the song, to make it fit better. Previously, they would just scream for the sake.
The band asked fans desperatly to mess up neyos (Pop music singer) album sales and to move copies so that people couldn't find them, but they would still be in stock showing on the computers. The main reason for that was because neyos album was being released on the same day, and hawthorne heights didn't think it was a fair competition.
It brought singles such as "This is Who We Are" and something new for the band with songs like "Decembers"
