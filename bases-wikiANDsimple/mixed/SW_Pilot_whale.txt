Pilot whales are two species of oceanic dolphins, which form the genus "Globicephala". The species are the Long-finned Pilot Whale and the Short-finned Pilot Whale.
The genus is part of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae) although their behaviour is closer to that of the larger whales. The two species are the Long-finned Pilot Whale and the Short-finned Pilot Whale. The two are not readily distinguished at sea and are typically just known simply as Pilot Whales or Calder√≥n in Spanish. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.
