A peer is a member of the nobility. It is sometimes used instead of "Lord". In formal old British documents, the House of Lords is called the House of Peers.
Ranks.
Informally Barons, Viscounts, Earls and Marquesses are called lords, and instead of their name when speaking to them, the term "my lord" is used. A Duke is never called a lord. "Your grace" is used for a Duke.
Exceptions.
The only exceptions are the royal dukes, and the Duke of Abercorn.
