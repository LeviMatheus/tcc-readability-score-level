The Flames won the President's Trophy as regular season champion in 1988 and 1989.
The Flames play in the Saddledome arena in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. It is called the "Saddledome" because the roof is shaped like a saddle.
Some of the top players to play for the Flames include Al MacInnis, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs in 1989; Jarome Iginla, who won the Art Ross Trophy as top point scorer in 2001-02, and the Richard Trophy as top goal scorer in 2001-02 and 2003-04; Lanny MacDonald, who scored 500 career goals, mostly on Calgary; Gary Suter, who won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 1985-86; goaltender Mike Vernon; and forwards Joe Mullen, Joe Nieuwendyk, and Theoren Fleury. Recently, the Flames have become a strong team because of goaltender Miikka Kiprusoff from Finland. Many people consider Kiprusoff to be the best goalie in the world.
