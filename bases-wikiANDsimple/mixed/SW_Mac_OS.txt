Released in 1984, the Macintosh Operating System or Mac OS is the operating system that allows a Macintosh computer to boot (start up) and operate. Historically, Mac OS was known as Macintosh System Software â€“ which in turn was often shortened to System or SSW (System Software). The term "Mac OS" first appeared in the splash screen for System 7.5.1, but wasn't officially adopted as the new name until the release of Mac OS 7.6.
The latest version of Mac OS is Mac OS X 10.5.5.
