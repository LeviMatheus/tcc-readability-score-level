Aristide Cavaillé-Coll (born Montpellier, 4 February 1811; died Paris, 13 October 1899) was a French organ builder. Most organists think of him as the greatest organ builder of the 19th century. He invented many new things and his organs changed the way that organ composers could write for the instrument. César Franck, in particular, was strongly influenced by the new type of organ that he was building.
Cavaillé-Coll grouped the stops of the organ into different families so that it was similar to the families of instruments in an orchestra. He made the lowest of the three manuals (keyboards) the most important one. It was called the “Great” (French: “Grande Orgue”). The other manuals could be “coupled” to the Great. He made changes to the English swell box and divided the windchests on which the pipes were resting. It made it possible to have louder reed stops because of the higher wind pressure.
