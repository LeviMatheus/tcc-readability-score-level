America's Next Top Model.

Cycle 7.
- Barker was offended by contestant CariDee English when she made a joke that he had stuck a stick inside his anus. English later apologized to Barker during judging, having written a letter that she read out. Barker forgave her but still made her enter the bottom two to teach her a lesson.
Cycle 9.
Barker is supportive of Saleisha Stowers, a contestant that eventually became the winner. There have been rumours on the forum of the show that Stowers slept with Barker so that he would put in good words for her in front of Tyra.
