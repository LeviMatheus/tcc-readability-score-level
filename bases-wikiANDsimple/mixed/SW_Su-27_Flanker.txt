The Su-27 Flanker is a Soviet fighter aircraft made by Sukhoi. It first flew in 1977, and was introduced in 1984. It was first made by the Soviet Union as a fighter, but now it is in the Russian Air Force. It can hold up to 10 missiles and a 30mm cannon with 150 bullets.
The Su-27 was made to pair with the MiG-29 Fulcrum, but in the Eritrean-Ethiopian War, Ethiopian Su-27s shot down 5 Eritrean MiG-29s. It was also supposed to fight American fighters like the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon. There are fighters similar to the Su-27, like the Su-33 Flanker-D and the Su-30 Flanker-C.
The Su-27 is still in service with the Russian Air Force and others.
