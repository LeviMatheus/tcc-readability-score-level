High of 75 is a single released by Relient k from their fourth album, mmhmm
it was played much on christian radio, and charted somewhere around #30
The singer of this song and the band named Matt thiessen said himself that the song was inspired by the weather in Ohio they couldn't depend on the changing of it.
It might be represented by the music, because sometimes it's urgent and fast then it goes slow and calm, reflecting the weather. Tempo changes were used in a similar way for the Sum 41 song We're all to blame
