Occam's razor (or Ockham's razor) is a principle from philosophy. It says that the simplest explanation is usually the best one.
"Entia non sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem'.'
"Things shouldn't be done more times than they need to be."
In other words, you don't need to think of a lot of other explanations for something when you already have a simple one.
Occam's razor often comes up in medicine when there are many explanations for symptoms and the simplest diagnosis usually is the correct one.
