The mandible is a bone found in vertebrates. The name comes from Latin "mandibula". This can be translated as "jawbone". Sometimes it is also called inferior maxillary bone. Together with the maxilla, it is the largest and strongest bone of the face. It forms the lower jaw and holds the lower teeth in place.
