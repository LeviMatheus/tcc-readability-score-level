The term Modern Times is used in history to describe the period of time immediately following the Early Modern Times. It means something else than the term "Modernity".
Modernity on the other hand, describes large-scale developments of "society" (including literature and philosophy). Modernism describes an art movement. Neither applies to political, social, or series of events since either the fin de si√®cle or World War I in a strict sense.
Events of Modern Times.
Some events show a new way of perceiving the world. The concept of modernity interprets the general meaning of these events and seeks explanations for major developments; Historians analyse the events taking place in Modern Times, ie. since the so-called "Middle Ages" (that take their name from being in the middle between Modern and Ancient Times).
