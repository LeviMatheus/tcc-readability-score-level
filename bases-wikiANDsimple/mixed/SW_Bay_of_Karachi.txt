The Port of Karachi (Urdu: بندر گاہ كراچى) is Pakistan's largest and busiest seaport. It handles about 60% of the nation's cargo (25 million tons per year). The port is located between the towns of Kiamari and Saddar. It is close to the center of old Karachi, the main business district, and several industrial areas. The geographic position of Karachi places the port near major shipping routes such as the Strait of Hormuz. The administration of the port is carried out by the Karachi Port Trust which was created in the nineteenth century.
