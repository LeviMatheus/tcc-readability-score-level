A terabyte (TB) is a unit of measurement in computers and similar electronic devices. Terabytes hold 1000 gigabytes (GB) or a trillion (1,000,000,000,000) bytes. Some people say that the exact number of bytes is 1,099,511,627,776. The term used for this exact figure is tebibyte.
Large organisations use terabytes of storage to hold massive amounts of data. People at home probably don't use terabytes, they would use gigabytes, megabytes and occasionally kilobytes. However, in the future terabytes of storage will probably be more common in home usage. In fact, according to on the Apple website, 2008 Apple iMac computers can be ordered with 1 TB hard drives.
