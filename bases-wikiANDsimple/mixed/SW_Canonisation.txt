Canonization means declaring someone to be a saint. This process is used by certain Christian churches and is possible only for deceased men or women. Before it must have been proofed that the person lived, and died in a way that justifies this decision. These persons then enter into the canon, or list, of saints.
It is incorrect to say that the Church "makes" someone a saint, as the canonization process does not make someone a saint, but only finds out that he was one.
