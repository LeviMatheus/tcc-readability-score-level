Sappho was an Ancient Greek lyrical poet. Some say she has been born in Eressos on the island of Lesbos, which is where the word lesbian comes from. She is said to be bisexual because her poetry was written to men and women. She was born between 630 and 612 BC. Her parents were aristocrats so she was rich enough to go to school. She later had a school where young aristocratic women received an education before marriage.
