HMS "Dunraven" was a Q-Ship of the Royal Navy during World War I.
On 8 August 1917, 130 miles southwest of Ushant in the Bay of Biscay, disguised as the collier "Boverton" and commanded by Gordon Campbell, VC, "Dunraven" spotted , commanded by "Oberleutnant zur See" Reinhold Saltzwedel. Saltzwedel believed the disguised ship was a merchant vessel. The U-boat submerged and closed with "Dunraven" before surfacing astern at 11:43 am and opening fire at long range. "Dunraven" made smoke and sent off a panic party (a small number of men who "abandon ship" during an attack to continue the impersonation of a merchant).
Shells began hitting "Dunraven", detonating her depth charges and setting her stern afire. Her crew remained hidden letting the fires burn. Then a 4-inch (102Â mm) gun and crew were blown away revealing "Dunraven"s identity as a warship, and "UC-71" submerged. A second "panic party" abandoned ship. "Dunraven" was hit by a torpedo. A third "panic party" went over the side, leaving only two guns manned. "UC-71" surfaced, shelled "Dunraven" and again submerged. Campbell replied with two torpedoes that missed, and around 3 pm, the undamaged U-boat left that area. Only one of "Dunraven"s crew was killed, but the Q-Ship was sinking.
The British destroyer picked up "Dunraven"s survivors and took her in tow for Plymouth, but "Dunraven" sank at 1:30 am early on 10 August 1917 to the north of Ushant.
In recognition, two Victoria Crosses were awarded, one to the ship's First Lieutenant, Lt. Charles George Bonner RNR, and the other, by ballot, to a gunlayer, Petty Officer Ernest Herbert Pitcher.
Captain Campbell later wrote:
Captain Campbell had been previously awarded the Victoria Cross, in February 1917, for the sinking of .
