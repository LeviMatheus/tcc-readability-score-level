A diaper (or nappy) is a piece of clothing worn by whose who cannot control their urine or feces.
Diapers can be made of cloth (usually cotton) that can be washed and used again, or diapers can be disposable (put in the garbage after they are used up). Disposable diapers are usually made of plastic or man-made (artificial) fibers and contain chemicals that are super-absorbent.
Diapers that can be washed must be folded in intricate ways (like origami) before being put on. But, with the disposable you must constantly buy new ones.
Viewed as unpleasant by some, Diapers are mostly used by children from birth until the child has been potty trained. The next most used age group is the Senior Citizen age group, however there are also adult diapers for people with medical problems.
In America, they are called this, but in the United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries it is called a nappy (short for napkin).
