"Saints" (1983) is a historical fiction book that was written by Orson Scott Card. Saints tells about the fictional character named Dinah Kirkham, from Manchester, England, who goes to the United States and becomes one of the multiple wives of Joseph Smith, who is founder of the Latter Day Saint movement.
"Saints" was originally named "Woman Of Destiny", even though Orson Scott Card was against this.
