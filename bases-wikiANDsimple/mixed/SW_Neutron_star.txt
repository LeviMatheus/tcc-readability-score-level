A neutron star formed from some supernovas of massive stars. Neutron stars are 30,000 to 70,000 times smaller than the Sun. Neutron stars rotate very fast; they can take anything from one seven-hundredth formula_1of a second to thirty (30) seconds. These stars are also very tightly packed; a teaspoon of neutron star would weigh as much as a skyscraper.
Another type of neutron star is called a pulsar. It also spins and gives of a beam of radiation, such as a lighthouse in space.
