Pubic hair is that which covers the area around the sex organs. It is generally darker in color and stronger in texture than other hair found on the human body. The main purposes of pubic hair are nature's way of providing protection to a delicate part of the body as well as to reduce natural odors from the sex organs.
Pubic hair appears during the growth spurt of puberty in girls as well as boys. Beginning as a few sparse hairs, the region quickly fills out in a triangular shape eventually forming a noticable bush of hair.
The growth of hair can grow upwards toward the navel, but will always continue to grow down past the pubic region and ending at the anus (the hole between the buttocks). In females hair will cover the outer lips of the vagina; in males hair will surround the base of the penis and lightly cover the scrotum (the outer sack containing the testicles (also called the "balls" or "nuts").
Some people may change the appearance of their pubic hair by trimming or shaping it, although a vast majority will continue to have a pronounced growth due to the relatively quick rate of hair growth in the area, as well as the desire to be seen as a mature adult.
Pubic hair is sometimes called a "bush," "nest," "pubes," or "curlies."
