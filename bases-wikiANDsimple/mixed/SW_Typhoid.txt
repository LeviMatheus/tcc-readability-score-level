Typhoid, also called typhoid fever, is an illness caued by the bacteria Salmonella Typhi. There are estimations, or guesses, of 400 cases a year in the United States, and 21 million cases around the world.
Typhoid causes a sustained, or steady, fever of at least 103-104 degrees F (39-40 degrees C). Also, it can cause stomach pains, headache, being delirious, and loss of appetite. In some cases, flat, pink colored spots appear on the patient's body.
It usually lasts maximum up to one month if it is not treated. However in the Indian Sub continent this is one of the most common disease due to poor sanitation and lack of basic hygiene.
