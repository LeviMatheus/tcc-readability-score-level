Red blood cells (also known as RBCs, red blood corpuscles or erythrocytes) are cells that make up blood. Red blood cells are very large in number; in women, there are 4.8 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. In men, there are 5.4 million red blood cells per microliter of blood. Red blood cells are red because they have haemoglobin in them.
Function.
The most important function of red blood cells is the carrying of oxygen. The haemoglobin absorbs oxygen in the lungs, travels through blood vessels and bring oxygen to all other cells via the heart. A fact which makes red blood cells different to all other cells is that red blood cells do not have a nucleus, since they need lots of room for haemoglobin. Since the blood cells go through both the lungs (to collect oxygen), through the heart (to be pumped around the rest of the body to give all cells oxygen) and back to the heart to be re-pumped to the lungs (to again collect oxygen), it is said that the blood in your body travels in a double circuit, going through your heart twice before it completes one full circulation of the body.
Red blood cells are doughnut shaped. However, hereditary diseases such as sickle cell anaemia can cause them to change shapes and stop blood flow in capillaries and veins.
