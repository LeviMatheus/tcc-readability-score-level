A waterspout is a funnel cloud over water. It is a nonsupercell tornado over water, and brings the water upward. Also, it is weaker than most of its land counterparts.
Non-tornadic.
Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm, are known as "nontornadic" or "fair-weather waterspouts", and are by far the most common type.
Fair-weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark, flat-bottomed, developing convective cumulus towers.
