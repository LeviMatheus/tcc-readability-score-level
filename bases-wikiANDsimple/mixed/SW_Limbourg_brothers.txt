The Limbourg brothers, or in Dutch "Gebroeders van Limburg" (Herman, Paul, and Johan; fl. 1385 – 1416), were famous Dutch Renaissance miniature painters from the city of Nijmegen. They were active in the early 15th century in France and Burgundy. They created what is certainly the best known late medieval illuminated manuscript, the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.
