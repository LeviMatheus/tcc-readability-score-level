Aelfweard (904 - 2 August 924) was briefly King of Wessex following the death of his father, Edward the Elder. The Kingdom of England was divided between Aelfweard and his half-brother, Athelstan, who became King of Mercia.
Aelfweard lived for only 16 days after his father and was probably not even crowned. Athelstan became King of Wessex in September, 924, so the English kingdom was re-united again.
