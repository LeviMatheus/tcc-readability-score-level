Pygmy marmosets are the smallest marmosets and one of the smallest of all primates. They inhabit Brazil, Ecuador, Peru and Colombia.
Description.
Pygmy marmosets have tawny agouti fur (the tip of the hair is a different colour to the base) with an indistinctly dark-ringed tail.
Habitat.
They live in flooded forest near rivers, bamboo thickets and the edges of agricultural fields.
Diet.
Pygmy marmosets mainly feed on gum (tree exudates, sap), but they also eat fruit, nectar and animal prey. They gouge holes in the bark of trees, and revisit these holes daily to collect the sap.
