Satellite cities are smaller cities that are next to a large city that is the center of a metropolitan area. They are different from suburbs, subdivisions and bedroom communities because they have their own governments and enough jobs to support their own people. Satellite cities could be separate cities outside of the larger metropolitan areas. However, working as part of a metropolis, a satellite city gets "cross-commuting" (people living in the city working outside of the city and people from other places working in the city).
