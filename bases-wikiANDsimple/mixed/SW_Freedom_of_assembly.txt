Freedom of assembly and freedom of association, is the right to join together with others to reach common goals and common opinions, both in public and in private. This usually includes business groups (or corporation), civic organizations, labor unions, political parties, and protest groups.
Restrictions.
Freedom of assembly does not mean that any group can come together for any purpose. Some governments prohibit militias, or groups of people outside the military that gather weapons and train soldiers, from demonstrating in public with their weapons.
