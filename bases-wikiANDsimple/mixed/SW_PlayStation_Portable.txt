PlayStation Portable is Sony's first video game console to be a handheld. It was made in Japan and came out there first on December 12, 2004. After that, it came out in North America on March 24, 2005 and came out in Europe on September 1, 2005.
It was first talked about in 2003 at E3 and then next year its first design was shown off. It can play PSP video games, as well as music, video, and pictures. To transfer music, videos, or pictures to a PSP, you must use a USB cable to send the files from a computer to it. The games and movies come on a disc called the "Universal Media Disc" which holds 1.8 GB (this is a lot more than a normal CD but less than a DVD). A Memory Stick Duo can also be used for memory storage. The PlayStation Portable is the first handheld game console to use a disc as its media storage instead of a cartridge
Games and movies.
There are many games out, over 200, but most of them are PlayStation 2 games made for the PSP, with less things. The movies look like the DVD, but they can cost more than a DVD. The reason the PSP can have movies is because the disk (Universal Media Disc) has a lot of space. For many countries Spider-Man 2 (the movie) was included for free but for some countries it will have to be ordered by signing up with Sony, because there were not many copies,but sometimes yes.
Wireless.
The PSP is wireless, meaning it can connect to the Internet (and other PlayStation Portable's) without any cables. This is called Wi-Fi. This allows players who are traveling to download items and play online. The PlayStation Portable can also connect with the PlayStation 3 as a sort of remote control for movie playback and for downloading content
Competiton.
The PlayStation Portable is similar to the Nintendo DS, because they are both for games you can take with you. However, Nintendo and Sony said they were made for different people. The DS has sold more units than the PSP.
