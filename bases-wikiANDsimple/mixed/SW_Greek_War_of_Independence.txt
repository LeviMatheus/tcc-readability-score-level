The Greek War of Independence (1821â€“1829), also commonly known as the Greek Revolution, was a successful war by the Greeks who won independence for Greece from the Ottoman Empire. After a long and bloody struggle, and with the aid of the United Kingdom, France and Russia, independence was finally granted by the Treaty of Constantinople in July 1832. The Greeks were thus the first of the Ottoman Empire's subject peoples who were accepted as an independent sovereign power.
