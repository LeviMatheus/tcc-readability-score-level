Eroticism is the quality of sexual excitement. In other words, if something is sexually exciting, then it is said to be "erotic". Eroticism is an "erotic" feeling. It is named after Eros, the Ancient Greek god of love
Many types of things can be part of "eroticism". Things that make a person feel erotic (sexually aroused or excited) include the sight, touch, smell, and sound of another person. A person may feel erotic when they see or touch or smell, or hear someone that they love in a sexual way. They may also have erotic feelings about a person that they do not love, but who is sexually attractive to them.
Sometimes "eroticism" has nothing to do with another person. A person might feel erotic from watching a movie, looking at pictures in a magazine, listening to a piece of music, reading a story or article, or just thinking their own thoughts, or being aware of their own body.
What makes eroticism?
Some things are designed and made especially to make people feel erotic. Things that are designed to make people feel erotic are called "erotica". This word is most often used for art, books and magazines.
Eroticism and pornography.
Most people believe there is a difference between "erotica" and "pornography", but some people have argued that all "erotica" is "pornographic". (In other words, some people believe that all pictures, movies or writing which are sexually exciting are rude and wrong, and shouldn't be made.)
People who have studied this subject say that erotica is not harmful to anyone, and may be helpful with people's loving relationships. Pornography is "not helfpul" in loving relationships because it usually shows a person who is being treated without respect or love.
