The hypotenuse is the side opposite the 90 degrees angle in a right triangle. It is always the longest side.
In this triangle, if angle C is 90 degrees, then the opposite side, "c", is the hypotenuse.
The length of the hypotenuse can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using Pythagoras' Theorem. In fact, the length of any side of a right triangle can be calculated if the other two sides are known, using this theorem.
