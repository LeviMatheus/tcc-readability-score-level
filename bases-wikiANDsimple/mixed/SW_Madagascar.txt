Madagascar is a large island nation in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa. Seventeen million people live there; its capital is Antananarivo.
Geologists say that about two million years ago, Madagascar was a part of the African continent, but it broke off and drifted to where it is now.
Madagascar is home to many species that were not known about until around 1679 when Dutch explorers went there. They do not even exist in Africa. They only exist in Madagascar.
The island shares its name with the title of a 2005 CGI movie from DreamWorks Pictures.
