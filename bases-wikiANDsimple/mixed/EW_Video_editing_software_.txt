Video editing software is software used performing the post-production video editing of digital video sequences on a non-linear editing system (NLE). It has replaced traditional flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analog video tape-to-tape online editing machines.
NLE software is typically based on a timeline interface where sections moving image video recordings, known as clips, are laid out in sequence and played back. The NLE offers a range of tools for trimming, splicing, cutting and arranging clips across the timeline. Once a project is complete, the NLE system can then be used to export to movies in a variety of formats in a context that may range from broadcast tape formats to compressed file formats for the Internet, DVD and mobile devices. As digital NLE systems have advanced their toolset, their role has expanded and most consumer and professional NLE systems alike now include a host of features for color manipulation, titling and visual effects, as well as tools for editing and mixing audio synchronized with the video image sequence.
