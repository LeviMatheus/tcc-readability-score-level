Skullhead was a 1980s Rock Against Communism band from Newcastle, England. Their type of music is a blend of rock, Oi!, and heavy metal music. The band and lead singer, Kev Turner (known to many by the tattoo's he sports, including "Doc martin" boots on the side of his face, which appear like sideburns) were also heavily influenced by the Odinist religion, to which many of their songs refer too.
