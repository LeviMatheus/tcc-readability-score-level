Louis Vierne (born Poitiers, 8 October 1870; died Paris, 2 June 1937) was a famous French organist and composer. He was blind from birth. He wrote a lot of organ music, including six large works called symphonies, "24 Fantasy Pieces" (which includes his famous "Carillon de Westminster"), and "24 Pieces In Free Style", which can be played on the organ or harmonium.
