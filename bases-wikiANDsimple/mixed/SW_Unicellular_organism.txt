Unicellular organisms are organisms that only have one cell. Unicellular organisms are normally from two classification kingdoms; Eubacteria and archaebacteria. Unicellular is normally either a eukaryote (a cell with a nucleus) or a prokaryote (a cell without one). They reproduce asexually and do not have specialized functions.
