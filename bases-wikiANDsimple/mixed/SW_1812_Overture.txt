Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the Festival Overture "The Year 1812" in E major, Op. 49 (French: "Ouverture solennelle "L'Année 1812"; Russian: "Торжественная увертюра 1812 года", "Toržestvennaja uvertjura 1812 goda") to remember Russia's 1812 defense against Napoleon's advancing Grande Armée at the Battle of Borodino, during the French invasion of Russia. The Overture was first presented to the public in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow on August 20, 1882 (NS; the OS date was 8 August). The overture is best known for its climactic volley of cannon fire and ringing chimes. While this piece has no historical connection with United States history, it is often used at Fourth of July celebrations.
