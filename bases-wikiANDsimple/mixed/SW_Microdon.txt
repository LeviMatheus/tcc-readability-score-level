Flies in the genus (group) "Microdon" are different from most other flies because they are myrmecophiles, which means they live in ant nests. There are more than 350 species (different kinds) of "Microdon" in the world. The most "Microdon" live in the tropics; 30 species live in North America (Thompson 1981).
What they look like.
"Microdon" adults are very hairy and look like bees. They are 8 to 15 mm long. The antennae are almost as long as the fly's face. These flies have black or pale (white or golden) hairs, and their bodies are either black or metallic green or blue.
The larvae of "Microdon" flies look strange. They are very round and look like stout little slugs. At first scientists thought they were mollusks and scale insects (Duffield 1981). They move slowly.
What they do.
Adult "Microdon" flies do not hover around flowers such as many other flies; instead they remain close to the ant colonies where they grew up.
Larvae may be found very deep in ant nests. Some "Microdon" larvae eat ant larvae (Duffield 1981); others are scavengers, which means they eat dead plants or insects in the ant colony. Most "Microdon" larvae can only live in the colony of one kind of ant.
Not much is known about "Microdon" flies because their larvae live in ant nests where it is difficult to see them.
