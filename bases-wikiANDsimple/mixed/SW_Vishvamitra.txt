Vishvamitra is the name of a rishi (sage) of ancient India. This is a Sanskrit word, and its translation is: universal friend, that is, a friend of everybody. Vishvamitra wrote many verses of the Vedas, especially the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda.
The Hindu scriptures have many stories about Vishvamitra. One of them tell about the competition between another rishi named Vashistha. Both wanted to become priests of big royal families of ancient India.
