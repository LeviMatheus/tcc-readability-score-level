James Charles Kopp (b. August 2, 1954) is an American criminal. He was found guilty in 2005 for shooting Dr. Barnett Slepian to death in 1988. Kopp said the reason he shot the doctor was because he was against the abortions that the doctor did.
Kopp waited outside Slepian's home with a rifle. He shot Slepian in the back through a window in his home. Slepian, his wife, and their four children had just come home from synagogue (Jewish church) when it happened. His wife and his son Andrew were standing in the room with him when he was shot.
