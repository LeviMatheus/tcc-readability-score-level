"GQ" (originally "Gentlemen's Quarterly") is a monthly men's magazine focusing upon fashion, style, and culture for men, through articles on food, movies, fitness, sex, music, travel, sports, technology, and books. It is generally thought of as being more sophisticated than magazines, such as "Maxim" or "FHM".
