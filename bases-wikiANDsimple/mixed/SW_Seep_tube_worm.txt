Seep tube worms (which are of the genus Lamellibrachia) are related to the giant tube worms. They live on the floor of the oceans, near cold seeps. There crude oil and methane come out of the ocean floor. The worm forms a symbiosis with cerain bacteria. These can oxidise sulfides. The worm binds the bacteria to a special hemoglobin molecule. It provides them with hydrogen sulfide and oxygen. In return, the bacteria feed the worm. The worms can grow to a length of about 3 metres.
