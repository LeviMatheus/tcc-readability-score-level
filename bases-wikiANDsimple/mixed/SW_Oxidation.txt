Oxidation is any chemical reaction that is the combination of a metal with a gas. The oxidation is a transfer of electrons from the metal to the gas.
When iron oxidizes with oxygen it is called rust.
Oxidation is the opposite of reduction. A reduction always comes together with an oxidation. Oxidation and reduction together are called redox.
