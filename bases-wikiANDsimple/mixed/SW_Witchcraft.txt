Witchcraft is the use of certain powers, said to be supernatural. A woman practising witchcraft is called a "witch", a man practicing it is usually called a wizard, (warlock meaning someone who misuses the "arts"), or a sorcerer. Very often, such people have a knowledge of the pharmaceutical effects of certain herbs or shrubs. They then use this knowledge to help people who are sick. In the Middle ages, witches used to do abortions, where the church would not allow a woman to abort a pregnancy.
In the early 20th century a system of beliefs, a creed has been developed. This creed is called Wicca.
