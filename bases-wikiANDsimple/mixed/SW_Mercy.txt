Mercy can refer both to a compassionate behavior on the part of those in power (e.g. "mercy" shown by a judge toward a convict) or on the part of a compassionate third party (e.g. a trip out of "mercy" trying to treat sick kids in Africa). The word is very common in several Religions (e.g. the mercy of God).
