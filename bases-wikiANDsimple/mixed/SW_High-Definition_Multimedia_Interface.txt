The High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) is a compact audio/video interface for transmitting uncompressed digital data. The primary use of an HDMI cable is to connect components such as a DVD Player to a High-Definition Television (HDTV). HDMI is the uncompressed, all-digital, global connectivity standard that delivers true [High-Definition] (HD) quality for consumer electronics and PC products via a single cable. It transmits digital video, multi-channel surround sound, and advanced control data through a single cable, replacing up to eleven older cables with a single connection.
