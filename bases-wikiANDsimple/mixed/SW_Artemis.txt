Birth.
In Greek mythology, Artemis is the daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. Leto had to find a place where the sun had never shone to give birth to the two. This was because of a curse set by Hera, Zeus' wife, because she was angry with Zeus. For this, Zeus raised an island that had been floating underwater and had not yet been touched by the sun. The island was Delos. Leto gave birth there, while grasping hold of a sacred palm-tree. Artemis was born first, and Apollo second.
