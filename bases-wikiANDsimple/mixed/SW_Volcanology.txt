In geology, volcanology (also spelled vulcanology) is the study of volcanoes, lava, magma, and other related geology. The term "volcanology" comes from the Latin word "vulcan", the Roman god of fire. Volcanology is a sub-field of geology.
A volcanologist is a person who studies volcanoes and their eruptions. Volcanologists visit volcanoes often, especially ones that are active, to look at volcanic eruptions, collect material from the eruptions, such as ash or pumice, rock and lava samples.
