Dian Fossey (January 16, 1932 â€“ December 26, 1985) was an American zoologist. She is most famous for studying gorillas in Rwanda, Africa.
Fossey studied the lives of mountain gorillas for many years. Some of the people who lived in the area did not like her because of her beliefs about how the gorillas should be treated. She did not want them in zoos or to be killed. Many people all over the world now think she is a hero for what she did to help gorillas. There is a movie that was made based on what she experienced in Africa. It is called "Gorilla in the Mist". Her book, also named "Gorillas in the Mist" is the best selling book on gorillas of all time.
She later was recognized for saving mountain gorillas and started the successful fund to help raise money for gorillas everywhere.
Her death.
Fossey was murdered in her cabin on December 26, 1985. Her head was cut by a panga, a local weapon used by poachers. Many people think poachers did this but there are other people who believe her murder was because of her beliefs against using the gorillas for tourism and financial gain. Fossey was buried at the site she created as a graveyard for the gorillas.
