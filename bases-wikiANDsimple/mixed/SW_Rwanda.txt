Rwanda is a country in Africa, located near Burundi, Congo-Kinshasa, Uganda, and Tanzania. The official language is Kinyarwanda. The country has three ethnic(though there is debate about whether or not these groups really are tribes): Bahutu, Batutsi and Batwa. It is now known mostly because it is the place where the most efficient genocide in history happened.
Colonialism.
During the Scramble for Africa, Belgium conquered Rwanda. The Belgians then began to divide Rwandans into groups: Bahutu, and Batutsi. The Belgians picked people that they thought looked more European to be abatutsi. The rest became abahutu. The Belgians told Rwandans that Batutsi were superior to Bahutu. They allowed Batutsi to rule over Bahutu.
Post-Independence.
In 1962, Rwanda became independent and Bahutu were given power. Thus, anti-Tutsi purges occurred frequently. Many abatutsi fled to Uganda, where they formed the Rwandan Patriotic Front, or RFP, which tried to invade Rwanda in 1990.
Genocide.
On the night of April 6 1994, dictator Juv√©nal Habyarimana's plane was shot down, but it is still not clear who did it. Within a half hour, roadblocks manned by the Interahamwe militia were seen all over the capital, Kigali. The Rwandan Genocide had begun. It would last for about 100 days, and it would leave over one million 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu dead. The main weapon used was the machete, or "umupanga". Other countries paid little attention to the killing. On July 2 1994, the RPF captured Kigali.
Tourism.
Rwanda has now put behind its genocide history and now concentration on building the economy through tourism and other means. Rwanda is famous for the mountain gorillas in Parc De Volcans. Tourism is one of the top foreign exchange earners in Rwanda. More information on,
