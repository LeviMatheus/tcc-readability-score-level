Things to do in and around Retie
There is a pretty town hall in the centre of the town, but unlike many Belgian towns it is not organised around a town squre (well it is now just a large intersection) and therefore does not have the quaint village feel as many other small towns in this part of Belgium (for example Lommel, Mol).
The main attraction of the town is Prinsenpark - a public forest that is popular with families and walking/jogging groups. Dogs on leads are allowed. There are picnic tables and toilets.
