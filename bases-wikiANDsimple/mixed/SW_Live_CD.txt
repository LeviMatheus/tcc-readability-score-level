A Live CD or LiveCD or CD Live Distro is a computer operating system that is executed upon boot, without installation to a hard disk drive. Typically, the LiveDistro is named after the bootable medium it is stored on, such as a CD-ROM or DVD (Live CD/DVD) or a USB flash drive (Live USB).
The term "live" comes from the fact that these "distros", or software distributions, each contain a complete, functioning and operational Operating System on the distribution medium. A LiveDistro does not change the Operating System or files already installed on the computer hard drive unless told to do so.
History.
The first Linux-based Live CD was Yggdrasil Linux (went out of production in 1995), but it did not function well due to the low throughput of then-current CD-ROM drives. The Debian-derived Linux distribution Knoppix was released in 2003, and was popular as both a rescue disk system and as a Linux Distribution. Since 2003, the popularity of Live CDs has increased, because of and remastersys which made it very easy to build customized live systems.
Uses.
Some LiveDistros are designed to "demo" or "test drive" a particular operating system (usually Linux or another free or open source operating system).
