Astrodon (meaning "star-tooth") was a long-necked plant-eating dinosaur, relacioned to Brachiosaurus, a sauropod that was about 30? feet (9 m) long. It lived during the early Cretaceous period, about 130 million to 120 million years ago. Astrodon is known only from fossilized teeth found in Maryland, USA (Astrodon is the state dinosaur of Maryland). Astrodon was named by Johnston in 1859. The type species is A. johnstoni. Astrodon may be the same as Pleurocoelus.
