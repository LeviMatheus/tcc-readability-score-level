A Bar is originally a long unbent (usually rounded) piece made of metal. It was originally made to spilt a room into two different parts (the one before, and the one behind the bar). Bars or handrails run through courtrooms in some countries. From there, there is the work barrister (who is a specialised lawyer). Lawyers in North America use the phrase "called to the bar" to refer to when a newly-graduated lawyer is admitted to the law society, which entitles them to practise law.
Businesses that serve alcohol.
Later, the meaning got extended, and also meant a long table where alcoholic drinks (such as beer, wine, or liquor) are served. It later came to mean the business where such drinks are served, such as a pub or nightclub. Bars such as pubs and nightclubs also serve snack food. In most countries, bars are regulated and licensed by the regional or local governments, which establish laws regarding the opening hours and serving policies. In Canada and the United States, a liquor tax is placed on the sales of alcoholic beverages.
