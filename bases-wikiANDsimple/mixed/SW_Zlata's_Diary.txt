"Zlata's Diary" was a diary made by Bosnian & Herzegovina's Zlata Filipovic. It was a period between 1991-1993 and her telling about her current life, mostly about the war that erupted in her vicinities of Sarajevo. Her entries were always, "Dear Mimmy" and she'd end with, "Your Zlata". She even wrote in her diary that her diary had been published, but re-published after she added facts succeeding facts about her diary publishing. She was called Bosnia & Herzegovina's Anne Frank.
