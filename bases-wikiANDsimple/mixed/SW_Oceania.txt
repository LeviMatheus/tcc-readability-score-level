Oceania is a name used in geography for the continent made up by Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and several other island nations in the surrounding area. Some people call this part of the world Australasia instead.
Sometimes, people use the name Oceania to include only the Polynesian and Melanesian islands in the Pacific Ocean, as separate from "Australasia".
