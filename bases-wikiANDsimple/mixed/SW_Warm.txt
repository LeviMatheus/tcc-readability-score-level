Warm is kind of temperature between hot and cold.
It is slightly closer to hot than it is to cold, although the distinction is largely arbitrary.
When objects get warm, more energy is stored in them. When an object is heated, its molecules move faster. Heat is always transmitted from a warmer object to a colder object; it is never transmitted in the oppoiste direction.
