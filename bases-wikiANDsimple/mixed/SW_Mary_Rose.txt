The Mary Rose was a ship which belonged to Henry VIII of England and was named after his sister Princess Mary. She sank in 1545 whilst in battle with a French fleet.
In 1979 the "Mary Rose Trust" was formed. In 1982 the "Mary Rose Trust" managed to get the "Mary Rose" out of the sea and in 1994 they started to preserve her.
The remains of the "Mary Rose" are currently in Portsmouth, England with the "HMS Victory" and "HMS Warrior".
