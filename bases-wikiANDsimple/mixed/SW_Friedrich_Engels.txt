Life.
Friedrich Engels was born in Germany in 1820. His father was a very rich factory owner, and sent Friendrich to England to run one of the factories. The way the workers were living at his father's factories made Engels upset with the class system. At about this time, he began to inscribe about politics and workers' struggles.
In 1854 he met Karl Marx in France and the two became friends and began to write together. The two men worked together until Marx's death in 1883.
After Marx died, Engels spent the rest of his life editing and translating Marx' writings. He also wrote about women and marriage.
