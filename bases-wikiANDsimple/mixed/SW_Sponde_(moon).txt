Sponde or, is a moon of Jupiter. It was found by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2001, and given the designation.
Sponde is about 2 kilometres in diameter, and orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 24,253,000 km in 771.604 days, at an inclination of 154° to the ecliptic (156° to Jupiter's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.443.
It was named in August 2003 after one of the Horae (Hours), which presided over the seventh hour (libations poured after lunch). The Hours, goddesses of the time of day but also of the seasons, were daughters of Zeus (Jupiter) and Themis.
It belongs to the Pasiphaë group, non-spherical retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22,800,000 and 24,100,000 km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°.
