James VI and I (19 June 1566 – 27 March 1625) was King of Scotland as James VI, and King of England and King of Ireland as James I. He was the first to call himself King of Great Britain. He ruled in Scotland as James VI from 24 July 1567 until his death. He ruled in England and Ireland from 24 March 1603 until his death. His rule was important because it was the first time England and Scotland had agreed to have the same monarch. He was the first monarch of England from the House of Stuart. The last English monarch had been Elizabeth I. She had died without any children so the English looked to Scotland for a monarch.
James fought with the Parliament and he did not use the kingdom’s money well. While James was ruling, the Scottish and English governments were quite stable. After James died his son Charles tried to rule in the same way as James, but caused the English Civil War. At the end of the war, in 1649, Charles was executed.
James was very educated and good at learning. He helped people in England to study things such as science, literature, and art. James wrote "Daemonologie" in 1597, "The True Law of Free Monarchies" in 1598, "Basilikon Doron" in 1599, and "A Counterblaste to Tobacco" in 1604.
