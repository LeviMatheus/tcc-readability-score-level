A solar eclipse happens when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun. It will then block the rays from the sun. This can only happen during a New Moon, and usually happens at least once every year. The solar eclipses are guaranteed to happen every 18 years, 11.3 days; a period known as the Saros.
