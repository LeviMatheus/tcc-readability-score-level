Horseradish is a coarse radish, to distinguish it from the edible Radish (Raphanus). Horseradish is taken from the root of "Armoracia rusticana". Horseradish is a spice which disturbs the nose more than the tongue, like wasabi and mustard. Horseradish is similar to wasabi, so in many places and restaurants, they use horseradish as wasabi, as it is much cheaper than wasabi, which is very expensive. The horseradish is white, so they have to color it with food coloring. People also sell horseradish on its own.
