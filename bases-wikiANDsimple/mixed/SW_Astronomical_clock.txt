An astronomical clock is a big clock in a building. It shows the time and date. It also has the positions of the sun and moon. It shows the zodiac, too. A few astronomical clocks also show planets and stars.
People made astronomical clocks in Europe in the Middle Ages.
Many astronomical clocks are on historical buildings in the centre of cities. Many astronomical clocks play songs at noon or every hour.
