258 Tyche is a fairly big Main belt asteroid. It is classified as an S-type. Tyche orbits very close to the Eunomia family of asteroids, and could be a member based on what it is made of. However, it is bigger than all family members apart from 15 Eunomia while lying at the very edge of the family group. Hence, there is a good chance that it is an unrelated asteroid.
There is some uncertainty on Tyche's rotation period. Many authors give values from 9.983 to 10.041 hours.
It was found by Robert Luther on May 4, 1886 in DÃ¼sseldorf and was named after Greek goddess Tyche. Tyche's Roman equivalent is Fortuna, who also has an asteroid named after her (19 Fortuna).
