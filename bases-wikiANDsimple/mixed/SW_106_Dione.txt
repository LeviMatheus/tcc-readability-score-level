106 Dione is a big main belt asteroid. It is probably made up of stuff similar to 1 Ceres. It was found by J. C. Watson on October 10, 1868 and named after Dione, a Titan in Greek mythology. Dione occulted a dim star on January 19, 1983. A diameter of 147 km was seen, closely matching the value acquired by the IRAS satellite.
One of Saturn's moons is also named Dione.
