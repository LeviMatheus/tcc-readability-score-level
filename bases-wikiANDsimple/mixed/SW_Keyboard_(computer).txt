"For other types of keyboards, please see Keyboard (disambiguation)."
A computer keyboard is an important device that allows a computer user to enter characters (e.g. letters and numbers) into a computer. It is the main input device for most computers.
There are different types of keyboards. The most popular type is the QWERTY design, which is based on typewriter keyboards. The QWERTY design was created such that the keys do not get jammed too easily, when it was a typewriter. Now there are no more typewriters but the design stayed as people got used to it. QWERTY is the first 6 letters on the keyboard. An ergonomic keyboard is designed to be easier for people to use, without straining themselves physically. The keyboard can not only input letters, numbers and punctuation, it can also serve as a way for you to control the computer, using special keys like the START button, and the arrow keys.
