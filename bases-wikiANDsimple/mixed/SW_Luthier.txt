The luthier is a person who repairs guitars, violins, cellos, double basses, and other wooden stringed instruments. These instruments need regular adjustments and minor repairs. As well, sometimes instruments are damaged in accidents, and a luthier has to use wood glue and clamps to repair the instrument. Some luthiers also build guitars, violins, cellos, double basses, or other wooden stringed instruments.
