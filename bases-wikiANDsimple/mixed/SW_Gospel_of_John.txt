The Gospel of John is a book of the Bible. It is one of the four "gospels" at the beginning of the New Testament. The four gospels tell the story of the life of Jesus. The "Gospel of John" is the fourth book of the New Testament, after the gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke.
In the gospel, it is says that the book was written by "the disciple whom Jesus loved". It is believed that John the Apostle, the son of Zebedee, wrote the gospel. He was probably the youngest of the Twelve apostles of Jesus. John lived a long life and was imprisoned on the Island of Patmos in his old age. He also wrote the last book of the New Testament, called the "Book of Revelation".
The Gospel of John tells many of the stories of Jesus' life that are in the other three gospels, but also contains a lot of different information. The Gospel begins by calling Jesus "the Word" (the Communication of God). It says "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God." In John's Gospel, the writer shows that Jesus was part of God, who came to live among humanity so that they could "hear His voice" and have the power to become true "children of God".
According to the gospel, the accounts are written so that the reader "may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in His name". (TNIV; John 20:31)
