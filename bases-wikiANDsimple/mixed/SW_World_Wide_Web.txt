The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new language called HTML. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in HTML.
The World Wide Web is not used to describe HTML webpages that are not part of the Internet.
In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a computer and a computer program called a web browser. Many websites nowadays offer free websites allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the WWW like any other domain (www.domain-name.com) site. These sites make money from advertisements instead of fees.
One thing about "WWW" is that it takes longer to say it out "double-you, double-you, double-you" than just simply saying "World Wide Web". It acts as a abbreviation only when you write it out. Some people just say "triple double-you".
