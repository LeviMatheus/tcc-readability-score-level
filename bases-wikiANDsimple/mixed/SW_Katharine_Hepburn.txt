Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907- June 29, 2003) was an American actress. She was on the list for 12 Academy Awards, and won four of them.
Hepburn was born in Hartford, Connecticut and went to Bryn Mawr College; she got her degree in 1928 and started on Broadway that same year in "Night Hostess".
In 1932 she got a role in the George Cukor film "A Bill of Divorcement", with John Barrymore. "Woman of the Year" was the first of nine films with Spencer Tracy. It began one of Hollywood's most famous romances, also on film in "Adam's Rib" and "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner". They were together until Tracy's death in 1967, but they never married. This was probably because Tracy, a Catholic, did not want to divorce his wife. Before they met, Hepburn married and divorced Ludlow Ogden Smith and was together with Leland Hayward and Howard Hughes for a long time.
Her autobiography, "Me: Stories of My Life", came out in 1991. She died on June 29, 2003 at 2:50 p.m., at Fenwick, the Hepburn family home, in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. She was 96.
