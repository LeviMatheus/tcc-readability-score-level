Tropical cyclogenesis is a meteorological word used to describe tropical cyclone formation, and its strengthening over the atmosphere. Tropical cyclogenesis happens when the development of a warm-core cyclone, is associated with a lot of convection in a favorable atmospheric environment. Usually, about 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm strength form worldwide every year, with 47 reaching hurricane/typhoon strength, and 20 becoming strong tropical cyclones (at least Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale).
