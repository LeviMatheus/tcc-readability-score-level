Year 235 (CCXXXV) was a common year starting on Thursday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar, the 235th Year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 235th year of the 1st millennium, the 35th year of the 3rd century, and the 6th year of the 230s decade. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Severus and Quintianus (or, less frequently, year 988 "Ab urbe condita"). The denomination 235 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.
