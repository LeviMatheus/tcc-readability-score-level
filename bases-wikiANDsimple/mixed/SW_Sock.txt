Socks are often worn on a person's foot. They absorb sweat and help to keep the foot dry. Socks also provide comfort to a person's foot and keep them warm in cold weather. They are usually made of cotton or wool. Socks can cover only the foot and ankle, or they may be long enough to cover the entire lower leg up to the knee. Toe socks are socks that wrap each toe separate from the others.
