Jain Dharma is the way of life and the followers are Jains. Jain Dharma is nature of substance and there cannot be any founder for nature. Bhaghavaan Rishab Dev revived the principles of Jain Dharma being the first of the 24 Tirthankars - World Teachers. In modern India, Jain community is a minority, but it is growing in the United States, Western Europe, Africa, and other countries.
Jain Dharma has influenced religion, ethics, politics, and economics in India for more than 2000 years. Jaina Dharma emphasizes the spiritual independence and equality of all life, and also non-violence. Self-control is a worldly expression and it is really chanalising one's capability i.e., 'knowing and seeing' - Gynaatha Dhrishta - on one's own Self - Soul, is how Jains attained the true nature of the soul - liberation -Nirvaan or Moksha. Followers of Jaina Dharma believe that there were twenty-four Tirthankars, or World Teachers who are all knowing - Omniscient - and shared their knowledge.
Jain Dharma lays emphasis on non-violence, truthfulness, vegetarianism, and the presence of a divine soul in every human.
Jain Dharma is nature of substance - "Vathu avo Dhammo" - and there cannot be any founder for nature. Bhaghavaan Rishab Dev revived the principles of Jain Dharma being the first of the 24 Thrithankars - World Teachers.
