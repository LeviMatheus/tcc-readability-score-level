A door is a hard, flat thing a person can open and close so the person can go into a room or other place. It is found in houses and other buildings. Doors are also found in cars and cages.
Types of doors.
A revolving door is a group of doors that turn in a circle as a person pushes one. The person can go through, but wind and rain cannot get in.
A blind door is a fake door that is really part of the wall. People use them to make a room look nice.
An up-and-over door is often used in garages. Instead of hinges, it rolls up on rails so that it stays above the opening.
A fire door is a door that does not let fire go through. They are usually made of heavy steel.
