Snell's law does even as law of refraction. In optical science, Snell's law is about the relationship between each refractive index of light that passes the guard of two materials which are contacted. When light with the isotropic medium advances different type of isotropic medium,the ratio of sines of the incidence angle and the reflection angle does not change if a medium is fixed.
n2/n1 = sinΘ1/sinΘ2 = v1/v2 n1,n2 is each refractive index. Θ1,Θ2 is an incidence angle and an reflection angle. v1, v2 is each velocity of different type of isotropic medium. The velocity of light is fixed in vacuum, and it comes to be slower whlie pasiing the specified substance. Index of refraction of vacuum is 1.0 and the velocity of light in vacuum is C. When the wave motion passes the material where the index of refraction is n, the velocity of wave motion becomes the 1.0/n * C.
The Snell's can be proved with principle of Fermat's principle. Fermat's principle is "The refraction occurs because light tends to advance with the direction that takes least time". We can understand Fermat's principle easy through the example when we run to the water from sands to save drawning person. In this case, Our speeds change the boundary of sands and water.
