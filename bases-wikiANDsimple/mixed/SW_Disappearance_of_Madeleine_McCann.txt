Madeleine McCann (born 13 May 2003 in Leicestershire, England) disappeared on the evening of Thursday, 3 May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve, Portugal. She was staying with her parents, brother and sister.
The disappearance resulted in much publicity across the world. Rumours that Madeleine has been taken to countries such as Morocco and Malta have all turned out to be untrue.
Madeleine's parents have started a website in their daughter's name where people can keep up to date on events and write to the family. They have also started "Madeleine's Fund" to which people can give money.
For most of the time Robert Murat has been an official suspect. On 8 September, Madeleine's mother Kate McCann and her father Gerry McCann were declared official suspects as well. They stopped being official suspects in August 2008.
