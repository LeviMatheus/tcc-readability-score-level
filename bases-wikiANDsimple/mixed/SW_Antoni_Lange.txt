Antoni Lange, whose pen-names were Antoni Wrzesień and Napierski (1861 or 1863 – March 17, 1929) was a Polish poet, polyglot (15 languages), translator and mystic philosopher of the Symbolism and Parnassianism movements, generally regarded as a "great master of reflective poetry". Although Lange was not a particularly famed author, many people call him "a magican of lyrical form" because of his unquestionable mastery in using rare poetic forms and innovations, which makes him a pioneer of modern "collage" and even imagism movement.
As a religious thinker Lange was one of the first to popularize Indian philosophy and literature in Poland; his existential reflection of "universal pain" (wszechcierpienie) unites Christian mysticism with traditions of Buddhism.
Lange was also an uncle of the poet Bolesław Leśmian.
Life.
He was born in 1861 or 1863 into a patriotic Jewish family who were heavily influenced by the messianic ideals of Romantic Polish poets, especially Adam Mickiewicz. What is important, in 1830 his father Henri Lange took part in the November Uprising.
"Lange’s own poems did not win him recognition, and the last phase of his life was poisoned by feelings of bitterness". He never married and had no children.
