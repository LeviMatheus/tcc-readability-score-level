Electrical engineers develop (think and make) different things that use electricity in a helping way. They fix or design a better way of using devices that use electricity.
History.
The first universities in the world taught philosophy and then science. With more learning they had to start teaching new parts of these sciences. When humans made industry, mathematics, physics and chemistry were mande, then mechanical engineering. When electricity was used more, they had to make a new part called electrical engineering. Big subjects in electrical engineering are power, automation and control, semiconductors, and information technology (high frequency and computer). These change in different countries. Software engineering has become a new branch.
