The Locus Awards were started in 1971 and are given to winners of "Locus Magazine's" yearly readers' poll. Currently, the Locus Awards are given at a yearly banquet. Unusually, the publishers of winning works are given a certificate.
The first Locus Award was given in 1971 for works published in 1970.
