Diaspora (Ancient Greek διασπορά, literally, "a scattering or sowing of seeds") is used (without capitals) to refer to any people or racial group forced or made to leave their traditional homelands, being scattered throughout other parts of the world, and their exiled community. It was first used capitalized to mean the scattering of Jews after the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians in 586 BC.
