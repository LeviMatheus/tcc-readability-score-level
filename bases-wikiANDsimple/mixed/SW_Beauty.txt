Beauty is a property of certain things. Something is beautiful if it is nice to look at it, hear it, feel it, taste it, smell it or think about it. The opposite of beautiful is ugly.
There are many other theories, and some things that people say are beautiful do not fit in to any of these ideas, for example sunsets.
