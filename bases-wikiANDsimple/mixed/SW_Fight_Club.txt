"Fight Club" is a 1996 book written by Chuck Palahniuk. It was later made into a movie that came out in 1999, starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter. The film was directed by David Fincher.
The story focuses on an unnamed character's path during a dark form of personal enlightenment (or eternal happinness) which is achieved primarily through fighting. The story is rather dark and, in both the book and the movie, contains strong depictions of violence. There are a large amount of metaphors which are revealed in its complex and twisted storyline. Some would think that the morals and life guidelines taught in the story would be an extreemist form of Buddhism ex. The concept of detachment from material possessions (things).
