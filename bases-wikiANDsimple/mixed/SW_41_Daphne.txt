41 Daphne is a big Main belt asteroid. This dark-surfaced body is probably made of primitive carbonaceous chondrites. It was found by H. Goldschmidt on May 22, 1856 and named after Daphne, the nymph in Greek mythology who was turned into a laurel tree. Daphne has been seen to occult stars three times (all in 1990s). Daphnes lightcurves suggest that the asteroid is non-spherical.
