S.H.E is a Taiwanese girl group with three people: Selina Ren, Hebe Tien, and Ella Chen. The group's name comes from the first letter of each person's name. A record label called HIM International Music created S.H.E after they organized a singing competition in 2000.
At first, there was supposed to be only one winner; that person was Selina Ren. But then the record label thought that the other two girls, Hebe Tien and Ella Chen, were good singers too, so they put the three girls together. Since the release of "Girls Dorm", S.H.E's first album, in 2001, the group has released a total of 11 albums, and sold over 4.5 million copies. However, some people do not like S.H.E because they often sing songs that other people had sung before. In addition to music, the trio has acted in many TV dramas, and sang many theme songs for them. Because of S.H.E's success, some Taiwanese companies are now trying to create girl groups of their own.
