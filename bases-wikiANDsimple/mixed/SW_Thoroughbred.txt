Thoroughbred is a type of horse. They are mainly used for racing.
Horses have been used for many years, for farm, racing to harness work. Horses were the fastest way for people to travel on land before cars were invented and the only way to travel long distances in a reasonable amount of time. Most horse breeds have been bred for a specific reason; the thoroughbred race horse was bred to run. Thoroughbreds originate from the Arabian breed, and all thoroughbreds can be traced back to three original sires (fathers): The Byerley Turk, The Darley Arabian, and The Godolphin Arabian.
Thoroughbreds are known around the world for their speed, but also for their jumping ability, which make them good for show jumping and other horse activities. Although thoroughbreds generally are slightly temperamental, they are very trainable and loyal.
Thoroughbreds are generally tall and sleek, with long legs to help carry them along the race track. Thoroughbreds can be many colours, such as bay (a colour which is brown with a black mane and tail), chestnut (red-brown), black and gray.
