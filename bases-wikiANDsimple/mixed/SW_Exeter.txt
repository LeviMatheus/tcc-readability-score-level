Exeter is a city in England. It is the county town of Devon. Its population is just over 100,000. In the city are Exeter Cathedral, a ruined castle and much of the old Roman City wall.
Exeter was built by the Romans, who called it "Isca Dumnoniorum". After the Romans left and the Anglo-Saxons moved in in the seventh century, the name changed to Exeter.
Later Exeter was a centre of resistance to the Norman conquest.
Today it is home to the Meteorological Office, which forecasts the country's weather.
