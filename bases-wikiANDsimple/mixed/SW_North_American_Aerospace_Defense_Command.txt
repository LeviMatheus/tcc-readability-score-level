North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) is a joint organization of Canada and the United States that provides aerospace warning and defense for North America. It was founded on May 12, 1958, as the North American Air Defense Command. Its main technical facility has been the Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center in Colorado, and for this reason NORAD is sometimes unofficially referred to as Cheyenne Mountain.
