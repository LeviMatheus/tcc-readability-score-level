The Golden Globe Awards are American awards for motion pictures and television programs, given out each year during a formal dinner. Run since 1944 by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the awards are a major part of the film industry's "awards season" which ends each year with the Oscars and Screen Actors Guild Awards. The broadcast of the Golden Globe Awards generally ranks as the third most-watched awards show each year, behind only the Oscars and Grammys. The Golden Globes has grown to one of the highest honors for actors and actresses.
The Golden Globes are awarded early in the year, based on votes from (as of 2005) 86 part-time journalists living in Hollywood and who work for media based outside of the United States.
