Tzitzernavank Monastery (, "Swallows Monastery") is an Armenian monastery located in the region of Kashatagh (under control of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic). The monastery dates from the IV-VI centuries and recognized as a native Armenian example of an “oriental” architectural type.
The church of St. Gregory was reopened after a restoration in 1999-2000.
