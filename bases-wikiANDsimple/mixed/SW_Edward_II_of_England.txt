Edward II (April 25 1284â€“1327) of Caernarfon, was King of England from 1307 until he was removed from the throne in January, 1327. His tendency to ignore his nobility, in favour of low-born favorites, led to political trouble and eventually to his removal from the throne. He is most remembered for a story about his alleged murder, which was linked to his reliance on the corrupt family of Hugh le Despenser, which has been seen by some as evidence of his homosexuality.
