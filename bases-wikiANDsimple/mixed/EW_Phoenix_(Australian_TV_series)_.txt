Phoenix is an Australian crime drama television series broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1992 to 1993. It was created by Alison Nisselle and Tony McDonald. 
The first series recounts the investigation of the bombing of the Victorian state police headquarters, loosely based on the real life Russell Street Bombing in 1986. It was followed by a second series, "Phoenix II", based on a series of violent aggravated burglaries ("ag burgs") against wealthy senior citizens.
The series was filmed in Melbourne, Victoria and was characterised by its dark, noir-ish visual tone and non-linear editing, reminiscent of the ABC crime dramas "Scales of Justice", "Blue Murder" and "Wildside", which all also dealt with corruption in the police force.
The show was lauded for its realistic depiction of police investigation techniques, aided by extensive research by the show's writers. It won several Logie Awards, including Most Outstanding Miniseries Logie in 1993 and 1994, as well as several Australian Film Institute Awards, and the Television or Film Theme of the Year Award at the APRA Music Awards of 1993.
The series spawned the 1994 spin-off "Janus", with Simon Westaway reprising his role as Sergeant Peter Faithful.
