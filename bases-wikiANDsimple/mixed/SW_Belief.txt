A belief is a firm thought that something is true.
It can be in thinking something will happen. For example "I believe amy will come around today" or it can be used in context of religion such as "I believe Jesus died for us all"
Belief sometimes goes together with Doubt but shouldn't be confused. Both feelings are not completely sure, but belief is stronger.
