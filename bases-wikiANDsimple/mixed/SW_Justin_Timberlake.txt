Timberlake was featured in the sixth and seventh seasons of the series. During the show, he met future girlfriend Britney Spears, future tourmate Christina Aguilera, and future bandmate JC Chasez.

Music career.
Justin Timberlake was one of the singers in the boy band *NSYNC. The group formed in 1995. The group released three albums, all of which were very popular in the United States and Europe.

In 2004, he performed at the Super Bowl XXXVIII (38) halftime show with Janet Jackson. At the end of the performance, he tore a part of Jackson's costume, revealing one of her breasts. This incident received many complaints from viewers. Many complained because many children watch the halftime show.

The phrase, which describes the accidental showing of a private body part, later became well known and is now often used in popular culture.
Due to the event at the Super Bowl, both Timberlake and Jackson were banned from attending the Grammy Awards in 2004. However, Timberlake won two Grammy Awards for the success of his first album.
