The CLAAS Jaguar is a silage harvester made by CLAAS. It has a DaimlerChrysler engine.
History.
The CLAAS Jaguar was first built in 1973, when the idea of silage was fairly new. Claas already made combines and balers. The first CLAAS Jaguar was a small green machine. The 10,000th Jaguar was sold in 1994, the 15,000th unveiled in 1998 and the 20,000th sold in 2004.
Success.
The CLAAS Jaguar is one of the best selling silage harvesters ever made. They sell especially well in European countries. Of the forage harvesters CLAAS sold in Ireland from 2000 to 2003, 60% were Claas Jaguars.
Model Range.
The model range has not changed much over the past eight years, except for 2003 and 2007. In Europe, the current models are the 830, 850, 870, 890 and the largest one: the 900. In North America, the models are 950, 960, 970 and 980.
Speedstar & Green Eye.
Before 2003, most forage harvesters operated at very slow speeds. In 2003, new technology meant that a new silage harvester, with the same look as the old model, would be built. In Autumn of that year, the CLAAS Jaguar Speedstar was first sold.
The "Green Eye" is a new addition. After four years of scientific experiments, the Green Eye was made in May 2007. The 900 model now being sold in Europe is known as the CLAAS Jaguar 900 Green Eye. The Green Eye is also available in the other models as well.
