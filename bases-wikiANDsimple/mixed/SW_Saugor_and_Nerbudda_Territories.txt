The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories was a region of British India. The territories were located in what is now the central part of present-day Madhya Pradesh state in India. It includes the districts of Sagar (Saugor), Damoh, Jabalpur, and Narsinghpur.
The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were captured from the Marathas after the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1818. Saugor was the seat of a Maratha governor, and the northern part of the territory was given to the British by the Maratha Peshwa, the southern part, which included Jabalpur and the upper Narmada River valley, was ceded by the Bhonsle Maharaja of Nagpur. The Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were attached to the North-Western Provinces, which included the British Dominions in the southern part of present-day Uttar Pradesh state. In 1861 the Saugor and Nerbudda Territories were combined with Nagpur Province, which the British had taken over in 1853, to form the Central Provinces.
