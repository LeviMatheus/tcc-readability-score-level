Cognitive psychology is a branch of psychology that looks into internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language. The school of thought arising from this approach is known as cognitivism. It had its beginnings in the Gestalt psychology of Max Wertheimer, Wolfgang KÃ¶hler, and Kurt Koffka, and in the work of Jean Piaget, who provided a theory of stages or phases that describe children's cognitive development. Cognitive psychologists are interested in how people understand, diagnose, and solve problems, concerning themselves with the mental processes between stimulus and response.
