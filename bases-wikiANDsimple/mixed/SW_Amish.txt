The Amish, also known as Pennsylvania Dutch, are a group of people who prefer simple lifestyles. They are usually farmers, and they do not use electricity or automobiles. The ancestors of the Amish came from Germany in the 18th century, and now most of the Amish live in Pennsylvania (Lancaster County) and Ohio, in the United States. They are related to the Mennonites. They speak an old dialect of German, known as Pennsylvania German.
Generally, they are friendly people in that they will wave to someone passing by. However, it is against their religion to pose for photographs. Often they will turn their head down and to the side if someone aims a camera in their direction.
Married men are not allowed to shave their beards, but they are also not allowed to have mustaches. Only unmarried men shave their faces.
Amish characters are in the movie Witness, starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis.
