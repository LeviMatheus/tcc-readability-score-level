Venezuela is a country in northern South America. Its official name is República Bolivariana de Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela). The official language is Spanish, and its capital is Caracas. Venezuela produces a large amount of oil every year, and has one of the largest oil supplies in the world.
Venezuela has a racial mix in its inhabitants, and that came from the colonial period. When whites (British, Spaniards, French...) conquers America's territory, they take their black africans slaves to America to work. In Venezuela's colonial times, black people have not any right, they just work for food; Indigenous was instructed in Roman Catholic Religion; at the beginning, the Church said that Amerindians aren't people, but later, the Pope thought that Amerindians was people, but like under age. To this way, white creoles, (who was descendants of Spaniards, was white Venezuelan people and they considered Venezuela as their land, and they don't wanted to Spaniards gobern in their country) headed society. That was one of the reasons which drived the pro-independence thinking.
Ancient Venezuelans came from the east, west, south, and north. Christopher Columbus was the first European to step on the land, but there were already natives living there for a long time. The Spaniards first conquered Venezuela. Slaves were imported from Africa. Venezuela's economy is based on oil, cotton, cocoa, sugar, coffee, and tobacco. On July 24, 1823, Venezuela won its independence led by Simon Bolivar.
