Until 308 BC, Carthage was ruled, at least officially, by Monarchs.
Monarchs of Carthage, 814 BC-308 BC
In 480 BC, following Hamilcar I's death, the King lost most of his power to an aristocratic Council of Elders. In 308 BC, Bomilcar attempted a coup (rebellion) to restore the monarch to full power, but failed, which led to Carthage becoming in name as well as in fact a republic.
