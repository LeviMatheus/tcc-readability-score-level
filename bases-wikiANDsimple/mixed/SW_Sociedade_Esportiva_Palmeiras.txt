Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, usually called Palmeiras, is a Brazilian football team. They are from São Paulo, Brazil. The team was founded by an Italian-speaking community on August 26, 1914, as Palestra Itália. They changed to the name used now on September 14, 1942.
They play in green shirts, white shorts and green socks and are one of the most popular and traditional Brazilian clubs.
Palmeiras plays at the Palestra Itália stadium, which has seats for 35,000, but local derbies against São Paulo or Corinthians, however, are usually played in Morumbi stadium, which has a much greater capacity of 80,000 people.
