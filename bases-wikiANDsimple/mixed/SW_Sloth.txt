Sloths are mammals that live in Central and South America. They are part of the order Pilosa. There are two species of sloths: two-toed and three-toed. Most scientists call these two families the Folivora, while some call it Phyllophaga.
Most sloths are about the size of a small dog and they have short, flat flat heads. Their hair is grayish brown but, at times they look grey-green in color because they move so slowly that tiny camouflaging algae grow all over their coats.
Sloths are active at night and sleep curled up with their head placed between the arms and the feet drawn close together. This disguises them as part of a tree so that its enemies like the jaguar do not see them. Sloths rarely climb down from the trees and can live for up to 30 years.
