The vulva is a body part of female mammals (and of women). It describes the part of the female genitals that are visible from the outside. The main, normally visible portions of the vulva consist of two sets of fleshy "lips", known as labia. The labia majora are on the outside,and provide protection to the internal genital structures in the form of padding. The inner lips are the labia minora, they are connected to the hood of the Clitoris and, function as both a covering for the actual vagina, or "birth canal", and to assist in the lubrication of the penis during sexual intercourse. What many people call the vagina is simply the vulva. The term vagina refers to the "tube" connecting the internal parts (the womb) to the vulva.
