Menilite is a greyish-brown form of the mineraloid opal. It is also known as "liver opal" or "leberopal" (German), due to its color. It is called menilite because it was first described from MÃ©nilmontant (Paris), France, where it occurs as concretions within bituminous Early Oligocene Menilite Shales.
