Leila Alice Daughtry Denmark, M.D. (born February 1, 1898) is an American pediatrician who still worked until she was 103. She worked on the vaccine for pertussis (also known as whooping cough) in the 1920s and 1930s.
As a doctor, she was one of the first to be against smoking near children and drug use in pregnant women. She also thinks that it is bad to drink cow's milk, people should eat fruit but not drink fruit juices, and drink only water.
When she turned 100, she did not want cake because it had too much sugar in it. She turned 110 in 2008, becoming a rare case of a supercentenarian who had been well known for reasons other than her age.
