Mercenaries are soldiers who fight mainly for money, rather than for their country or for their political beliefs.
For many years in the Middle Ages soldiers from Switzerland fought battles for which ever side paid them. The popes would hire soldiers from Switzerland to fight for them. The Swiss Guard is all that is left of Switzerland's mercenary tradition. However the modern Swiss Guard are not mercenaries, because the guards are all catholic and are prepared to fight not for their country but for their beliefs.
In 2004, Sir Mark Thatcher was arrested in connection with an attempt by mercenaries to take over the country of Equatorial Guinea. Thatcher, son of Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He was eventually fined because of his involvement in giving funds to the leaders, but not with planning the fighting.
