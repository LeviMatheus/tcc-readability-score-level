Technical terminology is the specialized vocabulary of a field. These terms have specific definitions within the field, which is not necessarily the same as their meaning in common use. Jargon is similar, but more informal in definition and use, while legal terms of art or words of art have meanings that are strictly defined by law.
An industry term is a type of technical terminology that has a particular meaning within a specific industry. The phrase industry term implies that a word or phrase is a typical one within a particular industry or business and people within the industry or business will be familiar with and use the term.
The term "jargon" can, and often does, have pejorative (negative) connotations, particularly when aimed at "business culture". The marketing and public relations industries in particular have expanded the vocabulary of jargon that marks the global business environment.
