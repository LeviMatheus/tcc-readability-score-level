44 Nysa is a quite big and very bright main belt asteroid. It is also the brightest member of the Nysa asteroid family. It is classified as a rare class E asteroid and is probably the biggest of this type (though 55 Pandora is only a bit smaller).
It was found by H. Goldschmidt on May 27, 1857 and named after the mythical land of Nysa in Greek mythology.
The shape model constructed from the lightcurve of Nysa is shaped like a cone, indicating that the asteroid may actually be a contact binary.
Nysa has so far been reported occulting a star twice.
