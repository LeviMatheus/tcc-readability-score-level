A domestic pig (or hog'") is a farm animal. Pigs are usually eaten for food called pork and often made into bacon.
They are often pink, but small pigs kept as pets ("pot-bellied pigs") are often other colors. Pigs often roll in mud to protect themselves from sunlight. Many people think that pigs are dirty and smell. But in fact, they roll around in the mud to keep parasitic animals away from their skin. This also helps to keep their skin moist and lower their body temperature on hot days. Pigs
Some Jewish, Muslim and some Christian religions may believe that eating pork is wrong because they think pigs are dirty animals.
