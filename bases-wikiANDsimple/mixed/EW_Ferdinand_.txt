Ferdinand is a Germanic name composed of the elements "frith" "protection", "frið" "peace" (PIE "pri" to love, to make peace) or alternatively "farð" "journey, travel", Proto-Germanic *farthi, abstract noun from root *far- "to fare, travel" (PIE "par" "to lead, pass over"), and "courage" or "nand" "ready, prepared" related to Old High German "nendan" "to risk, venture."
The name was adopted in Romance languages from its use in the Visigothic Kingdom. It is reconstructed as either Gothic "Ferdinanths" or "Frithunanths".
It became popular in German-speaking Europe only from the 16th century, with Habsburg rule over Spain.
Variants of the name include "Fernán", "Fernando", "Hernando", and "Hernán" in Spanish, "Ferran" in Catalan, and "Fernando" and "Fernão" in Portuguese. 
The French forms are "Ferrand", "Fernand", and "Fernandel", and it is "Ferdinando" and "Fernando" in Italian. In Hungarian both "Ferdinánd" and "Nándor" are used equally.
There are numerous short forms in many languages, such as the Finnish Veeti.
There is a feminine Spanish, Portuguese and Italian form, "Fernanda".
