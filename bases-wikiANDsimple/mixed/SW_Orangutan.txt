Orangutans ("Pongo") are great apes that have fur with a color between red and brown. There are two species of orangutan. They are from Southeast Asia. There are very few of them left, because loss of the jungle has made many of them die. There are famous orang utans on show at the Singapore Zoo.
The name Orangutan comes from "orang hutan", which means "man of the forest" in Indonesia
Appearance.
Orangutans have red-brown fur. They have very long and strong arms. They also have hands that are good for climbing.
The "Sumatran Orangutan" is smaller and has longer hair/fur than the "Bornean Orangutan". Orangutans have been driven into different habitats because of forest depletion and are on the very edge of extinction.
Life.
Orangutans are from the rainforests on the islands Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. They mostly live up in the trees. They eat fruit, leaves and bark, but also insects, bird eggs and small vertebrate animals.
After a pregnancy of 230-260 days the female gives birth to usually one baby, but sometimes two.
