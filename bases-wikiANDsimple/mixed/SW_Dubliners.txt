"Dubliners" is a collection of 15 short stories by James Joyce, an Irish writer. It was his first book and was first published in 1914.
The fifteen stories were supposed to describe very well the life of Irish people living in and around Dublin in the early years of the 20th century.
The stories in the collection are first told by children, and as the stories continue they deal with the lives of older people. The last story, "The Dead", is the longest and the most famous.
