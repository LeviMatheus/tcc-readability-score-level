The 2009 Atlantic hurricane season will be the period of 2009 when tropical cyclones will likely form in the Atlantic Ocean. The season will officially start on June 1 and end on November 30. Sometimes tropical or subtropical cyclones form outside of these dates. If that would happen, it would count as part of the 2009 season.
Seasonal forecasts.
Forecasts of hurricane activity are issued before each hurricane season by hurricane experts Dr. Philip J. Klotzbach, Dr. William M. Gray. They are also issued separately by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasters. On December 10, 2008, Klotzbach's team said there would be above-average activity in 2009, with 14 named storms and 7 hurricanes.
