Chris Moyles is the presenter of a breakfast radio show on BBC Radio 1. He was born on February 22, 1974 in Leeds. His career in radio started when he was 14, when he worked on a hospital radio. He worled at lots of different stations until in 1997 he got a job at BBC Radio 1. When he took over the Breakfast show from fellow DJ Sara Cox he quickly brought more listeners to the show and won awards for his show. He is sometimes called 'The Saviour' of Radio 1 because of this.
Apart from the radio, Moyles has also made a few television appearances, with differing amounts of success. He also has written an autobiography called "The Gospel According to Chris Moyles: The Story of One Man and his Mouth".
