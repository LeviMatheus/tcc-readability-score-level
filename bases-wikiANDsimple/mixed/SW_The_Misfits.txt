The Misfits were a punk rock band from New Jersey, usually classified as a hardcore punk or horror punk band. They often played in theatrical makeup to look spooky and had themes mostly from old movies, especially horror movies. The lead singer was Glenn Danzig, who later formed Samhain and then Danzig (band). Other members went on to form a new version of the Misfits in the late 90's which eventually also contained members of the Ramones and Black Flag.
The Misfits had many of their records released in limited collectible versions sometimes through their fan club called The Fiend Club, and have had a huge influence on everything from the way punk is marketed (the Misfits rival Kiss in marketing of their skull logo) to the numerous celebrities wearing their t shirts.
