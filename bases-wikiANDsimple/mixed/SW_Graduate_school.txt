A graduate school (or grad school) is a school that gives advanced academic degrees, such as doctoral degrees with the usual requirement that students must have an undergraduate (bachelor's) degree. Many universities give graduate degrees; a graduate school is not always a separate school. Graduate students are students that go to the school.
