A monk is a man who decides to obey a set of very strict laws or rules.
They usually do this because they believe in a religion. Monks think that by obeying these laws that they can live a very religious life. If monks obey the laws until they die, they believe that they can have a happy afterlife or make God happy, or both.
Some monks live on their own (these are sometimes called Hermits), while others live with other monks in monasteries.
Women who live like monks are usually called nuns. If a woman is called a nun and lives with other nuns then the place where she lives is usually called a convent.
