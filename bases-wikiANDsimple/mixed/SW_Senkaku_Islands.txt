The Senkaku Islands or Diaoyu Islands (Chinese language: 釣魚台列嶼 and Japanese language 尖閣諸島) are also known as Pinnacle Islands. They are claimed by China and Japan. The Republic of China based in Taiwan claimed them for the first time on 11 June 1971, which was followed by the People's Republic of China based in Mainland China on 30 December.
The islands are currently under Japan's control. The islands are very small. There is no population. But the surrounding area is rich with natural resources, such as fish and natural gas.
