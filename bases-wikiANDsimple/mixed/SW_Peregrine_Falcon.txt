The Peregrine Falcon ("Falco peregrinus") is a cosmopolitan bird of prey in the family Falconidae. It can also be known just as the Peregrine, and was once called the "Duck Hawk" in North America.
It is a large, crow-sized falcon, with a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head and "moustache". It can fly at up to 322 h (200 mph), which means it is the fastest animal in the world. As with other bird-eating raptors, the female is bigger than the male. There are 17â€“19 subspecies recorded, and each varies slightly in appearance and where they live. There is disagreement over whether the distinctive Barbary Falcon is a subspecies or the Peregrine or just a different species.
