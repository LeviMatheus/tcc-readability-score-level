James Warren "Jim" Jones (May 13, 1931 â€“ November 18, 1978) was an American preacher and religious leader. His church was called the "People's Temple". It began as a Christian church (a member church of the Disciples of Christ), but over time became a cult. Jones and most of the members of his group committed suicide on November 18, 1978 in Guyana.
