Father Damien, also Blessed Damien of Molokai, born as Joseph de Veuster in Belgium on January 3, 1840 and died on April 15, 1889, was a Roman Catholic Priest and missionary. He was known for helping people with leprosy in the colony of Kalaupapa on the island of Molokai in Hawaii. Father Damien came to Hawaii in 1864. During this time, many Native Hawaiians were dying from many of the diseases they caught from the white settlers. The King of Hawaii, made the people who had leprosy live in a colony away from other people. Father Damien went to help the sick people and gave them hope. Father Damien also died from leprosy, but what he did helped many people. In 1995, he was beatified (made an important person) by the Pope, and he is recognized by both the Catholic and Anglican churches. His patronages include, not only leprosy, outcasts, and Hawaii, but people suffering from HIV and AIDS as well.
