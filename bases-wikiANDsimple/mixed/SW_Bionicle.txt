BIONICLE is a popular line of toys produced by the Lego Company in 2001. The line features half-living, half-robot beings in a different world, where there are heroes and villains.
The main heroes are called "Toa", and the main villains are called "Makuta". Makuta have many dark servants (Rahkshi, Piraka, Visorak and Barraki) that fight the Toa in their quest to bring peace and order to their shattered universe.
There are different types of Toa, such as the Toa Nuva, the Toa Metru the Toa Hagah, and the Toa Mahri. Each character has one main color. For example, some characters are mostly red, others are mostly blue.
