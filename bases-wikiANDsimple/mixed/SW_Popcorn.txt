Popcorn is a snack food. Popcorn seeds are exploded by heating. The small amount of water inside the seeds causes pressure inside the seeds when hot. This pressure breaks the seeds open, and the meat inside the seeds expands. When the seed shell breaks a sharp noise is made. The name "pop" is because of this noise. The expanded seed meat is a white, low density material.
Salt and hot butter is usually added to popcorn. Sometimes candy is melted and mixed into the popcorn.
