Phototrophs "(photo=light, troph=nourishment)" or photoautotrophs "(photo=light, auto=self, troph=nourishment)" are organisms which carry out photosynthesis.
With the help of energy from sunlight carbon dioxide and water are converted into organic materials that can be used in cellular functions. Such a function can be for example respiration.
