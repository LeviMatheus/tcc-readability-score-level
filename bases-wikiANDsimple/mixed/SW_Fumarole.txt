A fumarole (Latin "fumus", smoke) is an opening in the crust of the Earth, often in the neighborhood of volcanoes, where steam and gases come out, for instance carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen sulfide.
The name solfatara (from the Italian "solfo", sulfur), is given to fumaroles with sulfurous gases.
