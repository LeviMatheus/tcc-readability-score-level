William Shakespeare (April, 1564 - April 23, 1616) was an English writer. He wrote plays and also some poetry. Many people consider him to be the greatest English writer of all time and one of the greatest in the world. He wrote plays about history and tragedy and he wrote comedies. His poetry and plays are about being human, with feelings such as love, jealousy, anger, and much more. Children learn about him in schools around the world. Shakespeare wrote his works between about 1590 and 1613.
Who wrote "Shakespeare"?
About 150 years after Shakespeare died, some writers began to say that the works we call "Shakespeare" were not really written by William Shakespeare. They had various reasons for saying this. For example, the person who wrote "Shakespeare" knew a lot about other countries (especially Italy), but William Shakespeare never left England as far as we know.
Several other writers of "Shakespeare" have been suggested, such as Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, and Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford. Most scholars believe that William Shakespeare did write the works that bear his name, but the idea that someone else "wrote Shakespeare" still gets discussed a lot.
