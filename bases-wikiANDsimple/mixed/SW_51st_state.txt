51st state, is a humorous term in American politics that refers to (talks about) a land, which is not a part of USA, but is thought to be added to the United States, becoming the 51st state. Sometimes "51st state" is said seriously (about American Samoa or other territories). Usually it is a joke about Canada (even though Canada is an independent country) because Canada is right next to America and both countries are English-speaking. Before the year 1959, which is when Alaska and Hawaii became states, the word "the 49th state" was used. Less often, "51st State" refers to countries that seem to be controlled by the United States.
The term is used in Canada and other countries to show bad U.S. influence. In Europe and Australia, people who think their culture has become too much like America's culture sometimes use the term "51st state" about their own countries. In Europe, it can also mean Iceland because USA is a very important country in Icelandic politics and economy, Finland because American culture is very popular in Finland, or Great Britain, because people speak English language both in USA and Great Britain.
The term 51st state usually means non-Americans who like American culture and act like Americans, or a non-American politician who is a supporter of the United States, especially its foreign politics.
Political regions of the United States that are not states right now that might become the 51st state are Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, Washington, D.C., Guam, or American Samoa. Parts of states that might become their own state include New York City in New York, the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and Chicago in Illinois. Regions that include land which is now in two different states that might become a state include Jefferson (Northern California and Southern Oregon) and Lincoln (Eastern Washington and the Idaho Panhandle, or the thin part).
