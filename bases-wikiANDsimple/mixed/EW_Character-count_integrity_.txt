Character-count integrity is a telecommunications term for the ability of a certain link to preserve the number of characters in a message (per unit time, in the case of a user-to-user connection). Character-count integrity is not the same as character integrity, which requires that the characters delivered be, in fact, exactly the same as they were originated.
