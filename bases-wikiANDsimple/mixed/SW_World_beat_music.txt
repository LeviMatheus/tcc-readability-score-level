World beat music is a type of music. It is usually not in the English language and the musician's recordings are usually done in places outside the countries that comprise of being a part of Western civilization. Songs in the world beat music genre tend to be longer than four minutes (which is the standard amount of time for most songs in Western civilization).
This genre of music is increasingly emerging in popular culture, as heard in the Sony PlayStation 2 video game, "FIFA 07", which is a soccer game that features many modes of difficulty from amateur to legendary status. Soccer fans are most likely to be world beat listeners while NASCAR fans are most likely to listen to either country music and/or rock and roll music.
