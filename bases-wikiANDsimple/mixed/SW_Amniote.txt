The amniotes are a taxonomical family of animals. They are a group of tetrapod vertebrates that include the Synapsida (mammals and mammal-like reptiles) and Sauropsida (reptiles and dinosaurs, including birds). The embryos of amniotes are either laid as eggs or carried by the female. These embyros are protected by several membranes. In humans, these membranes include the amniotic sac that surrounds the fetus. These embryonic membranes are why amniotes are different from other tetrapods, the amphibians.
The first amniotes looked similar to small lizards. They evolved 340 million years ago. Their eggs could survive out of the water. This let amniotes move into environments that had less water. The amniotes moved across the Earth. Almost all vertebrates that live mainly on land are amniotes.
