The Walt Disney Company, commonly nicknamed Disney, is one of the largest entertainment and media companies in the world. It was started in 1923 by Walt Disney and his brother, Roy Oliver Disney, as the Disney Brothers Cartoon Studio. It had the name of Walt Disney Productions from the 1930s to early 1986.
Disney Enterprises Inc. is a subsidiary of the company; the name is found in many of its franchises.
Divisions.
The company's main units are Studio Entertainment, Parks and Resorts, Media Networks and Consumer Products.
Studio Entertainment.
One of the Studios' largest assets lies in Walt Disney Feature Animation, which has made a successful string of animated movies for almost seven decades. Because of failures with most of their recent additions, it has changed its focus from traditional hand-drawn to CGI movies. Pixar, its biggest rival (also owned by Disney), dominates the latter industry.
Parks and Resorts.
Disney once owned the sports teams, the Angels (baseball) and the Mighty Ducks (ice hockey), both based in Anaheim, California. They are now the property of lone businessmen.
Media Networks.
The ABC television network, which Disney bought in 1996, serves as the centre of this unit. Cable television channels within it include Disney Channel, Toon Disney, ABC Family, ESPN and SOAPnet.It also partly owns Lifetime, A&E and E!.
Buena Vista Television, responsible for the syndication of many Disney series, produces some of its own as well: "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", "Live with Regis and Kelly", and "Ebert & Roeper".
Consumer Products.
Merchandising and licensing within the company are overseen in this division. Disney Publishing Worldwide, part of this unit, has Disney Press, Disney Editions and Hyperion Books as its brands.
It once owned the Disney Store shopping chain until 2004. Jim Henson's Muppets have taken its place since then.
