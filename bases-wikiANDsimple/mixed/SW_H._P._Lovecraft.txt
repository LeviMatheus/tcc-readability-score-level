Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 â€“ March 15, 1937) was an American author of fantasy, horror and science fiction. Lovecraft was from Providence, Rhode Island.
He wrote many really scary short stories. These often were about weird creatures that Lovecraft made up by himself or with his friend, August Derleth, who wrote mysteries. The creatures did not really care about human people at all, so they weren't out to hurt people, but if they did, they didn't care. They looked at us like we would be ants. Their behaviour, attitude and look also tended to make people go crazy.
Lovecraft's stories were inspiration for lots of other authors and writers.
