Cunnilingus is the act of a man or another woman performing oral sex using the mouth, lips, and tongue to stimulate the female sex organs. The clitoris is the most sensitive part of the female genitalia. The term comes from a Latin word for the vulva ("cunnus") and from the Latin word for tongue ("lingua"). Most women achieve orgasm easily from clitoral stimulation as part of cunnilingus.
