A prophecy is a claim on how the future will be like, which is not based on any ordinary source of information. In some ways, prophecies are similar to religion. They are often hard to understand and need interpretation. Very often, they concern one very specific event. In earlier times, people who made prophecies were called prophets. In Ancient Greece, people who made prophecies were called oracles, most notably the Oracle of Delphi. In modern times, people like Nostradamus made prophecies.
