Betta Splendens is a species of fish from Thailand, often kept in aquariums. Because the males fight each other, they cannot be kept together.
Appearance.
Males have a tendency to have longer caudual fins. They also "flare" their gill covers wider than females. They come in many colors.
How they behave.
The males will fight each other and can't be put together. They will also nip (bite) the fins of some fish. The females sometimes fight but can be kept in groups.
