Saint Helena is an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. It is in the South Atlantic Ocean. It consists of the island of Saint Helena, as well as the dependencies of Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Napoleon was sent to this island by the British and their allies as a result of Napoleon's return from Elba and loss at the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon died there in 1821.
