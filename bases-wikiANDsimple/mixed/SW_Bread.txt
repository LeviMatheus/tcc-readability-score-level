Bread is a type of food, made from flour and water (to make dough). Usually, salt and yeast are added.
Colour and taste depend largely on the kind of flour used and the style of baking. Flour made from the whole grain gives darker bread. Flour made just from the polished wheat grain gives a very white bread. Also rye and barley flour give darker types of bread.
Bread is an important part of life in many countries, because everyone eats it. In many cultures, bread is so important that it is part of their religious rituals.
Cake is done in a similar way to bread but sugar, fat and milk are added to the dough and often more ingredients.
