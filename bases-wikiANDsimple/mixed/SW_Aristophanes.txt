Aristophanes (born around 450-445 BC â€“ died around 385 BC) was a Greek writer who wrote 40 plays. However, only 11 of his plays survive in their entirety. He is famous for writing comedies (funny plays), and even today his plays make people laugh.
Many of the jokes in his plays relate to sex. For example, "Lysistrata" is about a group of women who protest a war by not having sexual intercourse with their husbands until the war is ended.
Another well known play by Aristophanes is "The Frogs".
