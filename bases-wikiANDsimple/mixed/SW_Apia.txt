Apia, population 380,800 (2001), is the capital of Samoa. It is part of the Tuamasaga district. The city is located on the northern coast of Upolu Island. It is the nation's major port and only city. Fish and copra are the country's major exports, and cotton goods, motor vehicles, meats, and sugar are the major imports.
Location.
Apia () is located on a natural dock at the mouth of the Vaisigano River. It is on a narrow coastal plain with Mount Vaea (height 472 m) directly to its south. Two main ridges run south on either side of the Vaisigano River, with roads on each sides. The more western of these is Cross Island Road, the fewer roads crossing to the south coast of Upolu.
Other city.
Mulinu'u, the old capital, is the location of the Parliament House ("Fale Fono") and the historic observatory, which is now the meteorology office. In 1983, the Apia Samoa Temple was built here by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
