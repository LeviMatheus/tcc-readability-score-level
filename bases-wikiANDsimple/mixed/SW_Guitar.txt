The guitar is string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood, and they usually have metal or nylon strings or both. The guitar strings are plucked with the fingers of the right hand, or a small pick made of thin plastic. This type of pick is called a "plectrum". The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers press the strings to the fretboard. Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes.
Guitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years. In many countries and at many different time periods, guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular, because they are light to carry from place to place, they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments. Guitars are used for many types of music, from Classical to Rock. Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars.
There are many different types of guitars, classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for. All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow. This makes the sound of the strings louder, and gives the guitar its quality. This type of guitar is called "acoustic". (An "acoustic" instrument is one that makes its own dynamics.)
From the 1930s, people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness. These guitars, which are often used in popular music, are called "electric guitars". They do not need to have a hollow body. This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound.
Most guitars have six strings, but there are also guitars with four, seven, eight, ten, or twelve strings. More strings make the instrument sound fuller. The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets. Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing.
Word origin.
The word "guitar" was adopted into English from Spanish word "guitarra" in the 1600s. In the Middle ages the word "gitter" or "gittern" was used in England. Both "guitarra" and "gitter" came from the Latin word "cithara". The word "cithara" came from the earlier Greek word "kithara". "Kithara" could have come from the Persian word "sihtar". The sihtar itself is related to the Indian instrument, the sitar.
A person who plays a guitar is called a guitarist. A person who makes or mends (fixes) guitars is a "luthier", which comes from the word "lute". The word "lute", comes from the Arabic "Al-Uud", a stringed instrument from the Middle East.
Types of guitars.
A guitar was described by Dr. Michael Kasha as an instrument that had "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often with incurved sides".
Modern guitars come in four main types. The classical guitar is used for classical music. The term acoustic guitar is generally used for a guitar used for popular music, even though a classical guitar is also an acoustic instrument. There are many other different types of acoustic guitars from different parts of the world.
A electric guitar is flat, not hollow, and produces sound through amplifiers. Some guitars combine the hollow acoustic body with amplified sound. Bass guitars are designed to make a low bass rhythm.
A special electric folding travel guitar called the Foldaxe (briefly manufactured by Hoyer in 1977) was invented for Chet Atkins (in Atkins' book "Me and My Guitars") by inventor and guitarist Roger Field, featuring a built-in mechanism which kept the string tension and tuning constant even when folded, and ready to play when unfolded. Atkins demonstrated his several times on US television, and also on The Today Show with Les Paul who was with him as a guest.
History.
There have been instruments like the guitar for at least 5,000 years. The guitar may have come from older instruments known as the sitara from ancient India and central Asia. The oldest known picture of a guitar-like instrument is a 3300 year old stone carving of a Hittite bard. The oldest guitar-like instrument that is still complete is the "Warwick Gittern" in the British Museum. It belonged to Elizabeth I of England and probably to her father Henry VIII before it was given to her. It is about 500 years old.
The design of the modern guitar began with the Roman cithara. The cithara was brought by the Romans to Hispania (Spain) around 40 AD. In the 8th century the Moors brought the four-stringed oud into Spain. The introduction to the oud caused changes to the design of the cithara. AD. In other parts of Europe, the six-string Scandinavian "lut" (lute) became popular wherever the Vikings had been. By 1200 AD, there were two types of the four string "guitar": the "guitarra morisca" (Moorish guitar) from Spain which had a rounded back, wide fingerboard and several soundholes, and the "guitarra latina" (Latin guitar) which was more like the modern guitar with one soundhole and a narrower neck.
The Spanish "vihuela", of the 16th century, was another guitar-like instrument. It had lute-style tuning and a guitar-like body. The vihuela was only popular for a short amount of time. It is not known whether it was simply a design that combined features of the oud and lute or a transition from the Renaissance instrument to the modern guitar.
The Vinaccia family from Naples, Italy were famous mandolin makers. It is thought that they also made the oldest six-string guitar that still exists. There is a guitar built that was signed and dated 1779 on the label by Gaetano Vinaccia (1759 - after 1831) Although there are many fakes that have dates on them from that time, this guitar is believed by experts to be genuine (real).
The guitar's design was improved (made better) by the famous Spanish luthier, Antonio Torres Jurado (1817-1892) and by Louis Panormo of London.
The electric guitar was made by George Beauchamp in 1936. Beauchamp co-founded a company called Rickenbacher to make guitars. However, Danelectro was the first to produce electric guitars for the public to use.
More details about electric guitars.
Electric guitars have varying numbers of pickups (up to 6 or 8 in some custom built ones) but usually between one and three pickups that "pick up" the sound. Electric guitars typically have a lower action (distance between the strings and the frets) making them generally easier to play than most acoustic guitars that usually have a higher action. Electric guitars sometimes feedback (this is when the strings begin to resonate from the sound that is coming from the speaker(s))causing oscillation (simply put the signal begins to move in a circle strings->pickup->cable->amp->speaker->air->strings->etc.) This is usually prevented by placing your picking hand (the hand nearest the pickups) on the strings near the bridge during a pause in playing, or turning down the volume on the guitar. Some electric guitars have double coil pickups called humbuckers, while others have single coil pickups. A humbucker is simply two single coil pickups attached to each other and wired to each other. The purpose of a humbucker is control the amount of oscillation (feedback) and does so because of the way that the two single coil pickups are wired in relation to each other. This alleviates the feedback and 60 cycle hum that plagues some single coil pickups as well as providing a deeper, warmer, fuller sounding tone than single coil pickups.
Guitar music.
Guitars are used in many different genres of music, such as traditional, regional, and folk to modern punk, rock, metal or pop. Guitars are used as rhythm instruments, lead instruments, and sometimes a combination of the two.
