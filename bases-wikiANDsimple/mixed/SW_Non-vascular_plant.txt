Non-vascular plants is a general term for those plants without a vascular system (xylem and phloem). Although non-vascular plants have not these particular tissues, a number of non-vascular plants possess tissues specialized for internal transport of water.
Nonvascular plants have no roots, stems, or leaves, since each of these structures is defined by containing vascular tissue.
Non-vascular groups.
In the past, the term "non-vascular plant" included all the algae, but also the fungi as well. Today, it is recognized that these groups are not closely related to plants, and have a very different biology.
