A refrigerator is a machine for keeping things cold. It is sometimes called an icebox (this word is used mainly by Americans) or a fridge. People put food and drinks in it, to keep it cold or good (unspoiled) for a longer time. In general, a refrigerator can be seen as a heat pump. It takes heat away from the air inside the fridge. The heat gets added to the air from outside. For this, it usually uses electricity.
There are also ice boxes available that do not need electricity because they are filled with ice. The ice can keep things cold until the ice melts. These ice boxes are often taken on camping trips. These are often called coolers. Refrigerator-sized iceboxes were used before electricity was available.
Most modern refrigerators are available in a variety of colors and shapes.
