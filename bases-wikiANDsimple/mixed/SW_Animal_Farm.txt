"Animal Farm" is a book by George Orwell. The story is a modern fable and allegory. The story is about a group of animals who throw out the humans from the farm they live on and run it themselves. What starts out well turns into a brutal tyranny on its own. It was written during World War II and published in 1945. The book was not widely successful until the late 1950s.
"Animal Farm" is a critique and satire of Soviet totalitarianism. Many events in the book are based on events from the Soviet Union during the Stalin era. (For example, the character Snowball, a pig who is expelled from the Farm by Napoleon, is clearly modelled on Trotsky.) Orwell was a critic of Stalin, and suspicious of Moscow-directed state socialism after his experiences in the Spanish Civil War.
