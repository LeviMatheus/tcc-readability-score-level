Sunlight is light that comes from the sun. Plants use sunlight to make food. Without sunlight, there could be no life on Earth.
Plants need sunlight for the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis the plants use the energy of the sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide, to create glucose (sugar). The glucose can later be used by the plant for energy. Or animals eat the plant and the glucose in it.
Plants need sunlight to grow green. Without sunlight but with enough water, the plant grows very tall very quickly, but looks yellow and dehydrated, although when touched, the leaves are very very moist.
Sunlight can be both good and bad for a person's health. When in the light, the human body makes its own Vitamin D. Being in sunlight too much can cause sunburn.
