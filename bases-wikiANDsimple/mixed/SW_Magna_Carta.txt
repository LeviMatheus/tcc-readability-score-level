The Magna Carta was a document King John of England was forced to sign by English nobles so that kings would not have as much power as before. King John signed it in 1215. It led to the constitutional rule of today. The Magna Carta was a great influence to the American Constitution and to the Bill of Rights. It stated that people had the right against unlawful imprisonment called Habeas Corpus among other rules. The Mangna Carta was sent out again in 1225 by Henry 3rd.
