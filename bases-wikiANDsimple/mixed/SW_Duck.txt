Duck is the common name for several species of birds in the family "Anatidae". Ducks are closely related to swans and geese. Other swimming and diving birds, like grebes and loons, are sometimes wrongly called ducks. A baby duck is called a "duckling", and a male duck is called a "drake". Ducks are aquatic birds. They can be found in both saltwater and fresh water.
Some ducks are bred and kept by humans. They are not wild ducks. They are kept to provide food (meat and eggs), or to use their feathers for pillows and other items in the house. Especially in Asia, many people like to eat duck. Nobody knows how long a duck can live for.
Ducks are sometimes kept as pets. They are often kept by groups of people on public ponds for their beauty and calming nature.
