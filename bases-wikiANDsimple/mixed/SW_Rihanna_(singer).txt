The music video, directed by Anthony Mandler, was shot on an indoor soundstage in Castaic, California on April 23 2008. One of the sets had to be repainted between takes. An MTV News reporter called the video "a fairly glam affair", and Levine referred to it as "this kind of ultra-glamorous, photography-based, late-'70s/ early-'80s situation" and "really stylish and really beautiful", saying that "[Rihanna's] physical presence is undeniable". "The Guardian" wrote, "The concept appears to be high-end erotica [...] If the [smartly furnished] sets resemble the kind of rooms nobody really lives in, then Rihanna sports a selection of outfits nobody really wears". The video premiered on May 13 on "Total Request Live". Rihanna said on The Today Show, when she went to perform for the Toyota Concert Series, and MTV's TRL that this was once of her favorite videos to make and enjoyed it.
