The Kakapo ("Strigops habroptilus") is the only parrot that can not fly and is mostly active at night ("nocturnal"). This bird is from rainforests and grasslands of New Zealand. Kakapos like to be alone. To keep other kakapos out of their territory, they make a 'skraaarking' sound. The kakapo will live for about 60 years.
Description.
The kakapo had no natural enemies on the islands of New Zealand were it lives. At one time there were many kakapo. Now fewer than 100 kakapo still live in New Zealand. It is a critically endangered species. The decrease in the number of kakapo is mostly from predatory animals (for example, cats, dogs, stoats, ferrets, and rats) that settlers brought with them to New Zealand. The kakapo was also eaten by Maori and European settlers. Kakapo means 'night parrot' in the Maori language.
Diet.
Kakapos are herbivores ("plant-eaters"). They eat roots, seeds, leaves, buds, cones, fruit, and flowers.
Reproduction.
Unlike other parrots, male kakapos gather together to compete with the other males and to call females with a deep booming sound. There are 2 to 3 eggs in each set of eggs laid. The eggs are laid in a hollow part of a tree. The female incubates the eggs for 10 weeks. She only leaves the eggs when she leaves to find food.
