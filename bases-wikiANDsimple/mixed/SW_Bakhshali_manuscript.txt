The Bakhshali Manuscript is a mathematical manuscript written on birch bark. It was found in 1881 near the village of Bakhshali in what was then the North-West Frontier Province of British India (now Pakistan). Most of the manuscript is missing, only seventy leaves of birch bark remain.
No-one knows how old it is and different scholars have come up with different dates. Most scholars agree that the manuscript is a copy of a more ancient text.
