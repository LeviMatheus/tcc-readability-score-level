The English free settlers were the people that chose to go to Australia. They were not forced to go there like the convicts were. The English free settlers went to Australia between the late 17th century and the early 18th century. This was after the convicts were sent to Australia. When the English free settlers got to Australia, they landed in the southern part of the continent. That was the only colony created by the free settlers.
The English free settlers went to Australia to be free. They wanted to make money as well. They also wanted to explore Australia. Most of them were families who wanted a better life with their children. Some people called the English Free settlers "Pilgrims".
