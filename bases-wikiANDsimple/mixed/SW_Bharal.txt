The bharal or Himalayan blue sheep ("Pseudois nayaur") is a mammal of the Caprinae subfamily.
The bharal is found in the high Himalayas of Nepal, Tibet, China, Kashmir, Pakistan, Bhutan and the Republic of India.
The bharal has horns that grow upwards, curve out and then towards the back, somewhat like an upside down mustache.
