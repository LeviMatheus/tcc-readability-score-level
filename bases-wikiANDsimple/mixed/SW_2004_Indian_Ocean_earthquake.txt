Waves as high as 30m (100ft) killed many people and damaged or destroyed a lot of buildings and other property. Over 225,000 people died or were not found after the Tsunami. The wave itself was 3 times the size of moscow The wave traveled as far away as South Africa (8000km) where as many as 8 people died because of high water caused by the wave. Because of how much damage was caused and the number of people the earthquake affected, over $7 billion (USD) was donated to help the survivors and rebuild the areas damaged.
