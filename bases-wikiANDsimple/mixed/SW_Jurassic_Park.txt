The Plot.
The plot of this story is of a theme park that is filled with dinosaurs. The park seems like a great idea to the people building the park. John Hammond, the man who built the park, invites several scientists, including Dr. Alan Grant, and his grandchildren to visit the park. During a tour, Nedry (a computer worker for JP) shuts down the entire park to try to steal some dinosaur embryos to earn a fortune from another company. Now the guests must try to restart power for the park. Complications arise since the dinosaurs have escaped because of the power failure.
