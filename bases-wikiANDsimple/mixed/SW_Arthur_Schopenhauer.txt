Arthur Schopenhauer (February 22, 1788 â€“ September 21, 1860) was a German philosopher.
Schopenhauer believed that the primary characteristic, or essence of all things - including human beings - is not intelligence, rationality or spirit, but will. By 'will' he means a blind, amazingly powerful force that forces everything, from a rock to George Bush, into existence for no real reason, as it has no real reason itself for existing and because of this, there is immense amounts of suffering in the world. He also believed that a "better consciousness" could be attained by denying the fulfilment our desires, taking time to think about who we really are and what we should do to avoid suffering - but also, in doing something few philosophers of his day spoke of: in making and looking at works of art, especially music, which he considered one of the few justifications for human existence.
Schopenhauer was a huge influence on Richard Wagner, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Thomas Mann, Sigmund Freud, Leo Tolstoy, Carl Jung and many other important artists and thinkers of the 20th Century.
