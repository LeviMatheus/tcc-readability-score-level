The North Pole is the northern point of the axis around which the Earth turns. It is located in the Arctic Ocean which receives very little heat from the sun. This means that the Ocean around the pole is always very cold and it is covered by a thick sheet of ice.
There is also a Magnetic North Pole. It is near the above North Pole. A compass points toward the magnetic North Pole.
There is a star, called the North Star or the Pole Star, that always appears in the sky above the North Pole. For hundreds of years sailors were able to tell how far north they were by seeing how high the North Star appeared in the sky.
Polar bears live in the Arctic. They are animals that eat meat, so they need to hunt to remain lively. The bears, in a general way, usually are violent to protect themselves and their cubs.
