A resonator is something that makes a sound bigger. The sound resonates.
Electromagnetics.
In electromagnetics a cavity resonator is a resonator composed of a space that is usually surrounded by a dielectric which makes particular frequencies.
Music.
Most musical instruments have resonators. They are the parts which makes the sound louder. A vibraphone, for example, has long tubes underneath the keys. It also has a special effect: a mechanism which, when it is turned on, opens and shuts the resonators very quickly so that a trembling sound is heard.
The body of a violin is a resonator: without the body the sound of the string vibrating would hardly be heard, just as the sound of an elastic band stretched between two fingers can hardly be heard.
