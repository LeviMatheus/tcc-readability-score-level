The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is a group that works to create a state for Palestinians. The group was created in 1964. From 1993 to 1998 they made agreements with Israel that created the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which is in charge of leading Gaza and the West Bank. The leader of the PLO used to be Yasser Arafat. He signed a series of Peace Treaties called the Olso Accords with Yitzhak Rabin who the Prime Minister of Israel at the time. Many members of the PLO and Israel didn't agree with the Accords and Yasser was soon killed by his own people. Israel also re-elected another Prime Minister to take Rabin's position after the Accords.
