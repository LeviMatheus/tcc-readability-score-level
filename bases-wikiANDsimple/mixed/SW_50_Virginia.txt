50 Virginia is a big, very dark Main belt asteroid. It was found by J. Ferguson on October 4, 1857. R. Luther found it on his own on October 19, and his discovery was announced first. The reason for Virginia's name is not known. It is probably named after Verginia, the Roman noblewoman slain by her father, but it may also have been named after the American state of Virginia.
