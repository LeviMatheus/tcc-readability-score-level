The "Kaiten" (Japanese: 回天, translated "Change the World" or "Reverse Destiny") was a torpedo that was changed as a suicide weapon, and used by the Navy of the Empire of Japan in the last months of the Second World War. It was basically a torpedo with a pilot, and it could be thrown from a submarine or a ship.
The "Kaiten" was not very effective. Out of more or less 100 attacks made with them, only two enemy ships were sunk.
