The Province of Carolina was a British colony in North America from 1663 to 1729. It covered the present states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and a part of Florida. An argument over how the it would be governed led to its becoming the Province of North Carolina and the Province of South Carolina. Officially, these two provinces did not become separate colonies until 1729.
