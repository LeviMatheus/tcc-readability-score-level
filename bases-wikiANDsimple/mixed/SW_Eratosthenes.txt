Eratosthenes of Cyrene (Greek; 276 BC - 194 BC) was a Greek mathematician, poet, athlete, geographer and astronomer. He made several remarkable discoveries and inventions: he invented a system of latitude and longitude. He was the first person to calculate the circumference of the Earth (with remarkable accuracy), and the tilt of the earth's axis (again with remarkable accuracy); he may also have accurately calculated the distance from the earth to the sun and invented the leap day. He also created a map of the world based on the available geographical knowledge of the era. Eratosthenes was also the founder of scientific chronology; he wanted to fix the dates of the chief literary and political events from the conquest of Troy.
