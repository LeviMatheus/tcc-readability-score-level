Iambe was the goddess of rhyme and merriment in Greek mythology. She was the daughter of Pan and Echo.
Iambic pentameter.
Iambe created the iambic pentameter verse pattern in poetry. This is a metered verse with two different sounds, and it was named after Iambe. The imabic pentameter verse is used by many poets, one of which is William Shakespeare.
Demeter.
The goddess, Demeter, was sad about loosing her daughter, Persephone. It was only Iambe who was able to make Demeter laugh. She did this by using poetry and wit to cheer Demeter up. When Demeter was not sad any more, the earth became fertile again. Iambe then became Demeter's first priestess.
