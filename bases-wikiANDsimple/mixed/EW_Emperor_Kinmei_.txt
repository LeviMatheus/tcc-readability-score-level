 was the 29th Emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.
His reign is said to have spanned the years from 539 to 571. Kinmei is the first Japanese Emperor for whom contemporary historiography is able to assign verifiable dates.
Traditional narrative.
Kinmei's contemporary title would not have been "tennō", as most historians believe this title was not introduced until the reigns of [[Emperor Tenmu]] and [[Empress Jitō]]. Rather, it was presumably , meaning "the great king who rules all under heaven". Alternatively, Kinmei might have been referred to as or the "Great King of Yamato".
Events of Kinmei's life.
Because of several chronological discrepancies in the account of Emperor Kinmei in the "[[Nihon Shoki]]", some believe that he was actually ruling a rival court to that of Emperors [[Emperor Ankan|Ankan]] and [[Emperor Senka|Senka]]. Nevertheless, according to the traditional account, it was not until the death of Emperor Kinmei's older brother Emperor Senka that he gained the throne.
According to this account, Emperor Senka died in 539 at the age of 73; and succession passed to the third son of [[Emperor Keitai]]. This Imperial Prince was the next youngest brother of Emperor Senka. He would come to be known as Emperor Kinmei. He established his court at in [[Yamato Province|Yamato]].
The Emperor's chief counselors were:
Although the imperial court was not moved to the [[Asuka, Nara|Asuka]] region of Japan until 592, Emperor Kinmei's rule is considered by some to be the beginning of the [[Asuka period]] of [[Yamato period|Yamato]] Japan, particularly by those who associate the Asuka period primarily with the introduction of [[Buddhism]] to Japan from [[Baekje]].
According to the "Nihon Shoki", Emperor Kinmei received a bronze statue of [[Gautama Buddha]] as a gift from the king of [[Baekje]] King [[Seong of Baekje|Song Myong]] (聖明王, "Seimei Ō") along with a significant envoy of artisans, monks, and other artifacts in 552. (However, according to the [[Jōgū Shōtoku Hōō Teisetsu]], Buddhism was introduced in 538.) This episode is widely regarded as the official introduction of Buddhism to the country.
With the introduction of a new religion to the court, a deep rift developed between the [[Mononobe clan]], who supported the worship of [[kami|Japan's traditional deities]], and the Soga clan, who supported the adoption of Buddhism.
According to the "Nihon Shoki", Emperor Kinmei ruled until his death in 571 and was buried in the . An alternate stronger theory holds that he was actually buried in the , located in .
The Emperor is traditionally venerated at a [[memorial]] [[Shinto]] [[shrine]] ("misasagi") at Nara. The [[Imperial Household Agency]] designates the Nara location as Kinmei's [[mausoleum]]. It is formally named "Hinokuma no saki Ai no misasagi"; however, the actual sites of the [[grave (burial)|graves]] of the early Emperors remain problematic, according to some historians and archaeologists.
Genealogy.
Emperor Kinmei's father was [[Emperor Keitai]] and his mother was [[Emperor Ninken]]'s daughter, . In his lifetime, he was known by the name .
Kinmei had six Empresses and 25 Imperial children (16 sons and 9 daughters). According to Nihongi, he had six wives, but the "Kojiki" gives only five wives; identifying the third consort to be the same as the sixth one. The first three were his nieces, daughters of his half-brother Emperor Senka; two others were sisters, daughters of the Omi Soga no Iname.
