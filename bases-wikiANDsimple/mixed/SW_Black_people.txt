Black people are a ethnic group, like white people and Hispanics. Black people usually have dark skin and broad noses, but can also have light skin and moderate noses.
Black people originated in Africa. They were the victims in the major slave trade, which resulted in many black people living in the United States and the Caribbean. In the United States, there was a civil rights movement. One of the leaders of this movement was Martin Luther King. The movement took place in the 1960s, after black people had been treated badly and not considered equal for many years. This is known as racism. Currently black people have equal rights in all major countries, but still often face discrimination.
