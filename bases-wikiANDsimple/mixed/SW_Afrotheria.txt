Afrotheria is a group of mammals (a superorder or cohort), containing the golden moles, elephant shrews, tenrecs, aardvarks, hyraxes, elephants and manatees. Scientists made this group based on DNA analyses. Experiments in the 1990s have named Afrotheria as one of four major groups in the group Eutheria (containing placental mammals). Afrotheria means "African animals", "afro" for Africa and "theria" for animals. Many animals in the group seem to be at a high risk of extinction. If the scientists are correct in grouping the animals in afrotheria together, this would be a huge loss of different animals in the same group.
Some scientists do not agree with grouping the animals in afrotheria together.
