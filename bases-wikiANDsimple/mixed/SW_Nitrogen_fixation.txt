Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen is taken from its stable gas form (N2) in air and changed into other nitrogen compounds (such as ammonia, nitrate and nitrogen dioxide) useful for other chemical processes. It is an important part of the nitrogen cycle.
Biological nitrogen fixation was discovered by Martinus Beijerinck.
