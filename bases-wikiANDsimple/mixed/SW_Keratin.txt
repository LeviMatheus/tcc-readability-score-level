Keratins are a family of fibrous structural proteins.
They are tough and insoluble, they form the hard but nonmineralized structures that one can find in reptiles, birds, amphibians and mammals. A similar biological toughness one can find only by chitin.
There are various types of keratins, even within a single animal.
Variety of animal uses.
Arthropods such as crustaceans often have parts of their armor or exoskeleton made of keratin, sometimes in combination with chitin.
Keratins are also found in the gastrointestinal tracts of many animals, including roundworms (who also have an outer layer made of keratin).
Although it is now difficult to be certain, the scales, claws, some protective armour and the beaks of dinosaurs would, almost certainly, have been composed of a type of keratin.
Silk.
The silk fibroins produced by insects and spiders are often classified as keratins, though it is unclear whether they are phylogenetically related to vertebrate keratins.
Silk found in insect pupae, and in spider webs and egg casings, also has twisted Î²-pleated sheets incorporated into fibers wound into larger supermolecular aggregates.
