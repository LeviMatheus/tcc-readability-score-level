Doge (plural dogi or doges) is a word of an Italian dialect that comes from the Latin "dux" (as does the English "duke" and the standard Italian "duce"), that means "leader", especially in a military context.
The title of Doge was used for the elected chief of state in a number of Italian "crowned republics". The two best known such republics were Venice and Genoa, which had both maritime, commercial, and territorial mini-empires.
