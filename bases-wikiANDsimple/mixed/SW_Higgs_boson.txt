The Higgs boson is an elementary particle that has been thought to give everything mass, but it may or may not exist. It is the only particle predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics that has not yet been found. Physicists hope that experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will find this particle. The LHC was turned on for the first time on 10 September 2008.
