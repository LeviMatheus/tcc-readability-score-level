The word berry is used for many different kinds of small fruits that has many seeds and can be eaten. Some examples are strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and lingonberry.
A berry can be either one fruit (like strawberry) or many fruits joined together like raspberry).
Berries are small, sweet, juicy, bright coloured fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more animals towards them and spread their seeds.
In daily life, grapes, currants, cranberries, blueberries, gooseberries, strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and boysenberris, are berries.
However, botanists (people who study plants) say that strawberries, blackberries, raspberries and boysenberries are not berries. Instead, they say that tomatoes, eggplants (brinjals), guavas, pomegranates and chillies are berries. Pumpkins, cucumbers, melons, oranges and lemons are modified (changed) berries.
