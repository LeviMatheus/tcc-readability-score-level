Budapest is the capital city of Hungary. Budapest was founded in 1873. In that year three cities on the side of the Danube: Buda, Óbuda (Old Buda) and Pest were unified (made into one city). The city has a population of about 1.7 million people. Its highest point is János Hill (527 m.).
The main sights in Budapest are the Castle Hill ("Várhegy"), the Parliament ("Országház") and St. Stephen's Basilica. Budapest is also known for the ruins of Aquincum, the capital city of the Roman Province of Pannonia. The city has a great atmosphere with nice cafes, spas and the traditional Hungarian hospitality.
