The olive tree is a small tree. Its scientific name is "Olea europaea". Originally it came from the coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean, from Syria and the maritime parts of Asia Minor and northern Iran at the south end of the Caspian Sea. It has been cultivated for a very long time. The old Greeks were cultivating it. They spread the trees to the western part of the Mediterranean.
Olive trees like soils with lots of chalk in them. They grow best on limestone slopes and crags in coastal climate.
Description of the tree.
The Wild Olive is a small, straggly tree or shrub to 8-15 m tall with thorny branches. The leaves are opposite, oblong pointed, 4-10 cm long and 1-3 cm broad. The leaves have a dark greyish-green color above and are pale with whitish scales below. The small white flowers, with four-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the last year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small drupe 1-2 cm long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars.
Cultural significance.
Very probably, the first olive trees were grown in Syria. From there they spread rapidly. In Ancient Greece, the tree was seen as holy, some city states (polis) like Athens put a penalty for cutting down olive trees.
The branches in the flag of the United Nations are those of an olive tree. The olive tree is a sign of peace.
