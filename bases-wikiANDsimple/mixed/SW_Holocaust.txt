The word holocaust means "complete destruction by fire". The ancient Greeks killed animals for their gods. This was called sacrifice. They believed some of the gods wanted every part of their sacrifices burnt, not just one part. This was a holocaust.
Now, the word holocaust means "the intentional killing of a large number of people."
World War II.
When the word "Holocaust" is spelled with a capital 'h', it usually means The "Holocaust" during World War II, when the Nazis killed millions of Jewish, Slavic, and Roma people in concentration camps. See also the article "The Holocaust".
Other holocausts.
There have been many holocausts through history. Some people see the killing of people from ethnic groups in Bosnia, which was called ethnic cleansing, and the killing of large numbers of Aborigines in Australia by settlers as holocausts. Others also call the mass killing of Native Americans by invading European forces a holocaust. The killings of millions of Africans during captivity or slavery is considered by African-American people and others as "The Black Holocaust."
The Genocide in Guatemala was similar to the World War II holocaust. Genocide is the deliberate and systematic killing of a national, racial, political, or cultural group. In Guatemala, the army and its paramilitary forces attacked many Guatemalan villages and murdered the people and destroyed the buildings. ["citation needed"]<includeonly></includeonly><noinclude>
