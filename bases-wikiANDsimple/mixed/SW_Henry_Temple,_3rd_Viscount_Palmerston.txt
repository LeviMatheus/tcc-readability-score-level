Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston, KG, GCB, PC (20 October 1784 â€“ 18 October 1865) was a British statesman who served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the mid-19th century. He began his parliamentary career as a Tory and ended it as a Liberal.
He is best remembered for his leading of British foreign policy in a period of time when the United Kingdom was at its strongest. He served as both Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister. Some of his actions, now sometimes termed liberal interventionist, were not liked by a lot of people at the time.
