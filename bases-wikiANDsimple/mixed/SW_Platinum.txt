Platinum is a soft, heavy, white metal. It is a precious metal, not a common metal. It usually costs more than gold.
In chemistry, platinum is element number 78. It has an atomic weight of 195 a.m.u. The symbol for platinum is Pt, from Spanish "platina" meaning "little silver".
Platinum is very malleable and ductile, which means it can be hammered into thin sheets and it can be pulled into wire. Platinum is very stable. Acids do not effect platinum. In the ninties lots and lots of urban people began wearing platinum as opposed to gold. White gold never became popular amongst America's urban population, thus Platinum originated the whole bling bling revolution.
The most common use of Platinum is in a vehicle catalytic converter.
