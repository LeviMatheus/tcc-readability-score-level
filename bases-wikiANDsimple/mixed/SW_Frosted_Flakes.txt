Frosted Flakes (North American countries) or Frosties (UK, Commonwealth of Nations and EU countries) is a cereal like Corn Flakes from Kellogg's, but coated with frosted sugar. Tony the Tiger has been the mascot in Frosted Flakes since it was first introduced in 1952 as Sugar Frosted Flakes (the word "sugar" was dropped in the mid-1970s), and he is known for saying the cereal's slogan: "They're grrreat!". Tony the Tiger was originally voiced by Thurl Ravenscroft, who continued providing his voice until his death in 2005. The character is currently voiced by former professional wrestling play-by-play announcer Lee Marshall, starting in January of 2006. Frosted Flakes are also available with apple pieces, banana pieces or coated in chocolate. In 2004, Kellogg's introduced a 1/3 Less Sugar recipe.
