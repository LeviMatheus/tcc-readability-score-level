The "Entente cordiale" (French for 'friendly agreement') was a number of agreements signed on 8 April 1904 between the United Kingdom and France. The two countries were worried that their two growing empires would cause a war between them. The Entente cordiale was the end of almost a millennium (one thousand years) of intermittent war (they were not fighting all the time). The agreement led to the Triple Entente (including Russia) that fought the Triple Alliance (Germany, Italy and Austria-Hungary) in the First World War. The Entente cordiale has lasted until modern times (now).
