Xylem is the water transporter cells of plants. It carries water around a plant.
Structure.
Xylem vessels are a long straight chain made of long dead cells known as vessel elements. The cells are arranged end to end and the cell walls which would normally surround the whole cell dissolve where ever they are touching another cell wall. This makes a tube (because there is no blocking cell wall) sometimes the cells are just filled with holes rather than have no blocking cell-wall.
The secondary walls of vessels are filled with lignin, a kind of glue. The thickness of a xylem vessel will vary, with a different thickness, the water can be carried along a tube more easily.
Function.
Xylem vessels work because of th transpiration stream. It is caused by the evaporation of water from the cells in the leaf to the atmosphere. This transpiration causes millions of tiny rings of cartilage to form in the cell wall of the leaf. The resulting surface tension causes pressure in the xylem that pulls the water from the roots and soil.
