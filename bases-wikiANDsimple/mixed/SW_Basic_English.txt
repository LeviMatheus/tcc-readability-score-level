Basic English is a made-up language written by Charles Kay Ogden. The idea of Basic English is to use easy words to explain harder thoughts.
Basic English ("British American Scientific International Commercial") has 850 basic words. From the 850 words, 600 are names of things. Most of the words can be learned using pictures. 150 are words to describe things (adjectives) and to describe verbs (adverbs). The last 100 words are verbs and conjunctions. Verbs are words that show actions, and conjunctions are words that help put sentences together.
Rules of word use.
The word use of Basic English is like full English, but the rules are much simpler, and there are fewer exceptions. Not all meanings of each word are allowed.
Ogden's rules of grammar for Basic English help people use the 850 words to talk about things and events in a normal way.
