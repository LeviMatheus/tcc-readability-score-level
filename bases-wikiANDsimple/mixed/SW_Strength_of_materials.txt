Strength of materials is important for the study of engineering materials and their mechanical behavior in general (such as stress, deformation, strain and stress-strain relations).
Strength is considered in terms of compressive strength, tensile strength, and shear strength, namely the limit states of compressive stress, tensile stress and shear stress are looked at.
