Jeanne Louise Calment (February 21, 1875 â€“ August 4, 1997) was a French supercentenarian who, at age 122 years 164 days, was the verified oldest person ever. She was active during her life, and lived on her own until she was almost 110, and talked a lot until months before her death. She became the oldest undisputed person ever in 1989, discounting the disputed cases of Carrie C. White and Shigechiyo Izumi.
