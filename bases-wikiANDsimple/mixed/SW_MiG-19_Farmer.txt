The MiG-19 Farmer was a Soviet fighter aircraft made by Mikoyan. It first flew in 1953, and was introduced in 1955. It was meant to replace the older MiG-17 Fresco. During the Vietnam War, it was used a little by the North Vietnamese, but not as much as the MiG-17 or MiG-21 Fishbed.
It had 3 30mm cannon, and could carry 4 bombs or rockets. It weighed 11,397 pounds (5,170 kilograms) empty and could weigh up to 19,621 pounds (8,900 kilograms) at the heaviest. It was powered by 2 Tumansky RD-9 jet engines, each had 7,165 pounds (3250 kilograms) of thrust with afterburner. It was 12 feet (3.6576 meters) high, had a wingspan of 29.5 feet (9 meters), and was 42 feet 11 in (13.1 meters) long. It could go 903 miles per hour (1,450 kilometers per hour), and was the first supersonic Soviet fighter.
Eventually, it was replaced by the newer MiG-21.
