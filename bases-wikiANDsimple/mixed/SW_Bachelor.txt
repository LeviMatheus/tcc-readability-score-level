A bachelor is someone who has not been married, does not have a boy or girlfriend and lives on their own or with a roommate. A female bachelor is sometimes known as a Bachelorette. A bachelor cannot have been married, as someone who is married but then divorced is called a divorc√©, not a bachelor.
Sometimes, when a bachelor is going to be married, a Bachelor party is organised to celebrate the last day that the person will be a bachelor for.
