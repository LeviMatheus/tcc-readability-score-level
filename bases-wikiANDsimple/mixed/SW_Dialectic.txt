In philosophy, dialectic is an argument or conflict between different groups of people. In Medieval Europe, dialectics (or logic) was one of the three beginning liberal arts all together known as the trivium, with the other members being rhetorics and grammar).
The goal of the dialectical process, usually called "dialectic" or "dialectics", is to try to resolve the disagreement through rational talk, and the search for the truth in the matter.
