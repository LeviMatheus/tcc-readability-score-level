A pathogen (which is also called infectious agent) is a "biological agent" (like a virus, bacteria, fungi or parasite) that causes a disease in its
Pathogenic bacteria: these are bacteria that cause disease in humans, animals and even plants. Some bacteria can only make a single host ill; however, others can cause problems for a number of hosts. This al depends on the host specificity of that particular pathogenic bacterium. The diseases and other physical problems are as diverse as the pathogens that cause them and can range from: food poisoning to tooth ache and even some types of cancer.
Pathogenic fungi: these are fungi that exhibit pathogenic qualities however; the fungi are split into two different kinds of pathogens, there are superficial ones, which are opportunistic and cannot survive inside the human body but instead cause problems like athleteâ€™s foot. But the select few that can survive within the human body are known as the true pathogens
Pathogenic bacteria are often found in the synthetic grass used to construct sports fields. This is a major problem, because the fields need to be regularly disinfected because the bacteria can not be broken down by any natural resources.
Pathogenic bacteria can be found in car tires.
