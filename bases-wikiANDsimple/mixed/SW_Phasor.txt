A phasor is a tool in mathematics. It is used to show numbers in a different coordinate system. Certain electronic components have models that can be described more easily by the use of phasors. Inductors add a +90ยบ "phase", while capacitors add -90ยบ "phase". Both elements work on the imaginary axis. Resistors have 0ยบ "phase", and are considered real.
