Dimmu Borgir is a black metal band founded in 1993 in Norway. Its name is Icelandic for a "dark castle".
The band's first recordings were in Norwegian, but nowadays most of the material is in English. The newest studio album is "In Sorte Diaboli" (2007), which entered the Norwegian album chart at No. 1 â€” the first time a black metal band has ever attained No. 1 position on a national album chart anywhere in the world. Dimmu Borgir's previous release, "Death Cult Armageddon", as well as Satyricon's "Now, Diabolical" previously reached No. 2 position on the Norwegian album chart.
A week after "In Sorte Diaboli" reached No. 1 on the Norweigan album charts, the album attained No. 43 on The Billboard 200, making them the first Norwegian band since the 80's pop group 'A-HA' to enter the U.S. Top 50.
"In Sorte Diaboli" features the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Strangely, the album has been banned by the UK album charts for questionable reasons.
