The tournament is played in January, during the Australian Summer. This means that many matches have to be stopped for a short time, because players feel dehydrated.
Before 1983, many of the best tennis players did not play at the tournament. This was because the Australian Open was far away and was not considered as important. In the 1980s more top players began entering the tournament and none of the top players have not played, unless because of injury, since 1995.
The winners in 2007 were Roger Federer and Serena Williams.
