A microwave oven (commonly called a microwave) is a machine that cooks food using microwaves, a type of radio wave. The idea was discovered when a scientist who was experimenting with radio waves saw his chocolate bar which he was holding at that time melt. He then knew that radio waves could cook food and invented the microwave oven.
Operation.
Food is placed inside the oven, and buttons on the screen are pressed to set how long the food should be cooked. Typically, a microwave oven is one of the fastest ways of cooking.
Function.
The microwave oven produces micro-waves. These micro-waves are capable of heating water very quickly and effectively. The food that is put in the oven has either a small amount of water or a large amount. When the machine is turned on, the micro-waves seek the water in the food and heat it up, thus heating the food around it.
