Practice or practise (a verb form in British English) is the act of repeating a behavior over and over, or doing an activity again and again.
It is a way to learn things faster, by repeating them. For example, sport teams practice to prepare for real games, or a musician practices for some hours every day, so he can play perfectly in his concert.
A practice can also mean the way something is done, like in "medical practice".
