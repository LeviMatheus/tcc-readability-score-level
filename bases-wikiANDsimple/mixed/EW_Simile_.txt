A simile () is a figure of speech that directly "compares" two things. Similes differ from other metaphors by highlighting the similarities between two things using comparison words such as "like", "as", "so", or " than", while other metaphors create an implicit comparison (i.e. saying something "is" something else). This distinction is evident in the etymology of the words: simile derives from the Latin word "similis" ("similar, like"), while metaphor derives from the Greek word "metapherein" ("to transfer"). While similes are mainly used in forms of poetry that compare the inanimate and the living, there are also terms in which similes are used for very important things.
Uses.
In comedy.
Similes are used extensively in British comedy, notably in the slapstick era of the 1960s and 1970s. In comedy, the simile is often used in negative style: "he was as daft as a brush." They are also used in comedic context where a sensitive subject is broached, and the comedian will test the audience with response to subtle implicit simile before going deeper. The sitcom "Blackadder" featured the use of extended similes, normally said by the title character. For example:
In languages other than English.
Given that similes emphasize affinities between different objects, they occur in many cultures and languages.
Arabic.
Sayf al-Din al-Amidi discussed Arabic similes in 1805: "On Substantiation Through Transitive Relations".
Vietnamese.
Thuy Nga Nguyen and Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2012) classify Vietnamese similes into two types: Meaning Similes and Rhyming Similes.
The following is an example:
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Nghèo như con mèo
&lt;br&gt;/ŋɛu ɲɯ kɔn mɛu/
&lt;br&gt;"Poor as a cat"
Whereas the above Vietnamese example is of a rhyming simile, the English simile "(as) poor as a church mouse" is only a semantic simile.
