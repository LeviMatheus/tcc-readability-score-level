Python is the name given to a number of constricting snakes. Such snakes are not venomous. The family in question is that of the "Pythonideae". Some people think it is related to that of the Boa snakes. However, boas produce live young, while pythons lay eggs. Pythons can be found in Australia, Southeast Asia and Africa. Pythons can grow to between 1 metre and 10 metres in length. Longer pythons have been seen, but the reports are not secured. Larger pythons can prey on animals as large as a house cat. In Africa, there are pythons that eat gazelles.
Despite their size, pythons are rarely dangerous to humans.
