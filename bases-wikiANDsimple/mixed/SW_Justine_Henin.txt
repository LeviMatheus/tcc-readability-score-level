Justine Henin (born June 1, 1982) is a Belgian former professional tennis player who used to be the World Number 1. She has won six Grand Slam singles titles, including four at the French Open. She has not yet won at Wimbledon. Her mental toughness and her one-handed backhand are reasons for her success in tennis. She was known as "Justine Henin-Hardenne" for a while, until she separated from her husband in 2007, and resumed her maiden name, Justine Henin. She retired in 2008.
