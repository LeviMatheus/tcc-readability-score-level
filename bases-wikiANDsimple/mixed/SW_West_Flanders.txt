West Flanders (Dutch: "West-Vlaanderen") is the westernmost province of the Flemish Region, also named Flanders, in Belgium. It borders (clockwise from the North) on the Netherlands, the Flemish province of East Flanders ("Oost-Vlaanderen") and the Walloon province of Hainaut ("Henegouwen") in Belgium, on France, and the North Sea. Its capital is Bruges ("Brugge"). It has an area of 3,125 kmÂ² which is divided into eight administrative districts ("arrondissementen") containing 64 municipalities.
The whole Belgian North Sea coast, an important tourism destination, lies in West Flanders. A tram line runs the length of the coast, from De Panne on the French border, via the port of Ostend ("Oostende"), to Knokke-Heist on the Dutch frontier.
