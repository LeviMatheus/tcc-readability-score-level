Orcas ("Orcinus orca") are cetaceans. They are the largest dolphins in the world. They have mostly black skin with white patches.
Also called killer whales, orcas hunt fish, squid, and even other marine mammals. Groups of them sometimes kill large whales, eating their lips and tongues. However, they have never been known to harm humans in the wild.
Orcas can also be seen at some marine parks, such as SeaWorld. At marine parks, they are well liked as they are smart, playful, and can do tricks.
