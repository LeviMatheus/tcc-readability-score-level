A woman is a female human adult. We use the word "woman" (one woman, two or more women) to talk about biological sex. A woman has a uterus or "womb". It is a counterpart of a human male, or man. Women give birth to babies and children. Until the middle 1900's woman did not have the right to vote, and were treated with disrespect. The symbol for the goddess Venus is used for women.
