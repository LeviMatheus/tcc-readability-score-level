A clot is a solid substance that blood forms when it is in air. When you bleed, your body wants to stop the bleeding. So it makes a clot.
When blood makes a clot it is also called "coagulation".
If a person falls and gets a cut on their body, that person will bleed. If he bleeds too much he will die. To stop the bleeding, the brain orders a special body part to go and try to lessen the blood flow, so that not as much blood is lost.
