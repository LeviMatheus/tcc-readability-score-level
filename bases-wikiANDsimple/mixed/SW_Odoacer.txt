Odoacer (Flavius Odoacrus/Odovacar/Odowaker/Odoacer; b. around 435, â€  probably March 15, 493 in Ravenna) was a soldier in the army of the West Roman Empire. Perhaps he was of Germanic descent. When he forced the last Western Roman Emperor Romulus Augustus to quit in 476, he became King of Italy. That event is considered the end of Ancient history and the beginning of the Middle Ages.
