Thalassa or Neptune IV, is the second closest moon to Neptune. It was named after a daughter of Aether and Hemera from Greek mythology.
"Thalassa" is also the Greek word for "sea".
Thalassa was discovered sometime before mid-September, 1989 from the images taken by the "Voyager 2" probe. It was given the designation S/1989 N 5. The discovery was said (IAUC 4867) on September 29, 1989, but the text only talks of "25 frames taken over 11 days", giving a discovery date of sometime before September 18. The name was given on 16 September 1991.
Thalassa is not a sphere and shows no sign of any geological changes. Unusually for a non-spherical moon, it appears to be disk-shaped.
