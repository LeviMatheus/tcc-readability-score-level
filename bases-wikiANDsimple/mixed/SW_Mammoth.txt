Mammoths were hairy elephants of the genus "Mammuthus". They lived in Europe until 4,500 years ago. Then all of them were killed by hunters. When they were living in Europe, it was very cold there. There were lots of ice ages. An "age" here means "a very long period of time". In ice ages, the whole world was much colder than it is now. Big sheets of ice covered much of the ground. The time of ice ages the mammoths lived in is called the Pleistocene epoch. An epoch is an even longer time than an age and mammoth were hunted mostly by hunters for their teeth and flesh.
