Tsar Bomba was the largest, most powerful nuclear weapon ever used. It was originally tested by the Soviet Union on October 30, 1961. It was a three stage H bomb.
This bomb is also called the "Father of Bombs". Two were built, one real while the other was a fake, meant to distract attention. See footage of the explosion here
