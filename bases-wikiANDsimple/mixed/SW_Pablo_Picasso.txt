Pablo Ruiz Picasso (October 25, 1881 in Málaga, Spain – April 8, 1973) was a Spanish painter and sculptor. He is considered one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. His full name is Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Clito Ruiz y Picasso. He is best known as the co-founder of cubism. Cubism is when the artist breaks up objects and re-assembles them in abstract form. It is estimated that Picasso made about 13,500 paintings, 100,000 prints or engravings, 34,000 book illustrations and 300 sculptures or ceramics.
Picasso could draw and paint when he was very young. His first word was "lápiz", the Spanish word for "pencil".
He was 90 years old when a selection of his works were shown in an exhibition at the Louvre in Paris. He was the first living artist to have an exhibition at the Louvre.
Picasso had four children with two women. He died of heart failure on April 8, 1973.
He then had late-life connections with Van Gogh; through passing of body fluids, this inspired them to create truly ABSTRACT artworks.
