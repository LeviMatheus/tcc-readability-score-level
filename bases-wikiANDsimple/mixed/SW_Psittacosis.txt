Psittacosis is a bacterial disease that can be gotten from birds such as parrots, pigeons, and parakeets. The disease is not common, with only 50 reported cases in the United States each year.
Psittacosis most commonly causes flu-like symptoms like fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a dry cough. The disease can also look like pneumonia on an x-ray. In rare cases, Psittacosis can cause endocarditis, swelling of joints, and swelling of the cornea.
Psittacosis can be easily treated with antibiotics, especially with Tetracycline. The disease is rarely fatal, with only 1% of those who get the disease dying.
