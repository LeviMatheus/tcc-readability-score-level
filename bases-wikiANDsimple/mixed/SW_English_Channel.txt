The English Channel is a body of water that separates the island of Great Britain from the rest of Europe. People who live in the UK and want to visit Europe, or people from Europe who want to visit the UK, can take a ferry across or ride a train under the channel in a special tunnel called the Channel Tunnel (nicknamed the "Chunnel"). It is 563 km long, 246 km wide, and its narrowest part (34 km) is the Strait of Dover. Many people swam across the English Channel. Gertrude Ederle was the first woman to swim across the Channel.
