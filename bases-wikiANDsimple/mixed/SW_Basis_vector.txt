Basis vector is the way of simply making magenta,yellow and red. The primary colors (or primary colours) are colors that cannot be created by mixing other colors in a given color space. Traditionally, the colors red, yellow, and blue are considered to be primary pigments in the art world. However those colors are not the same hue as the "red", "yellow" and "blue" used in alternate color systems. Many modern applications use primary additive colors of red, green and blue; and the primary pigments (i.e. subtractive primaries) of magenta, yellow, and cyan. If the color space is considered as a vector space, the primary colors can be regarded as a set of basis vectors for that space.
