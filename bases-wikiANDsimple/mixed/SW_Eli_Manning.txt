Elisha Nelson "Eli" Manning (born January 3, 1981 in New Orleans, Louisiana) is an American football player. He is the quarterback for the New York Giants in the National Football League (NFL). Eli is the younger brother of Peyton Manning.
Manning played college football at the University of Mississippi after attending high school at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. Manning was called the Most Valuable Player of the forty-second Super Bowl, which was played on February 3, 2008. In that game, he led the New York Giants to an unexpected win over the New England Patriots.
When Manning entered the NFL Draft (which is where professional American football teams choose new players for their teams), he was first chosen by the San Diego Chargers. But, the same day that the San Diego Chargers chose Manning, they decided to allow him to play for the New York Giants. In return, the New York Giants allowed Philip Rivers to join the San Diego Chargers. The New York Giants also allowed the San Diego Chargers to choose more players the next time the NFL Draft happened.
