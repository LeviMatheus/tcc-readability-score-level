A square kilometre (sometimes written "kmÂ²") is based on the SI unit of measurement of area, the "square metre". It is the area inside a square that has each side equal to 1 kilometre (1000 metres). This way of talking about area is often used to say how much land there is, on a farm or in a city, for example.
One square kilometre is just less than 0.39 square miles.
