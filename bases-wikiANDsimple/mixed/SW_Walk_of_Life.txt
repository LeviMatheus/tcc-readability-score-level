"Walk of Life" is the second album by pop singer Billie Piper, released in 2000. Piper's second album did not match the sucsessful start in terms of album sales despite producing three Top 30 singles - "Day and Night" went to #1 and "Something Deep Inside" managed to get to #4 and "Walk of Life" finishing at #25 on the UK charts.
Despite good reviews, the album was not released in the US. Piper then decided have a break from the music industry and concentrate on acting.
