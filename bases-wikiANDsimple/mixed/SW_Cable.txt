A cable is made of many wires or optical fibers twisted together to make a larger wire. Each of these wires may be covered. Some cables contain both electrical wires and optical fibers. Electrical cables are usually made of copper, because electricity moves very well through copper. They are sometimes made of aluminium because it is cheaper.
