About the show.
The television show "The Simpsons" was originally shown as short shows on "The Tracy Ullman Show". Then Fox decided to give them their own show in 1989. However, some say that there was a show very similar to the Simpsons before.
Chalkboard gag.
Many episodes open with a scene of Springfield Elementary School, where Bart Simpson is shown writing lines on a chalkboard as punishment for being naughty. The line is always humorous. Not every episode has a new one and sometimes the chalkboard gag may be cut because there is not enough time.
Couch gag.
In the opening, all the Simpsons come home to the family. After Homer Simpson is almost hit by Marge's car, they all go into the living room, where again something humorous happens. One such gag was when Homer Simpson walked onto the screen like James Bond and shot the camera, a homage to the James Bond gun barrel sequence. Sometimes if an episode is a short one, then a very long couch gag will happen. A couple of Couch Gags have been over one minute long.
Ending credits.
At the end of the show, the credits are shown. Sometimes they be changed. in one episode, the ending showed Homer reading from a document about Dateline. In another episode, where all of the character sung in song, the character Snake kept firing his gun in order to make the music that was playing stop.
Movie.
A film based on the show,The Simpsons Movie, was released in 2007.
