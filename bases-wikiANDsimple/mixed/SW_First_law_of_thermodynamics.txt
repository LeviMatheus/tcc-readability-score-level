The first law of thermodynamics says that heat transfer is a form of energy transfer and that energy does not vanish (law of conservation of energy).
History.
James Prescott Joule was the first person who found out by experiments that heat and work are convertible.
The first explicit statement of the first law of thermodynamics was given by "Rudolf Clausius" in 1850: "There is a state function E, called `energy', whose differential equals the work exchanged with the surroundings during an adiabatic process."
Thermodynamics and Engineering.
Because of this ambiguity, it is vitally important in any discussion involving the first law to explicitly establish the sign convention in use.
