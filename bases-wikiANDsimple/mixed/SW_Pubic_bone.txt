The pubic bone is one of the bones that make up the pelvis. It is ventral and anterior.
It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis.
It is divisible into a body, a superior ramus and an inferior ramus.
The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, contributing by its external surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa. Its internal surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a portion of the obturator internus.
In the female, the pubic bone is anterior to the urethral sponge.
The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis.
