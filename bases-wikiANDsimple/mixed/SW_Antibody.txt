Antibodies (also called Immunoglobulins (Ig)) are special proteins. They are found in the blood or other body fluids of vertebrates. The immune system uses antibodies to identify foreign objects, such as bacteria and viruses. These objects are then neutralized, so that they can no longer cause problems and diseases.
Each antibody is different. They are all designed to attack only one kind of virus or bacteria. For instance, an antibody designed to destroy smallpox are unable to hit the Bubonic plauge or the common cold. An antibody resembles the letter "Y". At the two ends of the "Y" are specially shaped antigens that can only insert themselves in one type of germ. This is needed, because every antibody is different. When the antibody finds the germ it's after, it "knows" because of its special antigen. If the antibody can insert its antigen into the germ, it will go to work either destroying it by blocking it from "germ food" (cells), or calling white blood cells to eat it, thereby killing whatever it was after.
It is the job of the "humoral" section of the immune system to make antibodies.
Antibodies can be found almost anywhere in the blood. If a doctor were to look at one, he or she would call it a globulin, because that is what it is shaped like.
Antibodies are also made by special "B Cells" in the immune system. B cells only attack when their antibodies tell them to. Once alerted, the B cell goes to work, breaking germs down into nothing but harmless goo. In some cases, a B cell can't do it alone. When that happens, a T helper cell is called in to help.
