In human beings, the cerebellum is one of the main divisions of the brain.
The cerebellum integrates signals from eyes, muscle spindles, and ears with motor commands from the forebrain and helps coordinate motor activity. More recent expansions of the human cerebellum may be crucial to language and other forms of mental dexterity. Bands of axons extend from the cerebellum into the pons.
