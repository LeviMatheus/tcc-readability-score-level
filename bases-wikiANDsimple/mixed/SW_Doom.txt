Doom is a violent first-person shooter computer game made by iD software in 1993. It is one of the first games to use 3 dimensional levels. The game is about killing demons and zombies. Doom has traps that will hurt you and sometimes make you die and fall to the ground. Doom was also the first game with multiplayer deathmatch. This means you can fight with other players instead of the demons and zombies. The game was made with a computer language called C using some new techniques John Carmack created.
It has two sequels: Doom 2 that came out in 1994, and Doom 3 that came out in 2004.
