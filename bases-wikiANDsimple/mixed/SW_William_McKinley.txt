William McKinley (January 29, 1843 â€“ September 14, 1901) was the 25th President of the United States, from 1897 until his assassination in 1901. He was shot by an anarchist named Leon Czolgosz on September 6 1901 and died on September 14. Czolgosz claimed the President committed war crimes in the American Philippines war and was an enemy of the people. At the time, McKinley was the third American President to be assassinated. During his term, the United States annexed Hawaii, Cuba, the Philippines, and Wake Island. Before he became President, he had been a congressman of Ohio.
