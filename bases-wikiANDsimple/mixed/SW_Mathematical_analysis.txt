Analysis is about limits. We can use limits to see what happens very close to things. We can also use limits to see what happens when things get very big. For example, formula_1 is never zero, but as n gets bigger formula_1 gets close to zero. The limit of formula_1 as n gets bigger is zero. We usually say "The limit of formula_1 as n goes to infinity is zero". We write formula_5.
The fundamental theorem of algebra is a proven fact that forms the basis for complex analysis. It says that every polynomial with real or complex coefficients has a complex root. A root is a solution to a function for which the number "x" gives formula_6. Some of these roots may be the same.
