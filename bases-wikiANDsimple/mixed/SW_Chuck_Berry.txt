Charles Edward Anderson "Chuck" Berry (born October 18, 1926 in St. Louis, Missouri) is an American singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is one of the original rock and roll musicians; he, along with others, invented rock music. In 1955 he met Muddy Waters who told him of a record company that would release his first song. In 1957 he joined the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly and other popular musicians on a tour around the United States. Over the next few years he became more and more popular and many of his songs became some the most bought and listened to songs at the time. He has influenced a lot of rock and pop musicians who came after him. Most of those people were guitar players, just like Chuck Berry himself.
