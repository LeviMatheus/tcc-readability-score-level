Team rocket is a gang of thieves in the TV series Pokémon. They steal legendary Pokémon for their boss Giovani from other Pokémon trainers. The gang is made up of Jessie James and Meowth (a Pokémon).
Jessie and James.
In many cases of the series either in the game or anime, Jessie could be seen as the typical Team Rocket Female and James could be seen as the regular Team Rocket Male; in the Anime Jessie and James follow the Laws of their organization but they dislike the way it's done (I.E. the outfits and the motto) so they change it to suit what they like best.
Butch: Green haired Male Female Agent whom is top ranked, he follows Cassidy and assists her in what ever job they have to do. Butch is also the rival of James and as a recurring joke, many character forget his name calling him something like "Botch" or "Biff", to which he gets extremely upset over.
Cassidy: Yellow haired Female Agent whom is top ranked, she is the unofficial leader of the two and for the most part is the rival of Jessie.
