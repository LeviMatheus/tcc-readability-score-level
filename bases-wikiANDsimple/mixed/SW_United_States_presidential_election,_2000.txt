The United States presidential election of 2000 was a contest between Democratic candidate Al Gore, then-Vice President, and Republican candidate George W. Bush, then-governor of Texas and son of former president George H. W. Bush (1989-1993). Bill Clinton, the incumbent President, had been in office for two terms, the most allowed by the Twenty-second Amendment. Bush narrowly won the November 7 election, with 271 electoral votes to Gore's 266. There was a disagreement over who won Florida's 25 electoral votes, the recount that happened there, and the uncommon event that the winner got less popular votes than the loser.
