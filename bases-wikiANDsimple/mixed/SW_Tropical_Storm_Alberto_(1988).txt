Tropical Storm Alberto became a tropical storm further north than any other Atlantic tropical cyclone. The first tropical storm of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed from a trough of low pressure off of the coast of South Carolina on August 5. It tracked quickly northeastward, and intensified into a tropical storm at its record latitude on August 7 while located about 60 miles (95 km) east of the Massachusetts island of Nantucket. Alberto continued its fast forward motion, and struck western Nova Scotia late on August 7. It became extratropical the next day, and dissipated shortly thereafter to the north of Newfoundland. Alberto produced light rainfall and gusty winds across its path. No damage was reported.
