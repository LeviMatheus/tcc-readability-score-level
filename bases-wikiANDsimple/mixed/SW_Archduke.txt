The title of Archduke (feminine: Archduchess) (German: "Erzherzog", feminine form: "Erzherzogin") is a rank above Duke and under King, but is very rare. It was used only by princes of the House of Habsburg.
Ruler style.
The English word is recorded only since 1530, derived from Middle Latin "archidux", from "arch(i)-" (see arch- (adj.)) + "dux" 'duke'.
Archduke ("Erzherzog") is a title distinct from Grand Duke ("Großherzog" or "Großfürst") that is used in some other German royal houses and still in sovereign Luxemburg.
