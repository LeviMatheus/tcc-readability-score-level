British Rail Class D2/7 was a locomotive commissioned by British Rail in England. It was a diesel powered locomotive in the pre-TOPS period built by Hudswell Clarke with a Gardner engine. The mechanical transmission, using a scoop control fluid coupling and three-speed "Power-flow SSS" (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox, was a Hudswell Clarke speciality.
