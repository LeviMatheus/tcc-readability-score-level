A magnet is a very special metal. When a magnet goes near some other metals or other magnets, and the poles (sides) touching are oppisite, it will pull, or "attract" the other metal or magnet closer. Also, if the two poles are the same, the two magnets will push away, or "repel", from each other. This is called "magnetism". Magnets can make some other metals into magnets when they are rubbed together, which is quite intresting. A "soft" or "impermanent" magnet is one which loses its memory of previous magnetizations. "Soft" magnetic materials are often used in electromagnets to enhance (often hundreds or thousands of times) the magnetic field of a wire that carries an electrical current and is wrapped around the magnet; the field of the "soft" magnet increases with the current. Permanent magnets occur naturally in some rocks, particularly lodestone, but are now more commonly manufactured. A magnet's magnetism decreases when it is heated and increases when it is cooled. It has to be heated at around 1000 degrees Celsius. There are only four magnetic metals - they are iron, nickel, steel and cobalt.
