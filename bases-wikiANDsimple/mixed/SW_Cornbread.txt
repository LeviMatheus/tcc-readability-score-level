Cornbread or Johnny cake is a name for any number of "quick breads"- bread leavened chemically instead of by yeast- containing cornmeal. As maize (also known as corn) is native to North America, the various kinds of cornbreads are more prevalent there. In Italy, the corn-based mush known as polenta is sometimes fashioned into a fried form resembling cornbread.
