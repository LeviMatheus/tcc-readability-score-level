"The Masque of the Red Death" is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1842.
Plot.
The story takes place at the abbey of Prince Prospero. Prospero and one thousand other nobles have fled to a walled abbey to escape the Red Death, a terrible plague that started in the country. The symptoms of the Red Death are terrible: the victim has convulsions and sweats blood instead of water. The plague is said to kill within half an hour. Prospero and his court show their indifference to the sufferings of the population and intend to await the end of the plague in luxury and safety behind the walls of their abbey.
The development of the plot shows that their attitude is wrong.
