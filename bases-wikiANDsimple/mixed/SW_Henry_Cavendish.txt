Henry Cavendish (October 10, 1731 - February 24, 1810) was a British scientist. He is famous for discovering hydrogen.
He measured the earth's mass and density with Cavendish Experiment.
He studied at Peterhouse College, which is part of the University of Cambridge but he couldn't graduate in there.
He built a laboratory near London, where vhe worked for nearly fifty years, but he only published about 20 scientific papers. Evenso, he is called one of the greatest scientist of his period.
Cavendish claimed that the force between the two electrical objects is inversely proportional to their distance's square. He explained the concept of electric potential, which was already known in Math but had been never used in electrical experiments until that day. He developed the thought of all points on a good conductor's surface have the same potential energy beside a common reference point. Because of no possibility to measure electric current, he used his body as a machine which measures strength of electric current. All Cavendish's explorations in his notebook was found and confirmed by James Clerk Maxwell.
