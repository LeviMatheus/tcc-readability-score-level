The salivary glands make saliva. Saliva keeps the mouth and other parts of the digestive system wet. It also helps break down carbohydrates (with salivary amylase, formerly known as ptyalin) and keeps food wet and slippery so it can go down from the oro-pharynx to the esophagus to the stomach.
There are three main pairs of salivary glands. They are
There are also many small glands in the tongue, cheeks, lips and palate. All of those glands make mucous.
Histology (The cells in the salivary gland).
There are two types of epithelial cells in salivary glands. They make either mucous or serous secretions. The parotid gland makes serous secretions. The submandibular and submaxillary glands have both types of cells. They make a mixture of mucous and serous.
Classification(Different kinds of salivary glands).
The three types of salivary glands are serous mixed and mucous glands.
Structure (How the salivary glands are built).
The small tubes go into ducts. Those ducts go into larger ducts that have little stripes on them, called striations. Those go into ducts between the lobes of the gland (called interlobar or excretory ducts). The main duct of the salivary glands then goes into the mouth.
Role in disease.
Salivary duct calculus may block the ducts. This would cause pain and swelling of the gland.
Tumors of the salivary glands can occur. These are usually benign, but can be malignant. The most common type of benign tumor is Pleomorphic adenoma, followed by Warthin's tumor. The most common malignant tumor is Mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Diagnostic investigation.
A sialogram is a radiocontrast study of a salivary duct.
