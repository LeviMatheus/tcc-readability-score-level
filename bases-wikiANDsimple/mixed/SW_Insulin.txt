Insulin is a hormone,made by the pancreas, in the body that controls the glucose level in the blood.
People who cannot make insulin in their bodies, or who make it but their body cannot use it properly, have the disease diabetes. Insulin breaks down sugars and starches.
Some people with diabetes can take in insulin from outside their bodies instead of producing their own insulin.
History.
Insulin was first found to affect the levels of glucose in the body in 1921 when Dr. Frederick Banting and Dr. Best experimented whilst trying to find a cure for diabetes. In these experiments they used dogs.
They first knew insulin would control diabetes in a person when they injected some insulin into a 14 year old boy who was dying of diabetes. He didn't die. After the injection he survived.
The boy's name was Leonard Thompson.
