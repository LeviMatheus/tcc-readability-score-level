The Hunsrück is a low mountain range in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.
It is bounded by the river valleys of the Moselle (north), the Nahe (south), and the Rhine (east). The Hunsrück is continued by the Taunus mountains on the eastern side of the Rhine. In the north behind the Moselle it is continued by the Eifel. To the south of the Nahe, there is the Palatinate.
Many of the hills are not higher than 400 m. But there are several chains of higher peaks within the Hunsrück, all bearing names on their own: the (Schwarzwälder) Hochwald, the Idarwald, the Soonwald, and the Binger Wald. The highest peak is the Erbeskopf (816 m).
Towns in the Hunsrück include Simmern, Kirchberg, and Idar-Oberstein, Kastellaun, and Morbach. Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, a growing low-fare carrier and cargo airport is there as well.
The climate in the Hunsrück is characterised by rainy weather. Slate is mined in the mountains.
The German TV drama trilogy "Heimat", directed by Edgar Reitz, examined the 20th-century life of a small fictional village in the Hunsrück.
