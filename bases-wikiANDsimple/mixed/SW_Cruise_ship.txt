A cruise ship (or cruise liner) is a large ship with sleeping cabins that takes people on holiday and vacationtrips. Hundreds of thousands of people take cruises each year. Cruise ship vacations usually cost about $600 US per week per person. This includes meals in the ship's restaurant and a small cabin to live in.
Today's cruise ships are like floating hotels. They have a complete "hospitality staff" (to serve food and help passengers in other ways) as well as the usual ship's crew. The largest cruise ships have casinos, shops, many restaurants, several pools, and a running track. The most expensive cruises often have more crew and staff than passengers. This means that the people who control the cruise can give many personal services.
Today, hundreds of cruise ships sail all over the world. Some carry over 3,000 passengers. These are some of the largest ships ever built. For some places, such as Antarctica, cruise ships are one of the only way for tourists to visit.
