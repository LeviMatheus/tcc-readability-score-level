Introversion and Extroversion, made up by Carl Jung in the 1920s, is one theory that describes how a person gets energy from the world. Many people associate "introverts" with being quiet and shy, and "extroverts" with being loud and sociable. According to the theory, introverts get energy from inside themselves (ideas and concepts in their own minds), and extroverts get energy from outside of themselves (interacting with other people).
Those who follow this way of looking at the world say that everyone has some parts of both traits in them, though one will usually dominate over the other. At one time, extroverts were thought to make up almost three-fourths of American society. Now, researchers typically assume that the number of extroverts is pretty much equal to the number of introverts in the country.
