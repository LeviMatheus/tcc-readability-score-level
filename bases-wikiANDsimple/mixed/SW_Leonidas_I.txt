Leonidas was a king of Sparta. He was the 17th of the Agiad family of kings. His father was Anaxandridas II, who was thought to be a descendant of Heracles. He took the throne probably in 489 or 488 BC. His queen was Gorgo. Leonidasâ€™ name is now very well known because of the battle of Thermopylae.
Invasion of Persia.
In 480 BC the Persians with their king Xerxes invaded Greece. When the united Greek forces invited the Spartans to join the rest of the army against the Persians, the Spartans went to the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle gave a prophecy: either Sparta would fall or the Spartans would lose a king.
Fighting back.
In August 480 BC, Leonidas went to Thermopylae with 300 of his personal bodyguards. Other Greek forces joined him there and formed an army of 4,200 soldiers. This army would try to hold the pass of Thermopylae against the great army of Xerxes I, who was the king of Persia.
After the battle.
Only 2 Spartans survived. One was Kirtanian, who was injured and was sent behind the lines. The other one was Pantites, who was sent by Leonidas to raise support in Thessaly, but returned to Thermopylae only after the battle was finished. At the end, he hanged himself because he was called a coward.
