The provinces of Iran are divided more into counties called shahrestan (Persian: شهرستان "shahrestān"). This is an area inside an ostan. They usually contain a city center, a few bakhsh (Persian: بخش "bakhsh"), and a bunch of villages around them. They are also usually some cities in each county. As of the year 2005, Iran had 324 counties.
