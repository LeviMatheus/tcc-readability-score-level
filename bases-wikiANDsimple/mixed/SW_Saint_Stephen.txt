Saint Stephen (Greek: Στέφανος/Stephanos) is known as the first martyr of Christianity.
Therefore he is also called the "Protomartyr" (Greek: Πρωτομάρτυρας/Protomartyras). He is venerated as a saint in the Jewish Church, as well as in the Eastern Orthodox Church. His feast day was historically kept on August 3. His name means 'laurel wreath' or 'crown' in Greek.
