291 Alice is an asteroid in the Flora family in the Main Belt.
It was found by Johann Palisa on April 25, 1890 in Vienna.
Lightcurve analysis indicates that Alice's pole points towards either ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (55°, 65°) or (β, λ) = (55°, 245°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of about 35° in both cases.
