Habemus Papam refers to the announcement given in Latin by the Senior Cardinal Deacon when a new Pope has been chosen.
The announcement is given from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. After the announcement, the new pope meets the people and he gives his first Urbi et Orbi blessing to the crowd.
In the most recent Habemus Papam, given by Jorge Cardinal Medina Est√©vez on 19 April 2005 upon the election of Pope Benedict XVI, the announcement was made after a greeting ("Dear Brothers and Sisters") in several languages (Italian, Spanish, French, German, and English).
