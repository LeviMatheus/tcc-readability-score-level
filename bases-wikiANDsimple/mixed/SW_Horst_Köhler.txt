Horst Köhler (born February 22, 1943 in Skierbieszów, Poland) became president of the Federal Republic of Germany July 1, 2004. Before that he was the director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
On March 4, 2004 he was nominated by members of the German political parties CDU, CSU, and FDP. They wanted him to be their common candidate for the presidential election on May 23, 2004. For this reason he gave up his position as director of the IMF.
Before his nomination he worked outside of Germany, so only 20% of the Germans knew him, and a German newspaper called 'Bild' headlined 'Horst Wer???' which means 'Horst Who???'.
On May 23, 2004 the German "Bundesversammlung" (Federal Assembly), which consist of 1.205 members, chose Horst Köhler as the new "Bundespräsident" (President of Germany) with 604 votes. That was one vote more than the needed absolute majority.
