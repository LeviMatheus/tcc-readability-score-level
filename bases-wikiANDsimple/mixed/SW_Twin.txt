Twins are two animal (including human) offspring that are born from the same pregnancy.
"Human twins" are two people that shared the uterus during a single pregnancy, and one is normally born quickly after the first. Because of the size of the uterus, multiple pregnancies are less likely to last the full 38 weeks than most single birth pregnancies. On average, they last 35 weeks. This also means about 50% of twins is born prematurely.
Fraternal twins.
Fraternal twins, also known as "non-identical twins" or "dizygotic twins": Two separate ova are fertilized, which each becomes a zygote. The two zygotes grow into two genetically different beings.
Identical twins.
Identical twins or "monozygotic twins": A single ovum is fertilized to form one zygote. This zygote later splits, and each half of the zygote becomes a twin. The twins have the same genes.
Semi-identical twins.
Semi-identical twins: A single ovum is fertilized by two sperm cells, and splits. The twins have the same genes from their mother's side, but each twin has different genes from their father's side.
Other animals.
Twinning is common in many other animals, such as cats, sheep, and ferrets. Twinning occurs in cattle about 1-4% of the time, and research is underway to improve the odds of twinning, which can be more profitable for the breeder if complications can be sidestepped or managed.
