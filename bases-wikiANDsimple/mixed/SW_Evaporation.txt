Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas. When the molecules in a liquid are heated, they move faster. This makes them full of energy and so the particles will just "kill" each and eventually they become so far apart that they become a gas.
The more heat there is the faster evaporating is.
Water boils at around 100 degrees Celsius.
There are many factors that affect the evaporation rate.
Some liquids evaporate at different temperatures, such as alcohol, which evaporates at 87 degrees celsius. Basically, water dries up and disapears in the air.When water is evaporating it transforms into a gas called water vapor. Evaporation of water can be seen by the gradual disappearance of the amount of water.the reverse of evaporation is condensation. Evaporation is a very essential part of the water cycle and it sometimes happens at the same time as condensation when water is boiling in a closed container.
