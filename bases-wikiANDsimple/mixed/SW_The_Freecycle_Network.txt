The Freecycle Network (TFN) is a global network of people who share and regive items. They organise their network through the Internet. Freecycle is a place for people to meet. There are just two things people can do there.
The first thing is this: A person can ask the other people for an item. If someone has it, they can tell the person who wants it.
The second thing is this: A person can give away an item. Sometimes many people want the item, and the donator has to choose just one person.
