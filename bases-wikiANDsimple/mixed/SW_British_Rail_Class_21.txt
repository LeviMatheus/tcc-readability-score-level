The North British Type 2 diesel-electric (later known as British Railwaysâ€™ Class 21) was a type of diesel locomotive built by the North British Locomotive Company in Glasgow for British Railways in 1958-1960.
Starting in 2007, the classification has been reused for new Vossloh G1206 acquired by Euro Cargo Rail/EWS.
