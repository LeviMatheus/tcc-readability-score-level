Encyclopædia Dramatica is a website that stores and/or satirizes current events and themes, commonly Internet-related ones. It has been described as a "snarky Wikipedia anti-fansite".
The site is a wiki. The site runs MediaWiki software, that presents its content in an disrespectful, politically incorrect and often abusive style, using links and cross references made to appear commplete, with a great amount of of obscene writings, drawings, photographs. Many articles are written in a satirical manner to upset those who take the content seriously; this practice of causing people into an emotional response is known on the Internet as trolling. The emotional responses are then added to the articles, often in a negative or way, with the purpose of causing further emotional response. The site claims that it is "[d]one in the spirit of Ambrose Bierce's "The Devil's Dictionary".
