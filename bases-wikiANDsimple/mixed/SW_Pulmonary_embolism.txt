A pulmonary embolism is a clot of material that blocks blood from getting to the lungs. It most often is caused by a blood clot, but it can also be caused by clumped cancer cells, fat, bone, or rarely amniotic fluid, affecting mothers during birth.
A pulmonary embolism causes sudden shortness of breath, rapid breathing, chest pain, coughing up blood. In rare cases, it can cause rapid heart beat, low blood pressure, shock, and death.
Pulmonary embolisms are separated into two categories: Acute and Chronic. Acute Pulmonary Embolisms are normally sudden, while Chronic Pulmonary Embolisms are not.
It is most often treated with anticoagulants, making it so the blood can no longer clot.
