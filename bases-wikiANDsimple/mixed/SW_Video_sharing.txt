Video sharing is when one person shares a video clip with another or many other people. This is usually done over the Internet. There are many websites that offer video sharing. Many people use theses sites to share videos they have made with their family and friends. But, sharing videos which are copyrighted, like television programs, without permission from those who own them might be illegal.
