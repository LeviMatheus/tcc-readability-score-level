The Universal House of Justice is the name of a council that leads the Bahá'í community. It was described by the person who made the Bahá'í Faith, Bahá'u'lláh, in his books and letters. He called it the Supreme House of Justice. His son, `Abdu'l-Bahá called it the Universal House of Justice, because it was going to lead all of the Bahá'ís. There will be other "Houses of Justice" for each country and city, but for now these are called "Spiritual Assemblies."
Bahá'ís vote for the members of this council every five years during a special festival held between April 20 and May 2.
