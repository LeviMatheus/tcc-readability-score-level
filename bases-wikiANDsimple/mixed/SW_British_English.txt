Pronunciation (The Way People Say Things) in British English.
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near London may not say his "r"s the same as a man from Scotland or a man from Northern Ireland. In fact, people in some places in the United Kingdom have spoken different languages in the past, and some places still speak those languages today. In some places, the way people speak is changed by knowing the other language, such as Gaelic. Other times, peoples' English accent (the way they sound when they speak English) has been changed by the groups people socialize in.
The accent that actors use in television from the BBC is called Received Pronunciation, sometimes called "The Queen's (or King's) English", or "BBC English".
Vocabulary in British English.
In British English, "dock" refers to the water in the space between two "piers" or "wharfs". In American English, the "pier" or "wharf" could be called a "dock", and the water between would be a "slip".
