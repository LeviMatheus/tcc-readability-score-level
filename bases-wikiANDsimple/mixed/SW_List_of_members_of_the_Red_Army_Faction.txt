This is a list of Members of the Red Army Faction. After Andreas Baader escaped from jail in 1970, the media began referring to the "Baader-Meinhoff Gang". When Baader and Meinhof were arrested, they became known as the Red Army Faction.
First generation.
These are the earliest members, from the late 1960s. The most important had all been arrested by 1972.
Second generation Red Army Faction.
Other young terrorists available to swell the shrinking ranks of the Gang. Like the first generation they were mostly middle class and a lot of them were students. A lot of them were terrorists who joined the Gang after their own groups dissolved (e.g. the Socialist Patients' Collective (SPK), J2M).
The SPK, the leftist, 'therapy-through-violence' group, dissolved in 1971, and those members who had turned militant forged links and joined with the Baader-Meinhof Gang. There were quite a few of them and below is a selected list of some of the major members.
Third Generation Red Army Faction.
This generation was active mostly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. More vicious than their predecessors, they didn't have as much cause as the earlier generations to rebel.
