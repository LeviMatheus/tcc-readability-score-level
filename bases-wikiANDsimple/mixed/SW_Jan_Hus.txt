Jan Hus/John Huss'", born circa 1369 in Husinec, Bohemia (now Czech Republic) was a Bohemian religious thinker and reformer. He started a religious movement based on the ideas of John Wyclif. His followers became known as Hussites. The Roman Catholic Church has not tolerated such heresies. Hus was excommunicated in 1411, condemned by the Council of Constance, and burned at the stake on July 6, 1415, in Konstanz (aka Constance), Germany.
What he taught.
Many of his teachings were later taken up by Martin Luther who also published some of the things he wrote in prison.
