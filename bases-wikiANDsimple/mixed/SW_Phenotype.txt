The phenotype of an individual organism describes one of its traits or characteristics. This trait is measurable. Only some individuals of that population will show the trait.. Examples include
"blue eyes", or "aggressive behavior". Some phenotypes are controlled entirely by the individual's genes. Others are controlled by genes but can be influenced by environmental factors. Still other phenotypes are entirely nongenetic, for example, a person's language or physical traits that were altered by surgery.
Many phenotypes are determined by many genes and can also be influenced by environmental factors. Thus, the identity of one or a few alleles of an organism does not always enable prediction of its phenotype.
Scientists use easily observable phenotypes to deduce an organism's genotype. They analyse complex phenotypes to help hypothesize about how individual genes work.
