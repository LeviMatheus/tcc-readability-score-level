Cardiff is the capital and biggest city of Wales, in Great Britain. Its name in the Welsh language is Caerdydd. 325,000 people live in Cardiff. It is the most important city in Wales for tourism, culture, government, sport, transport, nightlife and business.
Cardiff has a big port that used to be known as Tiger Bay, now just called Cardiff Bay, where the Welsh government works and now there are lots of shops, pubs and restaurants. Cardiff has an international airport, and is twinned with Nantes in France and Stuttgart in Germany. Cardiff has one of the largest stadiums in the United Kingdom, the Millennium Stadium, where important sports matches happen.
