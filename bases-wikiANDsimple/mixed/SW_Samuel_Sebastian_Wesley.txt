Samuel Sebastian Wesley (born London, 14 August 1810; died 19 April 1876) was an English organist and composer. He was the greatest English composer of church music of his day.
He was born in London, the illegitimate son of the composer Samuel Wesley and his partner Sarah Suter. After singing in the choir of the Chapel Royal as a boy, he, become organist of Hereford Cathedral in 1832. He moved to Exeter Cathedral three years later, and then had jobs at Leeds Parish Church, Winchester Cathedral and Gloucester Cathedral.
His music was almost all composed for the Church of England. He wrote many anthems, including "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace", "Blessed be the God and Father", "The Wilderness" and "Ascribe unto the Lord". They are verse anthems (anthem which contrast sections for the full choir with sections for a few soloists).
The popular short anthem "Lead me Lord" is part of "Praise the Lord, O my soul".
