Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) are gases used in refrigerant and aerosols: a gas containing carbon, (sometimes hydrogen,) chlorine, and fluorine, used as a refrigerant and aerosol propellant. In 1978, Sweden became the first country that banned CFC products. Later, the US and Canada did the same. Nowadays, in most countries the use of CFC products are not allowed to be used, because they are destroying the ozone layer. CFCs also are greenhouse gases, creating a man-made greenhouse effect.
Because they are no longer used in some places, an alternative is used,hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). They do not destroy the ozone layer or contribute to global warming.
