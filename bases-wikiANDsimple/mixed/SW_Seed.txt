A seed is the part of a plant that the plant makes that can grow into a new plant, by planting near another plant. There are many different kinds of seeds. Some plants make a lot of seeds, some make only a few. Seeds are often hard and very small, but some are larger. The coconut is a seed which can be as big as a child's head. A seed needs water, air and warmth but not sunlight to germinate (become a seedling).
Because most kinds of seeds carry the food that helps the new plant begin to grow, many kinds of seeds are good food for animals and people. Seeds are often inside fruits. The many kinds of grain that people grow, such as rice, wheat, and maize, are all seeds.
The seed also has a seed coat. The seed coat is an outer covering that protects the seed.
