787 Moskva is a minor planet orbiting the Sun in the asteroid belt.
The object 1914 UQ found on April 20, 1914 by G. N. Neujmin was named 787 Moskva (and continues to have that name to this day). The object 1934 FD found on March 19, 1934 by C. Jackson was given the sequence number 1317. In 1938, G. N. Neujmin found that asteroid 1317 and 787 Moskva were one and the same object. The sequence number 1317 was later used again for the object 1935 RC found on September 1, 1935 by Karl Reinmuth; that object is now known as 1317 Silvretta.
