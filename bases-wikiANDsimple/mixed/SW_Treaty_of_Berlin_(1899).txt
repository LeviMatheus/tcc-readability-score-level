The Treaty of Berlin was signed on 14 November, 1899 between the United States, Germany, and the British.
Before the treaty was signed, the British, Germans, and Americans wanted Samoa to trade with. Based on the treaty, Samoa was divided between Germany and the United States. Western Samoa went to Germany, while Eastern Samoa went to the United States.
