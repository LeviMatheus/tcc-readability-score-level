An out in baseball happens to the pitcher in a game. When there are 3 strikes, the other team goes up to bat. Other ways to get an out are if a baseball is caught while in the air and before it touches the ground. Another way is to be struck out. To be struck out you have to miss trying to hit the ball three times.
