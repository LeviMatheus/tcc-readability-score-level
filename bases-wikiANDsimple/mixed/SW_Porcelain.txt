Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating selected and refined materials to high temperatures. This often includs clay in the form of kaolinite.
Raw materials for porcelain, when mixed with water, form a plastic paste that can be worked to a required shape before firing in a kiln at temperatures between about 1200 and 1400 degrees Celsius.
