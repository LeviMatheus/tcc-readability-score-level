It is located in the north of Canada, and has a particularly cold climate for much of the year. It has a large native population (mainly Inuit).
The main form of transportation is the snowmobile. For the first week of being a separate unit, it was the Province of Nunavut. But after a week it was renamed Nunavut Territory.
