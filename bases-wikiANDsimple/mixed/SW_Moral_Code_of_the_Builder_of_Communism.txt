The Moral Code of the Builder of Communism was a set of twelve rules. It was made in the Soviet Union by the Communist Party of the USSR.
Every member of the party, and every Komsomol member was supposed to follow these rules.
The Moral Code was made at the 22nd Congress of the CPSU in 1961, as part of the new Party Programme.
The very first moral principle was "Devotion to the cause of communism".
Many people try to compare these rules to the Ten Commandments. The two texts have very little in common though. Russian language books of the time sometimes say that these are founded on the Bible. One of the passages of the Bible cited is "he who does not work, neither shall he eat" (2 Thessalonians 3:10). This text was also used in the Soviet Constitution of 1936.
The rules were thought more as "guidelines". In contrast, the Ten Commandments were made to be rules of conduct, and perhaps even laws. For example, "You shall not commit adultery" of Moses loosely corresponds to "Mutual respect in a family, concern about the upbringing of children" of the Code.
The Code also is about what a person should do as a commitment to the society he or she lives in. It does not speak of personal virtue. For example, the "Do not steal" may be loosely matched to "Concern of everyone about the preservation and multiplication of the common wealth".
Four of the rules, making up one-third of the Code, are of a political character.
The Code contained a number of popular Soviet cliches; in fact it was intentionally formulated to contain catch phrases, either invented by Soviet ideologists, or borrowed. (An example is 'One for all, and all for one' ("каждый за всех, все за одного") which was borrowed from "The Three Musketeers" by Alexandre Dumas, père.)
